# Fosdem 2025

* [x] bring up to date with latest rust / libraries and make repeatable
  * [x] rust `1.75` to `1.82`
  * update dependencies:
    * for each of these, running following to confirm still working:
      ```
      cargo clean
      cargo build
      cargo test
      ``` 
    * [x] do `cargo update` on libraries
    * [x] change dependencies to be specified as minor only
      * needs to be done in all Cargo.toml files i.e. also those in sub-packages
    * [x] update all libraries to latest compatible minor version
      * [x] install https://github.com/killercup/cargo-edit to get `cargo upgrade`
      * [x] run `cargo upgrade --compatible`
  * [x] create repeatable DEVELOPMENT.md / Justfile
    - for at least schedule import, indexing, visualisation generation, and running api (locally)
    - doesn't need to cover slide or video indexing
  * [x] (re)publish to fly.io staging
    - using "fosdem-fly-staging" openai key
  * [x] (re)publish to fly.io main
    - using "fosdem-fly-prod" openai key
* [x] start supporting fosdem 2025 schedule
* [x] upgrade to latest Bulma
  - https://bulma.io/documentation/start/migrating-to-v1/
  * [x] move from bulma 0.9.4 -> 1.0.2
  * [x] add content-integrity attributes to bulma and fontawesome
    - https://www.srihash.org
* [x] basic "bookmarks" system that works between tabs, and across my laptop and phone
  - I'd prefer to avoid something that relies on a fast network connection (wifi can be iffy on the day) or an accounts system (can't be arsed owning/securing/paying for that)
  - So, I'm gonna try to avoid any backend if possible
  - I also want to play with some localfirst stuff :-)
  * [x] works between tabs
    * [x] add hooks to markup that allows a bookmark with a local viewmodel to be enabled/disabled by JS
    * [x] represent the core page model for bookmarks as `data-` attributes on event card
      * [x] set `data-event-id` and initial `data-bookmark-status` from backend (not bookmarked)
      * [x] store state of bookmark in parent element with `data-bookmark-status`
      * [x] style bookmark based on status parent element with `data-bookmark-status` 
      * for each bookmark, find containing event card then:
        * [x] toggle `data-bookmark-status` based on bookmark click
    * [x] use [tinybase](https://tinybase.org) to support sharing between tabs and persistence of `data-bookmark-status`
      * [x] create store
      * [x] set `data-bookmark-status` based on tinybase store (persistence across reloads)
      * [x] use `MutationObserver` on `data-bookmark-status` to update tinybase store based on changes
      * [x] set `data-bookmark-status` based on changes in tinybase store
      * [x] sync between browser tabs
  * [x] add a '/bookmarks' endpoint which can show all items currently bookmarked
    * [x] refactor router into separate module per route
    * [x] add a new route which surfaces all events
    * [x] hide/display based on whether it is bookmarked
    * [x] link in to top nav, but only enable if bookmarks working
  * [x] works between laptop/phone/ipad
    - I'm not going to go for live-sync of all bookmarks and all CRDT state, including deletions. This is for a few reasons:
      - still requires some sort of backend (e.g. for websockets or webrtc or similar). This makes it more complicated and also means I still require a remote connection at some point.
      - it also means I need to have separate "users" if I want to avoid accidentally mixing my bookmarks with anyone else who happens to use the site
    - Instead, I'll use a local transfer system that relies only 'exporting' and 'importing' bookmarks via copy/paste. This will be a merge i.e. this will only export bookmarks that are set and import same. So, it's not syncing two devices to be the same.
    * [x] export all set bookmarks as a text string (via copy)
    * [x] import all bookmarks from a text string (via paste)
* [x] make each event have its own detail page with associated related events
  * [x] extract simple detail page from search pages 
  * [x] make nav links in search go to detail pages
  * [x] make clicks from "connections" go to detail page
* [x] Weekend tweaks
  * [x] Make entries on Bookmarks page sorted by start time of event
  * [x] Add Bookmarks filter to "Next" i.e. can show only what is bookmarked
  * [x] Add a breakdown of events by room (a "Room" page)
  * [x] Link to room page from events
  * [x] Add bookmarks filter to room page
  * [x] Bring schedule up to date and reindex 
* [ ] design/other tweaks (just a holding ground as I see things)
  * [x] fix sojourner links (seems to be using `guid` instead of `id` now identifier in URL) 
  * [ ] add ability to find related events to `InMemoryOpenAIQueryable`
  * [ ] switch bookmarks css to use [nested css](https://web.dev/articles/5-css-snippets-every-front-end-developer-should-know-in-2024)
  * [ ] remove / refactor `current_event` as seems to be hanging around where not needed
  * [ ] use RoomId instead of String in Event
  * [x] make all `details` elements by default closed, and open via JS if on larger screen
