title: Bookmarked Video Player + Data Update

Added an initial version of a video player on the [Bookmarks](/bookmarks) page which finds all events you've bookmarked that have videos and pulls them together into a simple player. Note that I tried to a version of this which used `.webm` video files rather than `.mp4`, as they are smaller, but that version was refusing to play on Safari.

Also updated event data.
