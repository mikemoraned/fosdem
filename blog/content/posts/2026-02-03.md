### Replace "Now and Next" with "Timetable"

For me, attending FOSDEM is a mix between:
* rushing between a chain of hard-to-miss talks in different places
* planning to attend a run of talks clustered in the same place
* tactically giving-up on either of the above

The "Now and Next" feature didn't do any of these well, or sometimes at all. The [Timetable view](/2026/timetable/) is not perfect but it [does them better](https://www.houseofmoran.com/post/2026-02-01/).

### Retiring "Connections"

When I first added the ability to find related content, this information only surfaced as links between events (nodes) in a [D3](https://d3js.org) [force-directed graph](https://d3js.org/d3-force). This was good at finding connections, but once I added the "Related" section to events in Search, it served a similar purpose, and was substantially simpler.

### Updated event data.

The main change you see here from [yesterday](/blog/2026-02-02/) is an increase in videos. I think this is partly due to them being uploaded so quickly (impressive!) but also because I fixed a bug in identifying video links.

| Year | Events | People | Rooms | Tracks | Videos | Slides | Links |

| 2024 | 874 | 948 | 29 | 65 | 842 (~361h) | 593 | 5217 |
| 2025 | 1105 | 1193 | 35 | 78 | 954 (~390h) | 758 | 7142 |
