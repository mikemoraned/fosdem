    "abstract": "<p>What was your first programming language? For some, it might have been <em>Logo</em>; for others, <em>Scratch</em>. Regardless of the language, many of us have fond memories of creating playful, creative programs as kids - not because we <em>had</em> to, but because it was <em>fun</em>.</p>\n<p>What many don’t realize is that the joy of these early experiences wasn’t by chance. It stems from the pioneering work of Seymour Papert, Cynthia Solomon, and others at the MIT Logo Lab in the late 1960s. They developed an educational philosophy called <em>constructionism</em> - the belief that children learn best when engaged in creative projects that connect with their personal interests. This philosophy shaped not only <em>Logo</em> but an entire lineage of educational programming tools designed to make coding fun, expressive, and meaningful.</p>\n<p>Today, as the \"Learn to Code\" movement is challenged by generative AI, researchers and educators are revisiting these roots. They view programming not merely as a utilitarian skill for the job market but as a medium for exploration and creative expression. From analyzing complex data to creating art and understanding systems, programming can be much more than a language to be learned - it can be a language <em>for</em> learning.</p>\n<p>For education, free and open-source software is a cornerstone. Free software ensures that tools remain accessible to all, fosters collaboration, and empowers learners to not only use but also understand and modify the systems they engage with - crucial for digital sovereignty.</p>\n<p>In this talk, we’ll take you on a whirlwind tour of some of the most influential programming languages designed for children, from <em><a href=\"https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bh/logo.html\">Logo</a></em>, <em><a href=\"https://github.com/codefrau/SqueakJS\">Smalltalk</a></em>, and <em><a href=\"https://squeak.org\">Etoys</a></em> to <em><a href=\"https://github.com/scratchfoundation\">Scratch</a></em> and their modern descendants like <em><a href=\"https://snap.berkeley.edu\">Snap!</a></em> and <em><a href=\"https://microblocks.fun\">MicroBlocks</a></em>. Rather than just describing these languages, we’ll <em>show</em> you their power through live demos.</p>",

The\noriginal talk mostly focussed on how to deal with corporations, which\ntend to act rationally and are usually persuadable.  In this talk I'd\nlike to look at individuals and their motivations and how their\nselfish motivations can be harnessed efficiently.</p>\n<p>By now everyone has heard the phrase \"toxic individualism\" which\nsimply means putting your rights and needs over that of the community.\nMany Codes of Conduct try to characterize this behaviour and that, in\nturn, can lead to a general fear because many actions of a selfish\ncontributor could be classified as toxic behaviour because under this\ndefinition, every non-altruistic action (even scratching your own\nitch) could fit the definition.  One would think therefore that\nsuccessful and vibrant communities must be tolerant of some form toxic\nbehaviour to avoid driving away potential contributions, but that\nisn't true either.  What actually happens is that successful\ncommunities evolve strategies for harnessing what would otherwise\nbecome toxic behaviours to serve the community.</p>\n<p>This talk will explore how conditions arise in a community for\nharnessing selfish impulses to the good of the community.  Sometimes\nit can be community processes, but most often it is people who spot\nthe issue and help mediate a solution which benefits both the\ncontributor and the community at large.  This talk will also explore\nwhat those skills are and how to develop them and also touch on how,\neven in the best communities, those mechanisms can fail and give some\nhints for recognizing when this has happened and what to do about it.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Many popular free and open source projects are owned and driven by corporations, and in today's difficult economic climate, those companies are under increasing pressure to protect their businesses or show stronger returns for investors. One response to this pressure has been the relicensing of popular open source projects to more restrictive licenses like what we’ve seen with MongoDB, Elasticsearch, HashiCorp’s Terraform / Vault, and Redis to name just a few. These companies are putting their projects under non-open source licenses, despite there not being consistent evidence that this actually generates improved financial outcomes for those companies.</p>\n<p>In some cases, this relicensing has resulted in a hard fork of the original project. Both the relicensing and the resulting fork create turmoil for the users of that project and the community of contributors. In this panel, we’ll discuss the following topics: dynamics around relicensing that results in such hard forks; examples of forks along with the impact on the communities; and thoughts about what this means for the future of free and open source software. The audience will gain an appreciation of why relicensing results in hostile forks and how to think about this issue when selecting projects for contribution or usage.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Software code is not just content—it’s the foundation of critical digital infrastructure, and its unique functional purpose demands a specialized approach to platform governance. Unlike other digital media, code is widely duplicated, remixed, and shared under open source licensing terms, presenting distinct considerations for copyright and moderation. Additionally, the dual-use nature of software, such as security research projects, introduces complex challenges: tools designed to identify vulnerabilities can also be exploited for malicious purposes. Moderating a code collaboration platform requires careful consideration of open source software’s function as critical digital infrastructure and the network effects of takedowns. Likewise, code collaboration platforms must reflect the free and open source developer community’s values of collaboration and transparency, while empowering maintainers to support the health of their projects. </p>\n<p>In this presentation, authors of the recently published article “Nuances and Challenges of Moderating a Code Collaboration Platform” in the Journal of Online Trust and Safety will discuss key takeaways. We’ll provide an under the hood look at how GitHub has developed tools and policies tailored to the needs of the free and open source software developer community. This will include a diverse set of case studies, including how we’ve responded to legal and policy challenges such as the EU Copyright Directive and US Digital Millennium Copyright Act, how we’ve evolved our approach to dual-use software over time, and how notable incidents such as the youtube-dl takedown and reinstatement have influenced our developer-first approach to content moderation. We will also touch on the importance of community content moderation and the tools we have developed for maintainers to establish expectations for conduct and contribution on their projects. Attendees will leave with an understanding of how the values of the free and open source developer community inform the governance of code collaboration platforms and how they can engage with platforms and policymakers.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>In recent years, it has been repeatedly shown that memory safety problems account for the vast majority of security vulnerabilities in software systems. In response, security researchers and government agencies alike have urged software developers to replace their use of C and C++ with memory-safe programming languages. Fortunately, there are several native programming languages to choose from, but there is a catch: you must rewrite your code to get these memory-safety benefits. In today's established software systems, that could mean rewriting hundreds of millions of lines of existing C and C++ code, which is beyond impractical.</p>\n<p>To move memory safety forward in an established software system, we propose an incremental approach comprised of three parts. First, use of a memory-safe language (in our case, <a href=\"https://github.com/swiftlang/swift/\">Swift</a>) for new code or for targeted rewrites. Second, memory-safety improvements to C and C++ that can be applied to large swathes of existing code. Finally, deep interoperability between the memory-safe language and existing C and C++ without sacrificing memory safety. This talk will explore all three aspects of this approach in the context of Swift, and will reflect on lessons learned for both programming language design and rollout in an established software system.</p>",

Why are developers joining and contributing to it? </p>\n<p>When the project launched in 2016, there was the commitment from the start apply known best practices to its development.  While Zephyr is a different code base, a lot of the lessons learned from the Linux Kernel Community were applied to forming it's community.  The project focused on incorporating security best practices as the were identified right from the start,  and is now working towards formal safety certification.</p>\n<p>This talk will go through some of the best practices that have been applied for developing open source projects, and illustrate the results of applying these best practices.</p>",

However, this makes emission of CFI directives much more complicated.\nI am currently in the process of upstreaming this work. The proof-of-concept branch is publicly\navailable here: https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/90819 I have only tried this approach\non RISCV, but it could be applied to other targets as well.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>The Ryzen AI NPUs consist of an array of vector processors and programmable interconnect to allow granular control of compute and data movement to achieve high performance and power efficiency. This talk presents a MLIR-based data tiling and packing design for these NPUs that leads to optimized machine instructions. Specifically, it shows how we can derive and optimize how data flows through the array from high-level tiling decisions and how we can efficiently utilize a high degree of data packing by leveraging low-level DMA control and capabilities.</p>",

However, the diversity of these technologies can be confusing, particularly for new maintainers. I personally found it challenging to understand. The introduction of the new CI/CD admin role and the discussions in the RFC are promising developments that should help clarify these complexities.</p>\n<p>AMD ROCm™ is based on the LLVM project, which is why AMD is deeply invested in supporting its development. This includes providing resources to test the AMDGPU code generation backend and various GPU offloading programming models. Consequently, AMD maintains a range of upstream buildbots for this purpose.</p>\n<p>In this presentation, I discuss the motivation and objectives behind the AMD ROCm™ compiler buildbots and related initiatives. I share my two-year journey, which began with inheriting a single buildbot, then another, and eventually maintaining multiple machines and bot configurations. I delve into the technical challenges I encountered and the solutions I implemented. I also touch on non-technical issues from my perspective and how they were resolved by both me and the community. The presentation concludes with a forward-looking perspective on potential additions to the upstream test infrastructure to address existing blind spots from our point of view.</p>",

During my work on the <a href=\"https://github.com/zamazan4ik/awesome-pgo\">Awesome PGO</a> project, I gathered a lot of interesting data points and insights about current PGO issues in the ecosystem (mostly with LLVM-based tools since I prefer using LLVM), and discussed many issues with different stakeholders like end-users, maintainers, and application developers. We will talk about:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>PGO documentation issues across compilers</li>\n<li>Different PGO integration states across LLVM-based compilers</li>\n<li>PGO awareness across the industry</li>\n<li>Strengths and weaknesses of different PGO modes for different use cases in real-world</li>\n<li>Top blockers for PGO adoption</li>\n<li>And many other things!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I believe that after the talk more people will be aware of PGO, aware of usual PGO blockers with LLVM, and know more about how to avoid these limitations in practice.</p>\n<p>Target audience: LLVM users (especially LLVM-based compiler engineers and LLVM adopters)</p>",

We used this to add errors when using file descriptors that can be reported by any valgrind tool by using --track-fds=yes. This allows reporting on bad use of file descriptors, file descriptors that are double closed, used after closing, and file descriptors that \"leak\".

While traditional bitwise implementations are slow and less efficient, alternative methods such as lookup tables, carry-less multiplication, and hardware CRC instructions offer significant performance improvements. In this talk, I will present a novel method for automatically identifying and replacing inefficient bitwise CRC implementations with optimized alternatives. The approach uses fast detection of candidate code fragments, symbolic execution for validation, and automatic replacement with more efficient implementations.  The method is implemented in the GCC compiler as a separate pass and is open-source available. Experimental evaluation was performed for i386, AArch64, and RISC-V architectures, and the results demonstrated up to 91%, 98%, and 93% performance improvements respectively, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed optimization.</p>",

The movement of data through different storage classes can be achieved using S3 lifecycle rules based on the age of the files. Intelligent tiering for RGW (Rados Gateway) is a feature in Ceph storage that automatically moves data between storage tiers based on policies. This feature optimises storage costs and performance by moving frequently accessed data to faster storage tiers and less frequently accessed data to lower-cost, higher-capacity tiers. The intelligent tiering policy is customizable, allowing users to define criteria for data migration, such as access frequency, time, and size. This feature is particularly useful for large-scale object storage deployments, where optimizing storage costs and performance is crucial. The first step is to extend the existing cloud transition to include features like read-through, restore API(like glacier in s3 protocol)</p>",

Notable changes are improvements to present special files like sockets and FIFO files to clients. There has been improvements to better support operations like chmod and chown in the Linux client and the Samba server.</p>\n<p>The biggest change on the Samba side has been an overhaul of handling native symlinks.

It is a complete and independent software defined storage solution, handling internally all aspects related to capacity management, performance, fault-tolerance, as well as interfacing with both Kubernetes and the end user. Longhorn is an actively-developed and mature software, however our installations have revealed that it currently lacks the ability to take advantage of the hardware performance available in local servers that feature high-speed solid state disks and high-bandwidth network connectivity. This presentation investigates a series of performance optimizations that have been engineered in the Longhorn's core that collectively allow the system to achieve an order of magnitude better IOPS and bandwidth.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Like most POSIX file systems, CephFS has always been a case-sensitive file\nsystem. However, it has become a priority to improve integration with gateways\nlike Samba which present a case-insensitive view of some tree in the file\nsystem. In order to present that view, Samba requires expensive checks for file\nname lookups to locate a directory entry with the computed case-insensitive\nfolding. It is also necessary to politely handle interoperating with other \nclients that are using normal case-sensitive names. To address this gap, CephFS\nnow provides a mechanism for enforcing case-insensitive operations on a\ndirectory tree for all clients by simply setting a Ceph extended attribute.\nThis talk will walk through the challenges for Samba's gateway on CephFS, the\nchanges to the CephFS metadata server and clients, the interfaces used by other\nwell-known file systems, and the expectations users may have going forward.</p>",

This \"Single Sign-On\" approach allows for the use of a unified identity verification source across the entire information system, and is now being extended to VoIP.\nIn this conference, we will explore how OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect are integrated into a modern SIP environment, with a focus on managing and validating access tokens. To illustrate this, we will use our Flexisip server solution.</p>\n<p>Key Topics:\n- OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect: Introduction and benefits for authentication in modern SIP systems.\n- JWT for Authentication: Token signature validation and extracting user identity.\n- Integration in Flexisip: Demonstration of OAuth-based authentication with Flexisip, and token validation in a SIP environment.\n- Authorization Management: Controlling requests based on identity information extracted from access tokens.</p>\n<p>This conference will provide an overview of how to implement and secure user authentication with OAuth 2.0 and JWT in a SIP server, using Flexisip as a concrete example.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Until a few months ago, the only working approach for connecting realtime AI agents to WebRTC streams and phone calls was to use lengthy pipelines of speech to text, agent orchestration, and text to speech, often using multiple machine learning models from commercial vendors.\nThat has changed with new realtime speech to speech models, most famously the (closed) OpenAI advanced voice, but what are the open source ways to build these kind of systems?\nThis talk walks through my experience with using 4 different projects to build functional systems which can use open source (open weights) models at their core. We will talk about how we have integrated Jambonz, Livekit, and Ultravox (Fixie.AI) within our Aplisay framework and what this allows us to do.</p>",

I hope this presentation demystifies some of the tooling we use and inspires others to think bigger about how to write documents and how to improve accessibility.</p>\n<p>I will talk about our Org export process, working with multiple src-block languages, and integrating Emacs with GNU Make.

In this talk, you’ll get a preview of a new open-source resource for maintainers to help recognize archetypal documentation projects, the skills you’ll need to successfully complete them, and common pitfalls to avoid. And across documentation projects—whether you’re adopting new docs tools, rewriting tutorials, or deleting out-of-date materials—you’ll learn some important themes that will lead maintainers and tech writers to make the docs that users and developers want.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><a href=\"https://ddbeck.com/\">Daniel D.

It’s loved for its rich features and its ability to modularize and reuse content. The AsciiDoc Working Group at the Eclipse Foundation has recently published the AsciiDoc Language documentation, and it is continuing to work on the AsciiDoc Language Specification that is the foundation to define standard parsing rules for the language.\nThis talk showcases different AsciiDoc tools in real-world project documentation pipelines to show what is possible today when you author, verify, convert, and publish content.

To achieve this, we aimed to minimize the time spent maintaining our docs while ensuring they stay perfectly in sync with the code. So we developed custom AST parsing code that automatically converts code into a structured data format.\nWe then use a GoHugo templating system to publish it in a polished and user-friendly way.</p>\n<p>All of this code is open source, making it available for others to use and benefit from! We'll also show how even a small project could do this.</p>\n<p>I'll deliver live demos throughout, ensuring the concepts come to life.</p>\n<p>You'll also get a glimpse of how <code>mgmt</code> can revolutionize your workflows-- it might just become your go-to tool for managing documentation pipelines!</p>\n<p>For those who want a head start, check out our <a href=\"https://purpleidea.com/tags/mgmtconfig/\">blog posts</a>.

    "abstract": "<p>We present bpftrace [1], a tracing tool for Linux based on eBPF which comes with a simple domain-specific language, \"bpfscript\". The language offers a convenient way to write eBPF tracing programs, without the need to dive deep into the complexities of eBPF. This makes bpftrace suitable as the entry point into the eBPF world. In addition, the terse nature of the language facilitates on-the-fly writing of very powerful short programs (so-called \"one-liners\") specifically tailored at the user's immediate tracing purposes.</p>\n<p>Where bpftrace has struggled in the past, is writing complex tools which are intended to run and be maintained for a prolonged period of time. This has recently started to change with the introduction of many new bpfscript features such as variable and type declarations, user-defined functions, and more.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, our goal is to make bpftrace the number one choice for most tracing tasks on Linux. In this talk, I will guide you through our way to achieve that - the current state of the project, the latest significant additions, and the planned future work.</p>\n<p>No prior knowledge of eBPF or bpftrace is required for this talk.

However, gathering telemetry from these workloads to optimise performance is challenging because it requires manual instrumentation and adds performance overheads. Further, it does not produce telemetry in a standardised format for commonly used visualisation tools like Prometheus.</p>\n<p>This talk explores the potential of leveraging eBPF to capture CUDA calls made to GPUs, including kernel launches and memory allocations. Data from these probes can be used to export Prometheus metrics, facilitating detailed analysis of kernel launch patterns and associated memory usage. This approach offers significant benefits as eBPF imposes minimal overhead and requires no intrusive instrumentation. Our implementation is also open-source and available on GitHub.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions continuously monitor the events occurring on an endpoint, create detailed process timelines, and analyse these data, to reveal suspicious patterns that could indicate threats such as ransomware. To create these detailed timelines, EDR solutions collect a variety of information about each process running on the endpoint, such as timestamp, PID, process name, path, command line, etc. On Linux systems, this is often done using the proc filesystem provided by the operating system, which provides rich information for each process currently running on the system.\nHowever, if a process is short-lived and exits quickly, the proc filesystem entries for it get cleared out before the EDR solution can read them, leading to incomplete timelines. To take a simple example, suppose a malicious actor runs a script that downloads a binary from the network and then executes it. This downloaded binary quickly spawns a bunch of long-running malicious processes and exits itself. If EDR solution is unable to extract the complete process information about the execution of the downloaded binary from proc filesystem (being a short-lived process), it'll miss details about the creator of the malicious process in the system. Hence, EDR solution will have visibility gaps about the downloaded binary required for Security Threat Analysis. \nWe propose a solution to address the gaps by attaching extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) programs dynamically to the Linux kernel system calls (such as fork, exec and exit) and extracting all the required information directly from the kernel hooks using BPF Type Format (BTF). These hooks use fundamental task structure in kernel representing a process or thread to extract variety of information about the process. Our proof of concept shows that eBPF-based process data extraction provides process timelines with near 100% reliability, compared to proc filesystem-based approaches which have a reliability of only around 83% for short lived processes.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Integrated in the Linux kernel since 2014, eBPF has allowed the creation of a large variety of projects (observability, security, network, etc.). Unlike kernel modules, eBPF programs can be loaded by unprivileged users. The Linux kernel is protected by a static analyzer, called the <a href=\"https://docs.kernel.org/bpf/verifier.html\">eBPF verifier</a>, which verifies that eBPF programs cannot harm the kernel and respect required security properties. Recently, several research works have shown that the eBPF verifier, which is a critical component, is not sound. This means that programs which should be rejected are accepted by the verifier, allowing unprivileged users to run malicious programs (e.g [<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-37709-9_12\">1</a>,<a href=\"https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity24/presentation/jin-di\">2</a>,<a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3627703.3629562\">3</a>,<a href=\"https://www.usenix.org/conference/osdi24/presentation/sun-hao\">4</a>,<a href=\"https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity24/presentation/lu-hongyi\">5</a>]). In this talk, we propose to evaluate the performance of the eBPF verifier through the measurement of three main aspects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Performance evaluation: to understand the evolution of the eBPF verifier versions, we evaluated the verification time and consumed memory of six eBPF verifier versions (Linux kernel 5.0 to 6.8, both included). The results show that for some eBPF programs, the verifiers have nearly the same verification times (except for the conditional jumps, where the verification time has decreased since the introduction of the bounded loops in the Linux kernel 5.3). Consumed memory remains also stable.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Comparative evaluation with <a href=\"https://vbpf.github.io/\">PREVAIL</a>: as the eBPF verifier is not sound, we compared it to PREVAIL, which is another verifier proposed in 2019 at the PLDI conference. PREVAIL is a sound verifier that runs in user space and is used in the eBPF infrastructure of Windows. On the one hand, we were interested in the implementation differences between the two verification solutions and on the other hand, we observed the performance difference between the two verifiers. We observed that, although PREVAIL's performance has improved, it remains less efficient than the eBPF verifier. Nevertheless, PREVAIL showed that it can efficiently verify programs containing a lot of paths (implied by conditional jumps) thanks to the join operator and the fixpoint computation used for the bounded loops, where the eBPF verifier would have created a lot of paths, trying to reduce them with pruning.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Impact of compilers: beyond the verification mechanisms, there are external constraints such as the compilers: An eBPF program is first compiled into eBPF bytecode and then analyzed. However, we observed that for the eBPF verifier with a specific eBPF program, which varies only by its number of loop iterations, Clang-8 produced more programs accepted by the eBPF verifier and these programs are verified faster than those produced by Clang-14.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

    "abstract": "<p>The eBPF verifier has repeatedly suffered from bugs in its verification\nalgorithm which enable malicious applications to perform container escapes and\nprivilege escalation. To improve upon this, existing work applies fuzzing (<a href=\"https://lpc.events/event/18/contributions/1933/\">Chaignon'24</a>)\nand formal methods (<a href=\"https://lpc.events/event/18/contributions/1937/\">Agni</a>) to the verifier in order to find and fix bugs. However,\nin the mid-term, these approaches are unlikely to result in a verifier that is\nfully bug-free. While academic works have proposed the use of hardware-based\nisolation (<a href=\"https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity24/presentation/lu-hongyi\">MOAT</a>, <a href=\"https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity24/presentation/zhang-peihua\">Hive</a>, <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3689938.3694781\">SafeBPF</a>) and software-fault isolation (<a href=\"https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity24/presentation/jin-di\">BeeBox</a>) to mitigate verifier bugs,\nthese approaches suffer from portability issues, require significant\ndesign-changes with unclear consequences, or have runtime overheads.</p>\n<p>Motivated by the shortcomings of the existing approaches, this talk discusses an\nalternative approach to prevent verifier-bugs from being exploited. By requiring\neBPF bytecode to be compiled from <em>safe</em> Rust source code by a trusted systems\nservice, program-safety would effectively be checked twice by two very different\nstatic analyzers (i.e., rustc's compiler passes and the eBPF verifier). Therefore, a bug in one of\nthe analyzers will no longer directly result in a kernel exploit as the other\nanalyzer is unlikely to exhibit the same buggy behavior and therefore still\ncatch malicious programs. This approach is appealing as it is unlikely to result in runtime\noverheads and does not require significant changes to the kernel.</p>\n<p>We analyze whether this is a viable approach to mitigate bugs in the eBPF\nverifier, taking runtime-overheads, expressiveness, and security into\nconsideration. Specifically, we analyze whether past bugs in rustc and the eBPF\nverifier could have been chained together in order to exploit the proposed\ndesign as a whole.</p>\n<p>We find that the fundamental flexibility of the Rust-IR-to-eBPF mapping allows attackers to still exploit the system as a whole. We also investigate whether using the alternative PREVAIL eBPF verifier would prevent a similar attack, but find that there exists a simple construction that allows attackers to combine exploits for the individual verifiers into an exploit that works for the verifiers when chained together.</p>",

Private data holds immense value not only for businesses but also for critical research domains like public health, economics, social sciences, and civic engagement. However, leveraging such data for analytics comes with significant privacy risks. ManaTEE aims to address these challenges by integrating a set of Privacy Enhancing Techniques (PETs), including confidential computing, to safeguard data privacy without compromising usability. The framework provides an interactive interface through JupyterLab, ensuring an intuitive experience for researchers and data scientists. We will showcase how Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) ensure both data confidentiality and execution integrity, fostering trust between data owners and analysts. Furthermore, we will highlight how confidential computing can offer additional properties such as proof of execution, enabling researchers to demonstrate the reproducibility and integrity of their results through attestation. Finally, we discuss how ManaTEE simplifies deployment across various confidential computing backends, making secure and private data analytics both accessible and scalable for diverse use cases.</p>",

Originally designed for AMD SEV-SNP, Coconut SVSM is evolving into a multi-platform solution, with ongoing efforts to integrate support for Intel TDX Partitioning.</p>\n<p>This talk will dive into the current progress of Coconut SVSM, focusing on the emulation of devices such as the virtual Trusted Platform Module (vTPM), based on the reference implementation from the Trusted Computing Group (TCG). At this stage, the vTPM in Coconut SVSM is ephemeral, being re-manufactured with each boot. To unlock broader use cases, the community is working on introducing a persistent state for SVSM, enabling the vTPM to preserve its state across reboots. This enhancement will also allows us to support UEFI variable store to support Secure Boot.</p>\n<p>Achieving this persistence requires storing encrypted state securely on the untrusted host, with early boot-time attestation to decrypt and validate the state. This process raises several technical challenges that we are actively tackling.</p>\n<p>Join us to explore the latest progress in Coconut SVSM, the challenges we’ve overcome, and the exciting opportunities still ahead.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Securing embedded devices, particularly those with minimal resources, presents a unique and pressing challenge. Conventional approaches to Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) often require specialized hardware or substantial system resources, leaving low-end devices vulnerable to breaches. The need for a lightweight, efficient solution that bridges this gap is greater than ever in today’s interconnected world.  </p>\n<h2>Introducing Spock</h2>\n<p>Through the development of Spock, we have created a versatile and efficient Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) tailored for RISC-V embedded devices. By relying solely on Physical Memory Protection (PMP) for isolation and requiring only machine and user modes as specified in the RISC-V privileged instruction set, Spock delivers robust security without relying on any specialized hardware.  </p>\n<p>At the core of Spock’s architecture is the <strong>Security Manager (SM)</strong>, which plays a key role in managing enclave data and buffer permissions. The SM enables Spock to efficiently virtualize buffers and dynamically allocate PMP entries, providing a flexible and scalable approach to memory isolation. By leveraging this abstraction, Spock can create virtual enclaves that surpass hardware-imposed limitations, such as the number of PMP entries.  </p>\n<h2>Core Features and Capabilities</h2>\n<p>Spock’s minimalist API design delivers essential security functions, including secure execution and attestation. This design supports:  </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Virtualization of critical operations while maintaining a minimal Trusted Computing Base (TCB).  </li>\n<li>Integration into very low resource embedded devices. </li>\n<li>Both relocatable and fixed enclaves, offering flexibility for diverse use cases.  </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Why Spock Matters</h2>\n<p>Spock’s design represents a modern, efficient solution for secure computing in low-resource embedded devices. Its ability to combine robust security with minimal hardware requirements makes it uniquely suited for the demands of today’s connected world, ensuring that even the smallest devices can operate securely.</p>\n<p>Available at : https://github.com/jiphelsen/Spock</p>",

I’ll start off by talking about some of the design decisions that went into building the <a href=\"https://github.com/apple/swift-distributed-tracing\">swift-distributed-tracing</a> library, which I co-created as part of Google Summer of Code in 2020. The talk will not only compare it to other Swift observability libraries (<a href=\"https://github.com/apple/swift-log\">swift-log</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/apple/swift-metrics\">swift-metrics</a>), but also highlight some of the differences between Distributed Tracing in Swift compared to other ecosystems. My personal highlight is the fact that we eliminated the need for support libraries such as “OTel instrumentation for this specific web framework” by implementing swift-distributed-tracing to be used by libraries directly.\nDuring the next part, I’ll cover what it means to build a tracer implementation for swift-distributed-tracing with plenty of examples from my OpenTelemetry client <a href=\"https://github.com/slashmo/swift-otel\">swift-otel</a>. I’ll finish the talk with an end-to-end example of a server-side Swift application using the <a href=\"https://github.com/hummingbird-project/hummingbird\">Hummingbird</a> web framework, fully instrumented using Logging, Metrics, and Distributed Tracing, including context propagation and log correlation. This example exports logs, metrics, and spans via the OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) to both a standalone OTel Collector instance and other observability backends that support OTLP natively.</p>\n<p>Links:\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/apple/swift-distributed-tracing\">GitHub: apple/swift-distributed-tracing</a>\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/swift-otel/swift-otel\">GitHub: slashmo/swift-otel</a>\n- <a href=\"https://opentelemetry.io\">OpenTelemetry Website</a></p>",

While privacy is a top concern for many individuals and businesses, the complexities of self-hosting a mail server often outweigh the benefits, leading many to choose to sacrifice some privacy and pay a third-party provider to manage their email instead. One of the key challenges of self-hosting an email server is the outdated and complex nature of most available open-source mail server software.</p>\n<p>Stalwart Mail Server seeks to change this by providing a modern, open-source mail server built in Rust that prioritizes ease of use, security, and privacy. Designed to simplify self-hosting, Stalwart Mail Server enables individuals and businesses to reclaim their email autonomy with confidence. This talk will explore how Stalwart Mail Server democratizes email, promoting decentralization by making self-hosted email accessible, secure, and efficient. Join us to learn how Stalwart can empower you to take back control of your email in today’s digital landscape.</p>",

It is a major improvement over self-monitoring your MTA service, because it creates - in contrast to self-monitoring - a <strong>world-wide view</strong> how others „see“ your platform. It allows e.g. to make areas in the network visible, where TLS fails, to investigate and ideally to fix the problem in order to keep communication secure.</p>\n<p>Previously the capability to create and send TLSRPT reports had been limited to a few major platforms running their own or a commercial MTA. This will change early 2025. The Postfix MTA will be the first Open Source MTA to <a href=\"https://www.postfix.org/TLSRPT_README.html\">implement functionality</a> that permits to send TLSRPT-relevant DATA to a TLSRPT report service. The service will collect the DATA, create a report and pass it on to an MTA for delivery or submit it directly via HTTP.</p>\n<p>Postfix’ new feature is the result of a collaborative effort between Wietse Venema, the creator of Postfix, and my company sys4 as we want to foster TLSRPT (also because it hinders German providers to qualify to become BSI approved „Secure E-Mail Platforms“).</p>\n<p>We created an Open Source low-level C-library that can be used by any MTA - not only Postfix - and the service required to create TLSRPT reports. Both can be downloaded at <a href=\"https://github.com/sys4/tlsrpt/\">github</a>. And we hope many other Open Source projects will use the library and the service to implement TLSRPT reporting in their MTA.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>In recent years DMARC has become one of the cornerstones of email deliverability. A large part of email is now protected by the combined efforts of SPF, DKIM and DMARC checks. However, the secret weapons of DMARC which are hardly used are its reports. Along with respecting the policy set by an email sender, the recipient also actively acknowledges how many emails have been sent, from which IP addresses and why some of them have been delivered and others not. This reporting is done by providing a xml file inside a zip attached to an email, which makes it rather hard to digest for humans. Imagine what happens if you get such a report every day for every internet domain you, all of your colleagues and anybody spoofing you send emails to...</p>\n<p>Obviously this calls for a tool. Interestingly, even though DMARC is almost a decade old, no good FOSS tool was ever developed. This is why DMARCaroni was created: free and open source software (written in Haskell and Elm) to deliver all your DMARC monitoring needs. In this talk I will unveil this new tool which I wrote in the last 18 months, show off its features, and talk about the roadmap.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Over the years, Delta Chat has matured to be an easy-to-use, secure, and even fast messenger for all platforms, based on the massive e-mail server network. We'll give an overview of the ways Delta Chat is used today and how it is developed by a dozen active contributors. This talk will highlight our recent introduction of realtime chat-shared apps that use e-mail OpenPGP-encrypted messaging to establish a private Peer-to-Peer network among chat group members. In this talk we will demonstrate how these apps work in real-time. We'll also report on several interesting situations where Delta Chat is used today in context of partial shutdowns or strict internet censorship.</p>\n<p>Description:</p>\n<p>In the beginning, Delta Chat was a fun little experiment, an experimental solution to the network effects problem: “nobody uses secure messengers! But everyone has E-Mail… 🤔\" Since then it has come a long way. From a cross-platform set of messenger apps with freely chosen e-mail servers to using audited and well analyzed end-to-end encryption, our project is based on IETF and W3C approved protocols and specifications. We interoperate with the massively distributed SMTP e-mail routing network as well as other e-mail based apps or webmailers and socially are in collaborative relations with numerous other projects, including XMPP-based messengers and standardization specialists.</p>\n<p>Delta Chat was among the first messengers to adopt Rust (2019) as its core implementation language and provide all-platform apps. Together with XMPP-projects like Cheogram and Monocles we are evolving a new paradigm and quasi-standard called \"webxdc\" that enables integration of web apps into chat groups, giving users full control over app distribution. Webxdcs provide a unique Peer-to-Peer model for deploying collaborative standards based software.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>The software industry traditionally used the right to exclude granted by copyright as the means for generating revenue. Free software came along and flipped the script, giving away for free what traditionally was the primary mechanism for extracting payment. But free software has struggled ever since, trying to figure out how to create value that customers are willing to pay for when they can’t use the copyright that way.</p>\n<p>More and more, companies are recognizing and leveraging the truly unique asset in free software – the brand. Ketchup is a commodity market, but Heinz has captured 80% of it by convincing U.S. consumers that Heinz ketchup is better than all the rest. Open source software is similar to a commodity market because the original software may be competing with the identical product. Open source software companies are learning how to develop business models around the brand, convincing customers that the customer will be better served by remaining loyal to the branded product instead of their competitors who are simply copying and distributing the software.</p>\n<p>But it’s also possible for companies to overextend their trademark rights to subvert the promise given in the copyright license. Frustrated at free-riding or the perception of it, companies are now also trying to extract revenue through questionable trademark infringement theories.</p>\n<p>This session will review the current state of trademark thinking in free software as a revenue strategy, both the appropriate and inappropriate ways to manage the customer relationship through the brand.</p>\n<p>*Robert Young, How Red Hat Software Stumbled Across a New Economic Model and Helped Improve and Industry, Open Sources, Voices from the Revolution p. 116 (1999).</p>",

At the end of the lawsuit, complete source code for all LGPL works had been made available, which means everything needed to reinstall changes, for the FRITZ!Box 4020.  This marks the first time to our knowledge in Germany that an individual purchaser has successfully sued a manufacturer and received complete source code as a result.  This talk will describe what the case was about, what the compliance issues were before the lawsuit, and how \"the scripts used to control compilation and installation\" that AVM provided over the course of the lawsuit brought them into compliance with LGPLv2.1.</p>",

It is hard, and some lawyers think it's even impossible, for a DCO to allow FSF to enforce the GPL. However, we at the FSF have once promised to accept DCOs and to draft a DCO that would best serve the needs of the free software community.

Can trained weights themselves be considered source code? \n- What does user freedom (and in particular, freedom to study and modify) mean in the context of AI models?  How, if at all, does it differ from our traditional understanding of software freedom?\n- Are there any reasons to tolerate use restrictions in AI model licenses that we would reject for FOSS?\n- Proposed normative definitions of free/open AI and related efforts, including the OSI’s OSAID 1.0, FSF’s criteria for free machine learning applications, and the Model Openness Framework\n- Should we have different tiers of free-ness/openness when assessing AI models/systems?\n- Leaving aside the question of source code, are there other kinds of artifacts that should be released with a model for it to legitimately be considered free/open?</p>",

This innovative system combines advanced hardware and software to meet the challenges of CubeSat missions while promoting accessibility and flexibility through an open ecosystem.</p>\n<p>The subsystem features an STM32H743 microcontroller as its main processor, complemented by a ZYNQ-7020 FPGA accelerator for computationally intensive tasks. SATNOGS-COMMS is built on Zephyr RTOS, with the firmware written entirely in C++17. Notably, its hardware control interfaces follow a platform-agnostic architecture, enabling users to adapt the firmware to their preferred RTOS with minimal effort.</p>\n<p>This presentation will delve into the software engineering decisions, challenges encountered, and the advantages of an open-source approach for CubeSat missions and space exploration. Key topics include:\n  * The benefits of using C++ in embedded systems, particularly in the context of resource constraints.\n  *  How the use of exceptions improves firmware safety and reliability.\n  * Fault-tolerant mechanisms designed to ensure reliable operation in the harsh environment of space.\nAdditionally, we will highlight our approach to enabling user-defined code integration without modifying the original codebase, comparing it with other commercial and non-commercial solutions.</p>\n<p>The complete project, including hardware designs, software, simulations, and documentation, is freely available at the project’s GitLab repository: https://gitlab.com/librespacefoundation/satnogs-comms.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Regular software updates are essential for fixing common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs), addressing bugs, and adding new features, all while maintaining security and increasing the lifespan of embedded Linux devices. Over the past decade, the landscape has changed significantly, with many high-quality and reliable open source solutions now available, making the development of in-house update solutions unnecessary. During this time, several SOTA solutions using different strategies have come and gone. Open source options based on the dual A/B redundant update scheme have become widely adopted in the industry. This session will focus on three such solutions: Mender, RAUC, and swupdate. We will analyze their strengths and weaknesses, offering guidance on selecting the best solution for different use cases and industries. Additionally, we will explore advanced features such as HTTP streaming, which allows direct installation of updates without the need to download and store the update file locally. We will also discuss the potential of adaptive and delta updates, which are additional features built on top of A/B update schemes. These features minimize data transfer by sending only the changes, rather than the full update files.</p>\n<p>The hands-on examples will demonstrate the integration of three different open source solutions: Mender, RAUC, and swupdate - on two different devices: Raspberry Pi 5 and the open source hardware Olimex I.MX8MP SoM, using the Yocto Project and OpenEmbedded. The demonstrations will highlight the differences in setup, configuration, and update management for each solution. Additionally, we will explore support for other build systems such as Buildroot, PTX dist, and distributions like Debia and Ubuntu, emphasizing how each solution integrates with these environments.</p>\n<p>This talk is suitable for engineers and developers looking to implement an open source update solution for embedded Linux devices. It will provide a deeper understanding of the technical challenges and available open source solutions, empowering attendees to address these challenges more effectively and focus on enhancing the unique features of their products.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>The Yocto Project offers the cve-check class to allow users to check\nfor known vulnerabilities in the packages they include in their\ndistribution. However, the CRA (Cyber Resilience Act) and changes\naround vulnerability databases require a different approach. The move\nto multiple databases and more dynamic vulnerability checking is in\nprogress.</p>\n<p>In this talk, we will explain the ongoing move to external checking\nfor vulnerabilities in the Yocto Project. This will allow users to\nverify their distribution years after the release without the original\nbuild directory.</p>\n<p>As the future of the NVD (National Vulnerability Database) is unknown,\nwe are also considering using other databases, starting with raw data\nfrom the CVE (Common Vulnerability Enumeration) program.</p>\n<p>The audience will also discover VEX (Vulnerability Exchange), allowing\nper-product annotations of vulnerabilities: you can finally say, \"Not\naffected, we disabled the vulnerable configuration option!\"</p>\n<p>This talk is 25 minutes; if we have 50, we can add more content and examples.</p>",

This talk explains how to start U-Boot before most of the blobs, thus giving it full unrestricted access to the platform, and how to start the blobs from U-Boot afterward, so Linux can still access the services like PSCI provided by the blobs.

Every so often, we uncover a breakthrough, enabling us to boost application performance up to ~70%.</p>\n<p>The graphics stack for the Raspberry Pi 4 and 5 is built on the <a href=\"https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa\">Mesa user-space drivers</a> (V3D/V3DV) and the <a href=\"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/\">Linux kernel driver</a> V3D. These drivers are fully mature, with the upstream Mesa Vulkan driver V3DV having already <a href=\"https://www.vulkan.org/news/auto-22842-c5c77c2da002ef993800251296a06bf3\">achieved Vulkan 1.3 conformance</a>, and the OpenGL/ES driver V3D exposing desktop OpenGL 3.1.</p>\n<p>However, just having working, conformant drivers isn't enough for us. In this talk, we will demonstrate how we go the extra mile to extract the maximum performance from the Raspberry Pi's GPU, proving that a more performant embedded GPU is possible.</p>\n<p>In addition to explaining where we currently stand, we will showcase several cases where optimizations in the Mesa user-space drivers led to significant performance improvements. We will also review recent developments in the kernel driver, including <a href=\"https://mairacanal.github.io/unleashing-power-enabling-super-pages-on-RPi/\">support for Huge Pages</a> in the GPU kernel driver and our experience using Transparent Huge Pages (THP) on an embedded device.</p>\n<p>By the end of this talk, we hope the audience will have a better understanding of the graphics stack for embedded GPUs and how to start getting more juice out of an embedded board.</p>",

Its alternative, the GPIO character device and the associated libgpiod project, has been available since 2017. The library, along with its numerous bindings, has become the de facto standard tool for interacting with GPIOs from user space. Recently, it was supplemented by a D-Bus API and a reference implementation, addressing the long-standing issue of maintaining GPIO state persistence across different processes.</p>\n<p>The sysfs interface is the primary user of the global GPIO number space in the kernel. Unlike other legacy components of the GPIO codebase, we cannot remove it without user space agreeing to stop using it. However, there remains a group of users who, for various reasons, refuse to migrate to the new uAPI. It has become evident that, without providing them with a 100% compatible experience, we will be stuck with the old interface indefinitely.</p>\n<p>To address this, the latest addition to the family of user-space GPIO utilities is gpiod-sysfs-proxy[1] - a libfuse-based user-space compatibility layer for the GPIO sysfs interface under /sys/class/gpio, using libgpiod to talk to the kernel.</p>\n<p>This talk will cover why we aim to remove /sys/class/gpio (along with the in-kernel legacy APIs), progress made so far, an introduction to gpiod-sysfs-proxy and the libgpiod D-Bus API, and a discussion of future plans.</p>\n<p>[1] https://github.com/brgl/gpiod-sysfs-proxy</p>",

This disrupted my smart charging automations, which were sending thousands of commands on a daily basis for tasks like solar charging and load balancing. To overcome this, I re-implemented Tesla's vehicle protocol in C++ for the ESP32 microcontroller, enabling local control of my Tesla by acting as a BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) vehicle key.</p>\n<p>In this talk, I'll give an overview of Tesla's vehicle protocol, dive into BLE communication using an ESP32, and show practical ESPHome implementations for common vehicle controls. The result is a cheap, open-source solution operating entirely locally with sub-second response times - no internet or API tokens required.</p>",

Instead, we will honestly discuss these pain points to help you understand better some of the design decisions behind Zephyr, and why they might (or might not!) actually be worth the steep learning curve. This will also prove to be an interesting exercise that will help you understand when you might not need or want an RTOS in the first place.</p>\n<p>Through practical demos and examples, we’ll show how tools like Devicetree, Kconfig, or West can actually make embedded development more efficient, and we'll try to make those \"scary\" parts of Zephyr more approachable, and give a sense of the roadmap for all the other areas of Zephyr that still need work and love.</p>",

Together, we decided on a USB-MIDI device, which soon became a hands-on learning journey into Zephyr, USB development, and the MIDI protocol.</p>\n<p>MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) has been the leading standard for connecting digital instruments and controllers since the 1980s. Although USB includes MIDIStreaming (a subclass of the Audio device class), Zephyr had no support for it. So, I decided to build one.</p>\n<p>In this talk, I’ll walk you through my adventures implementing (and eventually upstreaming) this new device class. We’ll start by revisiting the original MIDI 1 protocol from the eighties, the original USB-MIDI1.0 from the 2000s and the updated USB-MIDI2.0 specification from 2020. After a brief refresher on USB devices, I’ll introduce the USB MIDIStreaming interface and the various supported topologies. Finally, we’ll see how to bring it all together using Zephyr USB device_next, and how it is used from your application's code. In the end, we should be able to make any kind of MIDI speaking device using our favorite kite-stamped RTOS.</p>\n<p>Alongside this technical content, I may relate my experience as an occasional hobbyist contributor since Zephyr 1.14, and how I navigated spec updates (Device tree changes, USB-MIDI 1.0 to 2.0, Zephyr USB device next).</p>",

The goal was to create a community-friendly tool accessible to enthusiasts and professionals alike, with an ambitious vision of building a global, crowdsourced network of photometers. While the network is a story for another time, this talk focuses on the journey of designing and deploying the device itself.</p>\n<p>After writing down the requirements, we realized that the architecture—comprising I2C sensors, a microcontroller, and WiFi connectivity—was relatively straightforward. This simplicity gave us the opportunity to explore new technologies. In particular, could we use Rust to build a robust, unattended, battery-powered device?</p>\n<p>Fast forward to today: we have manufactured several hundred units and are collaborating with the <a href=\"https://iac.es/\">Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias</a>, a leading research institute, to rigorously test the devices under challenging conditions. In this session, we’ll share the lessons learned during development, the hurdles we overcame, and how Rust has since become an integral part of our workflow.</p>",

The protocol is agnostic about whether the collaboration that is being established concerns for instance a text file or a real-time video conference.</p>\n<p>We recently published this protocol as an Internet Draft, we run automated tests between implementers and we recently held a technical workshop about the protocol, where implementers came together to compare notes and discuss possible features to add.</p>\n<p>This talk will give an overview of how Open Cloud Mesh works and hopefully we can get into a discussion of how Open Cloud Mesh can be useful to others.</p>",

We’ll talk about our vision, technical implementation, and the challenges we encountered along the way.</p>\n<p>Collaborating with software like Etherpad or Hedgedoc feels a bit like magic: you can instantly see what others are typing. The downside is that you need to be online to access the content—since the document is on a server, it disappears as soon as you disconnect.</p>\n<p>We’re working on an open-source software called \"Ethersync\" to bring real-time collaboration to the file system! We want to make it possible to write notes and documentation together, and we’re also considering use cases like pair programming—directly in Neovim, VS Code, or perhaps your favorite text editor soon. We’re following a \"local-first\" approach, ensuring you always have control over your data since it’s stored on your own hard drive.</p>\n<p>In this talk, we’d like to explain our vision for this type of collaboration and show you our progress and current prototype. We’ll discuss some of the problems we’ve encountered and dive into the underlying technology (like Conflict-Free Replicating Data Types and Operational Transform).</p>\n<p>Finally, we'll discuss how you can get involved: For example, we could use help developing plugins for more text editors! We'll go over the Ethersync protocol, and discuss how it could help interoperability between collaborative projects.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Real-time editing offers users many advantages, editing conflicts are reduced, writing minutes before and during the meeting is much more effective, and much more. However, the fact that real-time editing is now a standard requirement for a modern visual editor is primarily due to the fact that user expectations have changed with Google Docs and Confluence. The open source world has faced and continues to face the challenge of keeping up. </p>\n<p>We have therefore extended the Wikimedia VisualEditor with real-time editing for the MediaWiki distribution BlueSpice. The result is a freely available, 100% open source solution for real-time editing, which is based on the most popular wiki software. </p>\n<p>In this talk we will provide a first, thoroughly self-critical field report: we will show which technical problems had to be solved, we will report on use cases and initial experiences and on the impact on knowledge sharing with wikis. For example, questions of version control and accountability had to be redefined. Was it worth the effort? Definitely.</p>",

His essay basically considers custom CMSes a way to lock in clients, and suggests cloud-first headless CMSes were the future. I, as well, have built multiple versions of custom CMSes, but I see it quite the opposite – even 8 years later, now is exactly the time to create a new CMS.</p>\n<p>In this talk I’m going to show the process, roadmap, dangers and successes of creating a content management system from the ground up. I’m going to talk through each of the parts, including errors and notification systems, issues and help systems, user and permissions systems, etc. I’m going to cover the many “required” layers of development that we just didn’t need that saved us thousands of hours and acquired a fraction of the technical debt.</p>",

The players haven’t changed much over the years, and the newer players seem mostly focused on monetization through scale and commerce. </p>\n<p>What can we do as a community to rethink the humble web CMS and open new pathways and ideas that could make a web CMS exciting again?

This talk will explain what ocaps is and why you should use it.</p>\n<p>Our current model of collaboration is broken.  Rather than basing our systems on granting consent, we base them on revoking authority.  Ocaps inverts this model with its \"if you don't have it, you can't use it\" approach, facilitated by restricted means of exchanging authority.  Meanwhile, the Object Capability Network protocol (<a href=\"https://ocapn.org/\">OCapN</a>) abstracts away transport mechanisms between objects while creating a security barrier with minimal overhead.  Altogether, this ocaps ecosystem enables secure collaboration in mutually-suspicious contexts by emphasizing and enforcing a consent-based approach to information and authority exchange.  Spritely is pioneering new tooling for ocaps with its <a href=\"https://spritely.institute/goblins/\">Goblins</a> library, which also serves as a model for other implementations; and has plans for solutions to problems like distributed storage, identity management, and even social networking.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>The RISC-V ecosystem currently relies on multiple disconnected repositories and specifications, including the assembly manual, opcode database, formal specifications like Sail and the non-machine readable ISA manual. This fragmentation of information is error prone and makes it hard for hardware designers, researchers, and tool developers to efficiently find, modify, and verify essential data. To address these challenges, we introduce the RISC-V Unified Database (UDB), a single, machine-readable source that consolidates and cross-validates RISC-V specifications against established resources like binutils and riscv-opcodes. Built through collaboration between engineers at industry-leading companies, the UDB already generates version-specific ISA manuals, instruction indexes, and standardized opcode definitions. Ongoing work extends to generating simulator configurations for QEMU and other instruction set simulators. The UDB's YAML-based format ensures broad compatibility and positions it as a foundation for next-generation RISC-V tools. This approach is starting to gain traction with official RISC-V working groups, including the Certification Steering Committee, which already uses the UDB for generating certification requirements. This talk explores UDB’s architecture, showcases its use cases, and invites you to contribute to this transformative project for the RISC-V community.</p>",

While there is a big focus on the next big thing in Software, many overlook the goldrush in Hardware.\nYou may have heard of companies like Nvidia, AMD or Axelera.AI, they are some of the ones selling the shovels to the diggers for a great profit margin. Have you ever wondered what it take to make your own chip? \nSo how to get started on your AI startup? The good news is: there is RISC-V, an open standard for CPUs, so everyone cam implement their own CPU and use common library software (in theory).  The even better news is there is an non profit open source organization called OpenHW Foundation offering high quality Apache 2.0 (or Solderpad) CPU Cores you can take as is, modify as needed and collaborate with a big community.\nEven better, the OpenHW Foundation is offering small platforms to debug on FPGA's but also has QEMU support and various other Models for example system Verilog cycle accurate SystemC Models. On top of this we also provide the Software eco system you need to brign your chip up and running quickly and sell it to one of the big Datacenter Companies, or just keep it running in your basement, heating your house and providing awesome AI edge capabilities for you and your family!\nIn this talk Flo will highlight the current trends in chip development and how open source is accelerating this from the Cores to the EDA tools for designing but also open source tapeouts and then focus a little more on some of the Cores in OpenWH and how you can utilize it. Dr Jeremy Bennett world famous for his 45min overviews on \"how to get GNU GCC ported on a totally new Architecture\" is joining to deliver an overview which Software you need to run on your Chip, to develop your Chip and why it is easy with the OpenHW Group.\nLast but not least we will spill the beans on how the European Union is supportign our work as a non profit (and also for profits in that context) to guarantee sovereignty and enable academic but also research and industrial to build and innovate on a common platform via the Chips JU and programs like TRISTAN and how you can benefit, no matter if you quickly develop a MCU in your Master, need to do some measurements on real RISC-V Cores for your PhD and prove how to boost performance or if you join the real business selling shovels to all the diggers.\nBelieve us, this talk will be a wild ride deep into the Hardware realm of RISC-V and OpenHW and make you start your own Chip while you are still listening!</p>",

Despite the unavailability of current-generation hardware with H Extensions, Advanced Interrupt Architecture (AIA), and IOMMU support, we are proactively building and testing our stack in preparation for future hardware releases. Centered around the rust-vmm framework, we enable lightweight hypervisors like Dragonball, StratoVirt, Cloud-Hypervisor, and Firecracker—all designed to provide high performance, strong isolation, and virtualization-based security. Integrating these hypervisors with Kata Containers, we explore virtualization-based isolation of containerized workloads on RISC-V. By simulating hardware environments and leveraging forward-compatible software designs, we aim to be fully prepared for the introduction of real RISC-V hardware that meets RVA23 standard and RISC-V Server Platform specification, ensuring a seamless deployment path for confidential computing and secure cloud-native platforms.</p>",

We will include taking an syzbot report and analysing what is going on during a strange kernel OOPS, and going through a user report of a crashing system where there was an issue with a Buildbot on a set of remote workers.</p>\n<p>As part of this we will go into how to decode kernel OOPs, how to dump object code and attempt to decpher bug reports without the aid of attaching a debugger.</p>",

We look at how performance has improved over the years and how performance compares to other cores, particularly those from Arm.  We'll explore the impact of different extensions and compilers on performance of compiled code.  We'll also look at how useful measuring performance using models is for predicting the performance of real silicon.</p>\n<p>Throughout we will use mostly the Embench benchmark suites, with some use of SPEC CPU for application class cores.  We will present the first results from the new Embench IoT version 2.0 test suite.</p>\n<p>Finally we will show how combining accurate benchmarking with simple machine learning can yield additional performance of compiled software.  This will be illustrated with the OpenHW CV32E40Pv2, where we were able to improve benchmarked code density by 7% in just 24 hours.</p>",

Zephyr integrates open-source and security best practices to ensure a vendor-neutral, secure, and reliable platform.</p>\n<p>One of the exciting features of the RISCV ISA is the Custom Function Unit (CFU), which enables a framework to support custom operations in hardware, which is accessible from software.

    "abstract": "<p>Historically, <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/gecko-dev\">Firefox</a> has relied on the <code>getaddrinfo</code> API for DNS resolution on most platforms. However, due to inherent limitations — such as the missing Time-To-Live (TTL) information — we sometimes had to resort to alternative APIs like <code>DNSQuery_A</code> on Windows.\nWhen implementing DNS over HTTPS (DoH), we developed our own DNS parser, which allowed Firefox to also resolve TXT and HTTPS records. But DoH isn't available to all our users.\nWith HTTPS records becoming increasingly important, we decided to resolve HTTPS queries using system APIs like <code>DNSQuery_A</code>, <code>res_query</code>, <code>res_nquery</code>, and <code>android_res_query</code>, with the expectation that this would cover all supported platforms. This talk will delve into the lessons learned from this journey and explain why these platform specific APIs often fall short of expectations.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>In an attempt to increase security and reduce spam, website services ask for more proofs.  Most services require you to confirm your email address, but nowadays, some services also demand a proof of domain ownership.  Sometimes you need to prove write access to a website.  Registration gets much harder, and we have to do it so often.  Time to rethink.</p>\n<p>We have been used to creating usernames for three decades by now, but the practice has reached it limits: users need to do much more to get access to a service.  A tiny simplification is offered via OpenID (\"Login via Google\"), but the new Open Console project offers a more integrated solution to build a trust relation between a person and a service provider.</p>\n<p>In Open Console, a person (or group) collects personal (and group) facts, and can share them with the requirements of the service.  When the service only needs a proven email-address, it only gets that email address, not your name.  The negotiation about which data is delivered is totally transparent and far more diverse.</p>\n<p>Besides personal facts, many different kinds of proofs can be maintained, like a proof of website-ownership.  You only need to prove ownership once, and this can be shared with any service which requires it.</p>\n<p>Proving website ownership is not easy. The focus of this talk is on the process of establishing this proof. There are many complications in checking the validity of a website. We implemented different approaches for this proof (via DNS, HTML-meta, and file).  We would also like to discuss the possible proofs of domain and network (ip-range) ownership with the participants: how to express them in DNS.</p>\n<p>Open Console received support from NGI OpenWebSearch.EU and the NLnet Foundation.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>If you want to use Android for your custom project, then you are almost inevitably going to have to modify the platform code. Typical reasons include supporting specialised hardware, running dedicated system services and pre-installing system apps. AOSP, and some parts of the Board Support Packages, are open source, so what's stopping you just changing the bits you need to? Indeed, this is the standard development model for Android platforms: fork; modify; repeat. Of course, we all know that forking is bad but there isn't any choice, especially when it is so difficult up merge changes upstream</p>\n<p>Well, maybe there is a choice, In this talk we will examine the problems created by simply forking Android, and we will look at various ways to make the process more maintainable. In particular we will look at using local_manifests, and at maintaining out of tree patches for AOSP. In the latter case, we will talk about the tooling required to track patch sets (\"layers\") and the dependencies between them.</p>\n<p>We hope that this will spark a conversation in the community through which we can establish best practice for maintaining custom Android systems without forking</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Progress in hardware development often leaves devices with outdated software versions behind. This primarily affects Android devices, especially as Google is currently accelerating its release schedule for Android versions. The rapid version change means that older devices are often left without software updates, which makes the devices vulnerable to security threats and compatibility problems. This presentation shows how this trend can be counteracted by upgrading a handheld device from Android 9 to Android 14 by using open-source components.</p>\n<p>We will outline the entire upgrade process from migrating the kernel to UI and HAL customizations to match the original device’s look and feel. This includes discussing technical challenges developers face when dealing with outdated drivers, newer kernel versions, and hardware abstractions during OS upgrades of old devices.</p>",

It's typically only used for the most severe and urgent cases, is limited in the amount of data it can transmit, and doesn't allow monitoring of other areas.

Through our hook system users can customize these to a\nlarge extent.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do you want to SSH into your phone and have all functionality available remotely?</li>\n<li>Do you like the idea of running a tiling window manager (sway, dwm) on your phone just like on your desktop?</li>\n<li>Do feel nostalgia for operating your phone with menus (dmenu, bemenu, wofi) and hardware buttons?</li>\n<li>Do you want to be the one in control of our own device and data, rather than be on the leash of big tech companies?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Then this talk may be interesting for you!</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Wireless displays are something most of us use, but in a fragmented and proprietary landscape. We propose a new approach to virtual screen sharing between Linux mobile and desktop devices.</p>\n<p>This solution uses a combination of video pipelines optimized for ARM and x86 hardware, D-Bus, and low-latency UDP streaming to create virtual “second monitors” and stream the desktop between peer devices. It is optimized to be usable even on low-power hardware such as the Librem 5, allowing us to repurpose older devices as secondary network monitors without proprietary tools. [2]</p>\n<p>In this talk, I will try to demystify some of the technicalities required for implementing efficient wireless desktop streaming using GStreamer, PipeWire, and D-Bus. To this end, we will explore how to build network video pipelines from scratch, with a focus on minimizing latency and making good use of hardware acceleration. Finally, we will present the Mirror Hall app, an experimental GTK4 app that encapsulates the above concepts.

    "abstract": "<p>Most, if not all, mobile devices have a GPS receiver in them, and most, if not all of them, support A-GPS. A-GPS as a technology is not designed with privacy in mind (in fact, it is specifically designed to not be private, as it sends the phones' IMSI to the A-GPS server), and one of the few providers of A-GPS services is Google. There exists, at present, no open source, privacy-respecting A-GPS service; mostly impacting FOSS on Mobile projects, such as Ubuntu Touch, who do not wish to use this Google service (and may not be allowed to either, as Google only officially provides SUPL services for Android devices, as far as I understand)</p>\n<p>The OpenAGPS project aims to create a open-source A-GPS / SUPL (Secure User Plane Positioning) service. GNSS systems (such as GPS) are both surprisingly simple and complicated; the talk would provide a short overview into the functioning of a GNSS system, how assisted GNSS / A-GPS / SUPL works, how a privacy-respecting system could be built, and the current state of the OpenAGPS project.</p>\n<p>This project has also received a grant from NLNet (Mobifree call) very recently; at the time of this submission we do not have any fully functioning code/codebase, although we hope to get a working prototype of the system in time for it to be potentially showed off as a working demo at FOSDEM.</p>\n<p>Website (slight update: placeholder has been replaced with a blog, although it's still not got <em>too</em> much yet): https://openagps.net/\nSource: https://gitlab.com/openagps/</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Arguably the single most important piece of software on any mobile phone is its Web browser. This is especially true on alternative mobile platforms where Web apps are often the best or only way to access essential services and functionality.</p>\n<p>While mobile apps are increasingly targeted at just the dominant platforms, they are also increasingly built using Web technologies, making them accessible to any platform with a decent browser. The result is that Linux-based mobile platforms beyond Android and iOS have the potential to be more viable than ever before.</p>\n<p>But the embedded browser landscape is in continual flux, with multiple offerings built on different technologies, including Blink, V8, WebKit, JavaScriptCore, Gecko, SpiderMonkey and Servo Layout. On top of these are frameworks intended to make their use more accessible to embedded systems. These include the Chromium Embedded Framework, Web Platform for Embedded, Qt WebEngine and Gecko WebView.</p>\n<p>In this talk I'll look at the different offerings available and consider their appropriateness for mobile Linux. What features do they offer, how practical is their use and why should you choose one over another? In particular I'll look at the minimal API needed for any practical implementation, how the APIs differ across the offerings and how they can be made use of as embedded browsers in mobile applications.</p>\n<p>To give a more complete understanding of what embedded browsers are like to use in practice, the talk will include example applications with demonstration code.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p><a href=\"https://brew.sh/\">Homebrew</a>, the popular package manager, thrives on macOS and x86_64 Linux, but a small group of hobbyists has also been leveraging it on ARM64-based Linux devices like Raspberry Pis to install up-to-date software. While Homebrew is not officially supported on ARM64 Linux, this talk explores the technical hurdles for adapting the package manager to this platform. We'll examine the work done so far and the ongoing work needed to make Homebrew more accessible and reliable for ARM64 Linux users.</p>",

By utilizing Snaps, the project enables the creation of distribution-independent packages, allowing scanner drivers to be easily installed on any system that supports snapd. Additionally, scanner applications can be containerized using OCI containers, facilitating their deployment on immutable operating systems. Key components of the project include the integration of scanner support into the PAPPL library, originally developed for printer applications. This integration supports multi-function devices and provides a unified driver format for both printers and scanners.

    "abstract": "<p>Most software build systems, following the tradition of make, refer to artifacts by an assigned location on the file system. However, when developing software, one is usually more interested in the contents of the file than its location. So why not take the definition itself as key? Similarly, when building typical complex targets, like libraries, additional information has to be considered when using them, e.g., transitive dependencies when linking. So why not make that part of the data of the analyzed library? In this way, we obtain definitions that are independent of their origin and hence can meaningfully be cached. This high-level caching allows a seamless transition between fine-granular building and traditional package building (obtaining all artifacts by a single lookup). As an additional benefit, when using remote build execution, it is enough to have the sources of the project you're working on, while still having the benefits of a bootstrapped build.</p>\n<p>All those concepts are implemented in the open-source build system justbuild, available, at <a href=\"https://github.com/just-buildsystem/justbuild\">https://github.com/just-buildsystem/justbuild</a></p>",

It can choose the destination node based on simple or complex rules, such as the user name/group, its previous connections, the number of total connections on the nodes, the total used bandwidth of the nodes… It can be distributed on multiple gateways, with shared states. It can track, log and monitor all the connections.</p>\n<p>At CEA (French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission), sshproxy allows users to connect to 4 different supercomputers, with regularly more than 1,000 simultaneous connections.</p>",

For the communication, the library implements a proactive distance vector routing protocol. Using LoRaMesher, an IoT application running on a node can send and receive data packets to and from other nodes in the LoRa mesh network. LoRaMesher has been tested on embedded boards featuring an ESP32 microcontroller and a LoRa radio. Using LoRaMesher, nodes do not connect to a LoRaWAN gateway, but among themselves. This allows new, distributed applications solely built upon tiny IoT nodes.</p>",

For the last five years, I have been running the technical side of a local theatre company with only free and open source software. Come to my talk to hear how we did it, what software we use(d) (and why), and what kind of bumps we hit.</p>\n<p>We use open source software for the entire process, from preparation (writing the script, holding meetings), to ticket sales, our website, seat planning, audio mixing and broadcasting, video broadcasting and programming the lights. No closed source software is used in the process. An added challenge is that neither the theatre group, nor the public, are a technical audience or are aware what open source software is.</p>\n<p>If you ever want to assist your local theatre group (do, they really can use technical people who don’t want to be on stage), come and listen!</p>",

These weren’t just tools; they empowered creators, listeners, and developers while keeping podcasting open and decentralized.</p>\n<p>In a surprising turn, even Apple—long resistant to adopting anything \"not invented here\"—embraced the Podcasting 2.0 DTD specification in April 2024, bringing transcription features to its platform.</p>\n<p>This was a milestone for open standards and open source. Transcriptions improve accessibility for millions, while also boosting SEO, content discoverability, and personalized recommendations. Through Castopod—one of the first platforms to implement Podcasting 2.0 features.</p>\n<p>A grassroots, open-source movement is reshaping an entire industry.</p>\n<p>But this victory is just the beginning.\nTogether, let us explore how the lessons of Podcasting 2.0 can be applied to other areas, ensuring that technology remains open, accessible, and collaborative.</p>\n<p>Sources:\n- <a href=\"https://code.castopod.org/adaures/castopod\">Castopod source code</a>\n- <a href=\"https://podcasting2.org/podcast-namespace\">Podcasting 2.0 Namespace</a>\n- <a href=\"https://archive.fosdem.org/2023/schedule/event/podcasting20/\">How Podcasting 2.0 will save the Open Internet</a> (FOSDEM 2023)</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Bots and spam are challenges for online platforms. Traditional CAPTCHAs help block bots, but often involve improving proprietary maps and software, while exposing user information to third-party CAPTCHA providers. OpenStreetMap (OSM) has many objects remaining to be mapped, but the quality of AI-generated objects is not high enough for direct inclusion. We introduce “MapTCHA”, a CAPTCHA that leverages the uncertainty of interpreting imagery with computer vision, and provides human verification for AI predictions: users are asked to identify images containing correctly interpreted objects, e.g. building outlines.</p>\n<p>We separate known positive cases, where both the AI prediction and OSM contain an object, from unknown cases, where objects are only in the prediction. We also generate known negatives from areas where objects are neither in OSM nor in the prediction. We show a mix of these images without telling the user which are which. Humans are validated by confirming the known positives and negatives, and we determine the truth of the unknown images by aggregating users’ responses through voting. When the voting indicates high confidence that an object exists, we suggest the location for OSM mapping.</p>\n<p>Our prototype identifies buildings using aerial imagery with high enough resolution to visualise individual buildings and medium-sized objects. Image recognition is provided by fAIr, an open-source AI-assisted mapping system developed by the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT). It allows the training and fine-tuning of pre-trained machine learning models to segment building footprints.</p>\n<p>Future plans include expanding to more objects and types of imagery; refining AI models; integrating MapTCHA into various login systems; and enhancing the user interface.</p>\n<p>In this session we will talk about how we are building this solution, how it might enhance mapping efforts in OSM that will support projects on the ground, and some of the challenges of working with AI derived data.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Have you ever gotten lost in a building and wished they had some sort of navigation system or at least a floor plan? I have, unfortunately, and it was only later that I realised that not only they had a floor plan online - but they had a navigation app for that building. The reality is that a user who is not familiar with a building will not find such an app until it's too late. Indoor environments sometimes have public floorplans available via some service. Similarly, more and more indoor positioning systems are being deployed in buildings to provide navigation services or asset tracking. However, as a person visiting a building, you are often not aware that these services exist or where to find them. Even if some global registry exists to discover this data, it is often proprietary, discouraging developers from interfacing with such systems. I want to bring a shift into the landscape of indoor positioning systems and services and solve this! In this presentation, I will talk about discovering indoor environments and positioning systems through proximity-based discovery methods and linked data. How nice would it be, that instead of downloading the FOSDEM app, you simply use Google Maps or any open-source navigation application to find the location of this talk?</p>",

They observe the earth continuously and collect enormous amounts of data that provide valuable insights into environmental, climatic, and geospatial changes. These data are used for various applications, including Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) mapping, environmental monitoring, disaster response, climate change analysis, and agricultural monitoring.\nThe Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem makes these data freely available to users, along with tools for processing and analysis. It encourages researchers, developers, and organizations to use these products for various applications, from scientific studies to practical environmental monitoring solutions. These products include but are not limited to, Sentinel data, Digital Elevation Models (DEMs), mosaics, and service products like biophysical parameters such as FAPAR (Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation). In addition to these products, the ecosystem also provides a range of tools, including cloud-computing environments and APIs, to simplify and enhance the usability of Earth Observation data.\nIn this session, we will explore how, in addition to freely available data, the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem provides several open-source capabilities to simplify and enhance EO data usability. These include a cloud-computing environment like JupyterLab, a user-friendly Copernicus Browser for easy data exploration, and APIs like STAC and openEO for streamlined data access and integration. By offering these resources openly, the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem supports a growing community of users, helping them turn satellite data into actionable knowledge to address global challenges.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Dealing with web mapping can be complicated, and when tasked with the requirement of drawing on one, things can quickly become a challenging, especially when dealing with complex requirements. Enter Terra Draw: an open source JavaScript library designed to simplify and standardise drawing functionality across popular web mapping libraries such as Leaflet, OpenLayers, Google Maps, MapboxGL JS, and MapLibreGL JS.</p>\n<p>Terra Draw offers a versatile set of built-in drawing modes, enabling seamless creation of geometries. The library supports simpler geometry types like points lines and polygons, but also more complex modes like rectangles, circles and sectors. There is also advanced functionalities like snapping, rotation, and scaling, which often require significant effort to implement from scratch. These functionalities are designed to \"just work\" across the different mapping ecosystems.</p>\n<p>The library’s modular design promotes extensibility, allowing developers to create custom drawing modes and adapters for new mapping libraries that may come along. Thanks to its decoupled architecture, any mode can work with any adapter, creating a multiplier effect. This flexibility also ensures that swapping out one mapping library should be much simpler, as the drawing logic is abstracted away from the mapping library.</p>\n<p>In this talk, we’ll explore the origins of Terra Draw, demonstrate how to get started, and provide a glimpse of what's possible with it. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting with web maps, you'll walk away with practical insights on how Terra Draw can be used in your project.</p>",

How can we fluidly download data from OpenStreetMap using the Overpass Query Language, run performant queries with GEOS, calculate projections with PROJ, store and manipulate GeoJSON or WKT-formatted data with duckdb's spatial extention, and then visualize things with a javascript library like Leaflet or Deck.gl?</p>\n<p>This talk explores Raku's expressive and powerful style as we mesh together all of these things, creating new modules along the way, and leapfrogging ahead of other implementations with some of Raku's unique features such as NativeCall for native libraries, Grammars for parsing, multiple modes of interacting with command line tooling, and plentiful concurrency models.   Also let's see how we can reign in large language models so that we can apply them judiciously to our data and our code.</p>\n<p>Links:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://raku.land/zef:bduggan/GEOS\">raku-geos</a>, <a href=\"https://raku.land/cpan:BDUGGAN/Geo::Basic\">Geo::Basic</a>, <a href=\"https://raku.land/zef:bduggan/WebService::Overpass\">WebService::Overpass</a>, <a href=\"https://raku.land/zef:kjpye/Geo::Geometry\">Geo::Geometry</a>, <a href=\"https://raku.land/zef:bduggan/Duckie\">Duckie</a>, <a href=\"https://raku.land/zef:bduggan/WebService::Nominatim\">WebService::Nominatum</a></p>",

While developing a new C-based driver is not something we could do in the short term, thankfully, using the program() source of syslog-ng still allowed us to create a new source in just a few hours, including its documentation.\nFrom this talk, you can learn how the freebsd-audit() source was created and how you can also easily develop similar sources yourself. A few more FreeBSD specific developments will also be mentioned.</p>",

Yet, nearly 80% of the global tech community remains underrepresented and faces numerous inclusivity barriers beyond just language. In this session, we'll see how open-source organizations have harnessed their diverse voices to craft a community that includes all identities, gender representations, and multilingual accessibility. By the end of this session, attendees will gain practical insights to implement these inclusive standards in their work, ensuring their community is welcoming and accessible to all.</p>\n<p>This session highlights a critical issue in the tech industry - THE LACK OF INCLUSIVITY. While this problem spans multiple sectors, we will focus specifically on community practices. We'll explore how language barriers, gender biases, and accessibility gaps have historically excluded many from fully engaging with Community. We'll also look at how some of the most successful open-source communities, such as Kubernetes, and Django have faced inclusivity challenges before, how they have tackled them head-on, and what we can learn from their experiences.</p>\n<p>This session is also to hear the voices of those who have faced issues and could share their experiences. So We can get more ideas and as an Open Source, be more inclusive.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>The Model for Economic Tipping point Analysis (META) is one of a new generation of climate-economy integrated assessment models used to study the economic impacts of climate change. A typical output of such models is an estimate of the social cost of greenhouse gas emissions, a measure of the economic damage caused over its lifetime by a ton of greenhouse gas such as CO2 or CH4. </p>\n<p>META, however, computes many other economic as well as geophysical indicators. As its name suggests, META was built specifically to estimate the economic impact of tipping points in the climate system. To do so, META incorporates different tipping points modules, each of which replicate a geophysically realistic tipping point module from a study in the climate economics research literature. </p>\n<p>META was originally introduced in Dietz, Rising, Stoerk and Wagner (2021, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2103081118), and has since been updated and ported to Julia using the Mimi Framework. Follow-up research has improved several components of META. Similarly, META estimates have been used to inform conversations with authorities in the EU and the US. </p>\n<p>In this talk, I will give a short overview of META's structure, its capabilities, and ideas for the community on how to further improve and use META for open research in the future. </p>\n<p>META is freely available on Github under a GPL-3.0 copyleft licence: https://github.com/openmodels/META</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>This presentation aims at presenting a fully open-source pipeline to extract, curate, and explore web archives, a captive data source whose access is restricted. Its purpose is to detail both the technical pipeline and the socio-institutional setting that made it possible to emerge, highlighting the challenges of developing open tools for closed sources.</p>\n<p>The French web archives is an institutional repository of data maintained by the French National Library (BnF). It contains more than 2 petabytes of data spanning over close to 30 years, which accounts to more than 50 billion web pages. Access to this data is restricted under the heritage and legal deposit law: academic researchers willing to work on web archives as data are expected to submit research projects that, upon a formal or informal agreement, will enable them to access this data. But what then?\nBuilding the methodological means to pursue epistemological goals in that context is particularly challenging. Web archivists do provide toolkits for exploration. Recent initiatives have scaled up the effort to make these sources more accessible. The RESPADON project has successfully managed to build a “captive web archive” capacity into the Hyphe software, and in doing so has opened a new way into developing tools for such data.</p>\n<p>In this presentation, we will present a new solution to extensively study, at the qualitative level, specific topics in the full-text indexed collections of the French web archives. Built around the PANDORÆ software, this pipeline has been designed to interrogate the captive data source on site, but also extract relevant metadata in a compliant manner to enable its exploration off-site, while ensuring reproducibility by publishing the code. In doing so, this pipeline provides an up-to-date example of the “one-way mirror” situation of building open tools that are fit to operate on closed data sources.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>In high-energy physics, ensuring that analyses remain reproducible and interpretable over time is a significant challenge. As the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) produces vast datasets and as analyses evolve, reproducibility becomes crucial for both current and future research efforts. Rivet (Robust Independent Validation of Experiment and Theory) addresses this challenge by providing a framework for the preservation and reinterpretation of LHC analyses. This talk will discuss how Rivet facilitates analysis preservation, enabling researchers to reproduce, validate, and reuse complex particle collision studies long after initial publication. We’ll explore specific use cases, including how Rivet supports reinterpretation for new physics searches, and the technical underpinnings that make Rivet an indispensable tool for long-term data analysis preservation. This presentation will emphasise Rivet’s role within the broader landscape of open science and data preservation, with insights into its integration with other high-energy physics frameworks. Attendees will gain a clear understanding of Rivet’s contributions to sustainable research practices and reproducibility within the scientific community.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>The talk will introduce CartABl https://igarun.univ-nantes.io/CartABl/ , a free (GPL) web-based authoring tool for creating interactive maps and figures, and discuss its impact on user workflows and design decisions. Designed primarily for geographers and cartographers, CartABl also serves broader communities seeking to produce interactive cartographic content. It addresses the technical barrier that coding poses to creating interactive cartographic content (using js) through a graphical interface for defining interactions. It integrates seamlessly with traditional workflows by enhancing maps created in vector graphics editors like Inkscape or Adobe Illustrator with interactivity, without requiring programming knowledge. CartABl leverages SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) as its base format, embedding interactive rules as declarative elements interpreted by a lightweight JavaScript runtime. This results in standalone, browser-compatible interactive SVG files, preserving the scalability and versatility of the format.</p>\n<p>The development of CartABl follows an instrumental genesis approach, where tool and user co-evolve through iterative feedback. Initial prototypes allowed basic interactivity like tooltips and layer toggling. Feedback from its application in projects such as L’Atlas Bleu, a journal focused on coastal and marine maps, guides its refinement. This iterative process not only improves the tool but also influences how cartographers structure and design their graphical maps and figures: the structure of the graphical objects must be adapted to facilitate the definition of interaction rules, and the interactive features proposed by the tool impact the design decisions of the users.</p>\n<p>CartABl aims to democratize interactive cartography, making it accessible and intuitive for professionals and non-experts alike. By transforming workflows and expanding the possibilities of digital cartographic publishing, it stands out as a valuable resource for advancing geographic and graphic research and communication.</p>",

While platforms like Transkribus and eScriptorium excel at generating text from handwritten material, they leave visualization to the side—Transkribus hides its solution behind a paywall, and eScriptorium offers none at all. Yet, for many research endeavors, the line-by-line relationship between text and image remains critical, as seen in projects like the Beckett Digital Manuscript Project and the Joyce Letters Project.</p>\n<p>Designed as a lightweight, embeddable React component, Necturus makes it easy for libraries, archives, and researchers to present manuscript images alongside their transcriptions in an interactive and accessible format. A plug-and-play template allows deployment via GitHub Pages with no coding required, while a full version supports scalable, customizable setups for larger projects. By emphasizing both transcription and the manuscript as objects of study, Necturus offers a practical solution for those who value visualization in the process of, as Transkribus puts it, “unlocking the past”.</p>\n<p><strong>Project Repositories: <a href=\"https://github.com/NoonShin/Necturus-Viewer/\">Necturus</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/eXtant-CMG/Necturus-Viewer-Compact/\">Necturus Compact</a></strong></p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Panoptic is a tool to explore locally and easily big images datasets: https://github.com/CERES-Sorbonne/Panoptic\nImages abound on the web and digital social networks. Their proliferation is one of the characteristics of digital culture. In particular, they are widely mobilized in contemporary controversies, with the aim of revealing and debating important social issues. Far beyond natively digital images, whether moving or still, images are first and foremost an object of study in their own in many disciplines (art history, film studies...), just as they can be a way of accessing a research field (photographs of animal and plant species, pages from digitized books...). A key challenge for the human and social sciences is to equip themselves with tools for exploring, sorting and annotating image corpora.</p>\n<p>While a number of tools already exist for working with such corpora (XnView, Tropy, voxel51, Aikon, Arkindex<strong>,</strong> for example), a key issue to be resolved is the multiplication in the number of images we work with: how can we efficiently explore, sort and annotate a corpus of several tens of thousands of images? How can we provide researchers with a tool that facilitates such work?</p>\n<p>Indeed, working with a large number of images means first of all having a synoptic view of them, in order to understand them as a whole, but also being able to manipulate them directly in the presentation interface (for both exploration and analysis).</p>\n<p>Secondly, working with a large number of images also imposes time constraints on analysis, which can be resolved by using similar-image clustering tools (computer vision tools), to group together images that have formal similarities (reduces exploration time), but also by using batch annotation functionalities (reduces analysis time).</p>\n<p>Finally, working with images is rarely just about working with images, but also with textual data associated with the images (texts of tweets, photographer's name, shooting date, etc.). Another challenge, then, is to adopt a plurisemiotic approach to the content of the corpus being worked on, in order to avoid having to move back and forth between different work spaces.</p>\n<p>Created at CERES, by developers, researchers and designers, Panoptic is an open source tool for visualizing, exploring and annotating large images corpora. In particular, the tool integrates algorithms for grouping images by similarity (by using ml model CLIP), to help users with sorting and exploration. The tool also offers various filtering, search and annotation options, enabling the creation, analysis and export of sub-corpora.</p>\n<p>Our talk will present the tool we have developed, and how its various functions are designed to meet the methodological needs of research using tools for working with large volumes of images.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Open-source software has been a powerful catalyst for innovation in computer and software engineering, driving significant advancements in healthcare, particularly in medical and surgical technologies. Recently, the open-source movement has expanded beyond software, encompassing the release of code, data, and AI models, further accelerating progress across diverse fields. However, in healthcare, open-sourcing faces distinct challenges, including navigating regulatory hurdles to meet industry standards, ensuring robust patient data protection, managing the costs of specialised hardware and software maintenance, and addressing the limited availability of expert clinicians needed to annotate, test, and validate AI innovations.\nIn this talk, Miguel will explore how open-source technologies are advancing healthcare, with a focus on medical and surgical innovations. He will highlight key advancements while exploring the complexities of clinical translation, using three of his projects as examples: Fetal Ultrasound Image Synthesis, endoscopy-based video analysis for surgery, and real-time AI diagnosis of eye movement disorders. The talk will examine the challenges of clinical translation and showcase examples of innovative technologies that leverage open-source software, models, and data to address some of the most complex problems in healthcare. Finally, to inspire and spark innovation among the next generation of engineers, researchers, and clinicians from academia and industry, this talk will showcase how the emerging open-source software community for surgical and medical technologies is striving to: (a) Foster Collaboration and Community Building, (b) Enhance Security and Transparency, (c) Promote Customisation and Flexibility, (d) Ensure Cost-Effectiveness, Sustainability, and Scalability, and (e) Drive Rapid Innovation and Future-Proofing.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>This presentation introduces Active Tigger, an open-source research tool designed to accelerate collaborative text annotation in the social sciences.</p>\n<p>The increasing use of text-as-data in social science research has created a pressing need for efficient annotation tools. While small datasets can be manually annotated, the exponential growth in available textual data (e.g., from newspapers and social media) demands solutions that enable collaborative annotation and automation. Moreover, the emergence of generative AI and large language models (LLMs) has highlighted the importance of robust corpus annotation practices, particularly for evaluating prompt-engineered outputs from LLM-as-a-service platforms like OpenAI or Hugging Face.</p>\n<p>To address these challenges, we created an annotation platform, Active Tigger. A first version was developed in 2022 using R and RShiny (J. Boelaert, GitLab Repository). This tool embeds several annotation heuristics, including active learning—iteratively predicting and selecting annotations to maximize training quality—to help researchers build training datasets in order to fine-tuning encoder models. The tool quickly became integral to the research team's activities and beyond, which incited us to develop of a second, more robust version.</p>\n<p>The current iteration of Active Tigger, built with a Python-based API and a React frontend, introduces enhanced flexibility and scalability. It supports collaborative workflows, accommodates a broader range of use cases, and is now in beta testing, with early adopters exploring its potential.</p>\n<p>This presentation will cover three key aspects:</p>\n<p>The journey of Active Tigger: From addressing specific social science needs to adapting to the evolving landscape of LLMs.\nShowcase: Demonstrating the annotation workflow using active learning and BERT fine-tuning.\nFuture directions: Exploring the tool's evolution in the context of widespread LLM availability, discussing the trade-offs between focusing on specialized tasks and enabling broader applications.</p>\n<p>Github repository of Active Tigger : https://github.com/emilienschultz/activetigger</p>",

The course is designed to break down barriers to research literacy and amplify underrepresented voices in open science. It is targeted at research enthusiasts, citizen scientists, early-career researchers, and Research Software Engineers (RSEs) from non-academic backgrounds. </p>\n<p>Currently in its early stages, Pre-seeds aims to create a flexible, modular curriculum covering key aspects of research often taken for granted, such as research design, ethical considerations, data management, and collaborative practices. The project leverages open tools like GitHub to promote collaboration, transparency, and reproducibility, inviting broad participation across disciplines and experience levels.</p>\n<p>This session will present Pre-Seeds as a growing, collaborative effort to build an inclusive research ecosystem.

These platforms exist on an open repository of human knowledge accessible to everyone, and empower scientific communities to elevate from that repository research that aligns with their values, quality definitions, and scope with minimal friction.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>DeSci Publish:</strong><br />\n   Operating on CODEX, DeSci Publish redefines scientific publishing by allowing researchers to share data, code, manuscripts, and more as versionable objects. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Granular Citation Systems:</strong><br />\n   Through dPIDs, CODEX, and decentralized platforms, SciOS enables journals to credit contributions ranging from datasets and software to peer review and editorial work.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Automating Metadata Creation:</strong><br />\n   In partnership with DeSci Labs and Discourse Graphs, SciOS automates the generation of metadata and discourse nodes. This initiative creates a map of research claims and evidence, allowing researchers to evaluate the relevance of prior work at a granular level.  </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Research Assessment Tools:</strong><br />\n   Collaborating with the CoARA ERIP working group, SciOS is developing tools that combine human expertise with AI to evaluate modular research objects. These tools enable clear, reliable assessments tailored for rapid response to research outputs.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Open Source Permanent Versionable Containers and Attestation Platform:</strong><br />\n   SciOS supports this platform to create immutable repositories for software tools. It provides versionable digital containers enriched by community validations, enabling researchers and engineers to track, validate, and determine software impact across domains.  </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Institute of Open Science Practices (IOSP):</strong><br />\n   IOSP fosters collaboration between researchers and technologists, guiding the adoption of innovative infrastructure. It facilitates workshops and conferences powered by novel tools, enabling open science practices throughout the research lifecycle.  </p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p>Join us to explore how SciOS’s collaborative efforts and cutting-edge tools are transforming open science.

    "abstract": "<p>In the digital age, the pervasive presence of the internet has fundamentally altered the landscape of capitalism, knowledge and human communication. However, alongside its transformative potential, voluntary data sharing in the public interest, or data donation, is plagued by systemic issues, ranging from lack of trust and privacy breaches to legal uncertainty, undermining its intended role as a democratizing force. </p>\n<p>Recognizing this brokenness, we turn to the concept of digital repair as a lens through which to understand and address these deficiencies. Drawing from social innovation and data governance theories, this abstract advances the sociology of repair centered on the concept of data altruism, the new EU framework for voluntary data sharing for objectives of general interest, including scientific research purposes. This talk explores the potential of data donation as a means to not only rectify the fractures in the digital data ecosystem, but also to stimulate a more socially sustainable data economy. </p>\n<p>By conceptualizing data donation within the framework of sociology of repair, this talk proposes its implications for reframing data agency, and advancing notions of digital constitutionalism. This talk is explicitly an effort to facilitate discussion about useful and plausible conceptual tools to theorize data donation. Through an ethnographically-informed investigation, this talk contributes to an understanding of the infrastructure enabling data altruism for scientific research purposes in the Netherlands, offering insights that are fruitful for navigating future research journeys into the European data economy.</p>",

We have thus constructed a framework to understand and to explain Research Software and Research Data in the Open Science context [5].</p>\n<p>This framework is constructed in three stages: definition, dissemination, and evaluation of these research outputs [2,3,4], and it is now completed with answers to the Borgman's conundrum challenges for Research Data [3] and for Research Software [6].</p>\n<p>In this talk we will present our answers to the Borgman's conundrum challenges,  and we will explain the comparison methodologies that we have developed in order to construct and to complete this Open Science framework.</p>\n<p>It is our understanding that to provide correct and clear answers to the conundrum questions will have, as a consequence, the improvement of Research Software and Research Data sharing and dissemination practices, which, in turn, will enhance trustworthiness, correctness, rigor, reproducibility, reusability and transparency in the research endeavor.</p>\n<p>This is a joint work with Prof. Tomas Recio, Universidad Antonio de Nebrija, Madrid.</p>\n<p>This FOSDEM'25 presentation follows and extends our previous talks at FOSDEM:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[FOSDEM'21] Free/Open source Research Software production at the Gaspard-Monge Computer Science laboratory.

    "abstract": "<p>Modern slavery impacts millions of people worldwide, posing urgent ethical and human rights challenges In response, the UK and Australian Modern Slavery Acts require companies meeting specific revenue thresholds to produce annual modern slavery statements, aiming to increase accountability in addressing modern slavery risks. Since 2016, Walk Free and Wikirate have partnered to assess companies’ response to these Acts, leveraging Wikirate’s open-data platform. This assessment considers whether companies are releasing statements that meet the legal requirements, but also if they detail policies and actions that go beyond compliance to enable businesses to better respond to modern slavery. Key to this initiative is its open, collaborative approach, and therefore, a set of accessible metrics on Wikirate that empowers non-expert researchers to contribute meaningfully. Through the project, volunteers and researchers have conducted an in-depth analysis of over 2000 MSA statements. Over the years, the project has mobilized thousands of volunteers and engaged over 20 universities worldwide, using Wikirate’s crowdsourcing platform to organize and perform research at scale. The insights generated through the research not only inform Walk Free’s advocacy efforts with governments and companies but also demonstrate the power of open research principles in tackling complex global issues.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>The \"Do No Harm\" principle, well-established in fields like medical research, healthcare, and humanitarian aid, has significant potential to improve the quality and reduce the negative effects of open research practices and technology.</p>\n<p>As open research/science practices become a norm across different disciplines, it is important to identify, improve awareness of, and reduce its known or unintended negative impacts on people and their communities. While efforts like ethical source licenses (like the Do No Harm and Hippocratic License) are yet to become an acceptable legal pathway to enforcing responsible practices in open source, more general adoption and use of the \"Do No Harm\" will help account for societal and environmental implications of research and technology.</p>\n<p>In this talk, I will introduce a “do no harm” framework to identify risks and develop actionable plans to mitigate the negative impacts of open research practices and technology. This framework examines the development and deployment of technology across four critical areas: the actors involved or affected, the dynamics and relationships within impacted communities, the economic realities faced by researchers, and environmental impact. Additionally, I will highlight practical methods for addressing the potential negative consequences of our work.</p>\n<p>This session is designed for anyone involved in open source/science, including researchers, designers, contributors, developers, maintainers, and community members who seek to better understand and navigate the ethical challenges of open research and technology. Attendees will gain insights into global disparities in technology and explore how they can share responsibility to ensure their work promotes more equitable benefits by combining open practices with the do-no-harm principle.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Cloud Native databases architecture has evolved to leverage the elasticity, reliability and scalability available in the cloud. There is a growing trend to leverage object storage systems such as  AWS S3 for architecting cost-effective, performant and scalable systems. S3 is a large-scale, high throughput key-value storage system, which it trades for a slightly higher latency. In this session we will present techniques used to leverage S3 for a low latency scalable distributed SQL database, in particular how  to get around S3’s high latency by leveraging a novel new LSM Cloud Storage Engine that uses EBS as a cache to lower latency.</p>",

Then, we will dive deep into the design decisions made by YDB to address these difficulties and sketch YDB's architecture layer by layer - from the bare metal disks and distributed storage up to OLTP and OLAP functionalities.

As one of the most robust solutions for managing large-scale database workloads, Vitess on Kubernetes powers some of the largest systems in the world.</p>\n<p>Modern data teams face a growing challenge: scaling databases dynamically to handle surges, such as holiday sales or viral trends. For many, vertical scaling has reached its limits, leaving fundamental architectural changes as the only option. Vitess, with its built-in horizontal sharding capabilities, provides a seamless path for organizations to scale beyond the constraints of legacy MySQL or Aurora clusters.\nThis talk explores how Vitess enables smooth migrations from Aurora and MySQL into Kubernetes clusters with near-zero downtime. We will begin with an overview of Vitess’ architecture, highlighting horizontal sharding and its advantages for scaling. Next, we will dive into the powerful workflows Vitess provides for data import and live production migrations, emphasizing their safety, efficiency, and reversibility—even for massive datasets.</p>\n<p>To ground these concepts, we will share real-world examples of successful migrations from web-scale Aurora and legacy MySQL databases, including performance metrics, data sizes, and challenges encountered. Attendees will gain practical insights and a clear blueprint for transitioning large-scale database systems to Vitess, unlocking unprecedented scalability and operational agility.</p>",

Through practical examples, we’ll demonstrate its role in migrating MySQL workloads to TiDB, including shard consolidation.</p>\n<p>Next, we’ll highlight <strong><a href=\"https://github.com/pingcap/tiflow\">TiCDC (TiDB Change Data Capture)</a></strong>, a powerful tool for real-time data streaming. We’ll explain how TiCDC captures changes in TiDB and replicates them to downstream systems such as TiDB, MySQL, Apache Kafka, and other services. Use cases include easily reversible TiDB version upgrades, cross-region high availability with standby TiDB clusters, and real-time Change Data Capture into Kafka.</p>\n<p>Throughout the talk, we’ll share practical tips and scenarios, including simplifying database migrations, minimising downtime during upgrades, and ensuring data integrity in complex workflows.</p>\n<p>Whether you’re migrating from MySQL to TiDB, upgrading TiDB clusters, or building cross-region high availability environments, this talk will equip you with the knowledge and strategies to leverage replication as a powerful tool in your database operations.</p>",

For many workloads, this allows robust deployment in smaller heap sizes.</p>\n<p>This talk provides selected performance comparisons with traditional Shenandoah, Generational ZGC, and G1 GC. It provides selection criteria for helping to determine whether Generational mode of Shenandoah is a good match for your service needs.  It also provides best-practice recommendations for how to tune Generational Shenandoah to extract the greatest value for your particular service.</p>",

Clearly, NMT must extend itself if it intends to remain a useful tool.</p>\n<p>In this talk, I will present a design for extending NMT to core libraries and a possible future extension to FFM. External APIs will be shown in the context of porting small portions of the core libraries. Internal design details, including data structure design, will likewise be presented and its trade offs discussed. Finally, possible ways of bringing NMT and the new Foreign Function &amp; Memory API will be presented.</p>",

After having it implemented for PowerPC, I'd like to discuss how the JVM handles native function calls and Java callbacks, focusing on key concepts like stack layouts, calling conventions, and cross-platform challenges.\nThe session is intended for developers curious about the technical foundations of free and open Java technologies and how JVM enhancements like the FFI API are realized. It will shed light on the low-level mechanisms that enable seamless integration of Java with native code while maintaining the performance and safety Java developers expect.</p>",

Initially, a variety of different approaches were under\nconsideration and the first proposed solutions only started to\nclarify around 18 months ago. An early preview of the 'premain'\nsolution, prototyped by Oracle, was presented at the August 2023 JVM\nLanguage Summit. It has been under very active development since then,\nwith a team that includes developers from Oracle, Red Hat, Microsoft,\nAmazon and Google, and has already delivered improvements to JDK and\napplication startup time in OpenJDK 24 via JEP 483. The plan is for the\nproject to deliver a series of JEPs that improve performance\nstep by step rather than wait for a complete, shrink-wrapped solution\nand the Leyden team is already working on the next set of enhancements.\nIn this talk we will explain what was delivered in JEP 483 and how it\nworks to improve startup, then go on to describe what other features are\nin the pipeline. We will also touch upon some of the barriers we\ncurrently face to improving performance and ideas we are exploring to\nresolve them.</p>",

The next phase is to allow to flatten value class into fields, but for that we need to get ride of null as a possible value.\nThis talk is about the challenges to introduce nullness emotion ('?'

    "abstract": "<p>When browsers load a Web page and its subresources, A LOT happens under the hood. They need to take into account render/parsing blocking resources, use a preload scanner, listen to resource hints (like preload/preconnect), loading modifiers (async/defer/module), fetchpriority, responsive images, and much more. Based on all those signals, they then need to somehow decide when to load which resources, to make optimal use of the modern HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 connections. And, as you might have guessed, none of the browsers do this in quite the same way (understatement alert!). Several even intentionally delay requesting some resources until others have been downloaded (<em>shocked face emoji here</em>). </p>\n<p>This talk is a deep dive into how browsers decide when to load a specific resource, and some ways in which you can influence them to modify their behaviour (so you can make sure that important LCP image is definitely one of the first things to come in!). We will look at A LOT of different waterfalls and discuss why each looks the way it does, why browsers often make different decisions, and how to solve common problems (no, don’t just preload everything with fetchpriority=high, you monster!).</p>\n<p>You will walk away with a deeper understanding of what happens under the hood, which will allow you to better deal with the various gotchas and quirks present in today’s browsers and resource loading features.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Scheduling problem arise in many subsystems such as the CPU scheduler, disk IO or Qdisc. Despite extensive research during several decades, this problem remain challenging to solve due to varying workload requirements, diversity of scheduled resources, latency versus throughput considerations, scheduler overhead and many others. For instance, the Linux CPU scheduler continues to evolve.</p>\n<p>In this talk, we’ll explore another scheduling scenario: HTTP streams prioritization. Having that a busy web server can manage millions of TCP connections, each potentially containing hundreds of HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 streams, a pretty efficient stream is essential. It should be fair, say, for progressive JPEGs, but it should prioritize shorter load times for PNG images. It should also be smart enough, particularly if browsers don’t adequately prioritize streams (which is still could be an issue for mainstream browsers in 2024). Additionally, it must be resilient against DDoS attacks.</p>\n<p>This talk will cover the following topics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The different nature of resources, their relationships, and how these factrors affect streams scheduling used for delivering these resources</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fair O(logN) and fast O(1) scheduling algorithms</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Discussions on underlying data structures to optimize the scheduler for a large number of streams</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>HTTP/2 streams prioritization in servers such as Nginx, H2O, nghttp2 (Envoy, Apache HTTPD) and Tempesta FW</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Differences between stream prioritization in HTTP/2 and HTTP/3, along with corresponding RFCs</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>How modern browsers construct stream priority trees</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Server-side optimizations for streams scheduling in Cloudflare and Tempesta FW</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Known vulnerabilities exploiting the HTTP/2 prioritization mechanisms</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

    "abstract": "<p>A dual-MAX2771 radiofrequency frontend fitted on a FX2LP parallel to USB interface is presented as an update to Tomoji Takasu's PocketSDR. Having understood the underlying operating principles of the FX2LP configured through its 8051 microcontroller core using the opensource sdcc compiler, we configure the MAX2771s to collect samples up to 44 MS/s in the L-band ranging from 1 to 2 GHz. We first demonstrate proper operation by collecting and decoding Iridium messages using gr-iridium, despite the 2 or 3-bit resolution of the IQ ADCs, before demonstrating post-processing and real time processing of GNSS data. Both real time data collection, processing and streaming using GNU Radio and GNSS signal decoding using gnss-sdr are demonstrated. Tomoji Takasu's PocketSDR software provides invaluable insight and our contribution is porting the firmware to sdcc to get rid of any proprietary tool for developing the PocketSDR-like board.</p>\n<p>The coherent multi-receiver architecture allows for processing the same L-band with two antennas for Controlled Radiation Pattern Antenna (CRPA) processing and detecting spoofing by inconsistent direction of arrival ; or processing two bands (e.g. L1/L5 or L1/L2) simultaneously.</p>\n<p>See https://github.com/jmfriedt/max2771_fx2lp/: the subject of this presentation was the core project of the opensource tools for embedded systems development ELISE Master teaching at University of Franche-Comté is Besançon, France.</p>",

I show benchmarks comparing GNU Radio 3.10, GNU Radio 4.0, FutureSDR, this new runtime, and a hand-written ad-hoc implementation, for a class of certain simple flowgraphs. These show that popular runtimes often have a high overhead and that there is much room for improvements in performance.

Graph compression techniques allow loading and manipulating such graphs into main memory of either high-end workstations or commercial-grade servers, depending on graph size. In this talk, we report about webgraph-rs, a recent clean-slate Rust re-implementation of WebGraph, a state-of-the-art graph compression framework, formerly implemented in Java. webgraph-rs comes as a series of interconnected Rust crates of general interest, including high-performance bit streams, zero-copy (de)serialization, constant-time measurement of heap size for large data structures, and high-performance implementation of succinct data structures . Using webgraph-rs one can load graphs such as the Software Heritage Merkle DAG (about 0.6 trillion edges ) in less than 200 GiB of RAM and visit it in a few hours with a single core.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Rust's references adhere to a strict \"one exclusive XOR many shared\" model, which gives the language much of its greatest safety guarantees. Reborrowing is a feature that seems on surface to break this rule: An exclusive reference can be turned into shared references and those shared references can be used together with the exclusive reference as long as these are all used as if they were shared references. Only once the exclusive reference is used as exclusive, all the derived or \"reborrowed\" shared references are invalidated. The XOR rule is upheld, but in a way that breaks a literal reading of the rule.</p>\n<p>Usually reborrowing is used temporarily but what if we make it our modus operandi? This talk explores using and slightly abusing reborrowing and comes out the other side with an awkward but functional safepoint garbage collector built upon reborrowing a ZST marker and a whole load of typed indexes. The garbage collector is part of the Nova JavaScript engine.</p>\n<p>https://trynova.dev/</p>",

Both from outside the Rust community: How to identify projects that could benefit from a rewrite? What do you need to do to get your Rust project accepted in a wider community? How do you get your project known? How do I get my project distributed? But also from inside the Rust community: Which crates do can I use as dependencies? What if my preferred crate name is already in use? Should I publish on crates.io? Do I offer a Rust interface for my crate?</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>In this talk, I will introduce <strong>Syd</strong>, a <a href=\"https://gitlab.exherbo.org/sydbox/sydbox/-/blob/main/COPYING\">GPL-3 licensed</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tigran_Petrosian\">rock-solid</a> application kernel designed for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbox_(computer_security)\">sandboxing</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software\">applications</a> on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux\">Linux</a> systems (version 5.19 and above). Over the past 16 years, Syd has evolved from a tool used within <a href=\"https://www.exherbolinux.org/\">Exherbo Linux</a> to detect package build mishaps into a robust security boundary for applications. The recent rewrite in <a href=\"https://www.rust-lang.org/\">Rust</a> leverages modern Linux APIs such as <a href=\"https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/seccomp_unotify.2.html\"><em>seccomp-unotify(2)</em></a>, <a href=\"https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/openat2.2.html\"><em>openat2(2)</em></a>, and <a href=\"https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/pidfd_getfd.2.html\"><em>pidfd_getfd(2)</em></a> to eliminate <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-of-check_to_time-of-use\">time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTTOU)</a> vulnerabilities, which is essential for building a secure sandbox.</p>\n<p>Syd aims to provide a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle\">simple interface</a> over complex Linux sandboxing mechanisms -- including <a href=\"https://landlock.io/\">Landlock LSM</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_namespaces\">namespaces</a>, <a href=\"https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/ptrace.2.html\"><em>ptrace(2)</em></a>, and <a href=\"https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/seccomp_unotify.2.html\">seccomp-BPF/Notify</a> -- which are often considered <a href=\"https://lwn.net/Articles/796108/\">brittle</a> and <a href=\"https://lwn.net/Articles/795128/\">difficult to use</a>. This approach is somewhat similar to <a href=\"https://www.openbsd.org/\">OpenBSD</a>'s <a href=\"https://man.openbsd.org/pledge.2\"><em>pledge</em>(2)</a> system call, offering a practical way to restrict application behavior. Unlike other sandboxing tools like <a href=\"https://falco.org/\">Falco</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/containers/bubblewrap\">Bubblewrap</a>, <a href=\"https://firejail.wordpress.com/\">Firejail</a>, <a href=\"https://gvisor.dev/\">gVisor</a>, and <a href=\"https://google.github.io/minijail/\">minijail</a>, Syd operates <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privilege_separation\">without requiring extra privileges</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setuid\">SETUID</a> binaries, or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privilege_(computing)\">privileged kernel context</a>. It adheres to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy\">UNIX philosophy</a> of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy#Do_One_Thing_and_Do_It_Well\">doing one thing well</a> with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege\">the least privilege</a> necessary.</p>\n<p>The presentation will cover Syd's key features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Path Sandboxing</strong>: Controls filesystem access through various operations including read, write (with append-only paths and path masking), stat (aka path hiding), tmpfile creation, attribute changes, truncation, node creation, file creation, and deletion.</li>\n<li><strong>Execution Control</strong>: Implements exec sandboxing with SegvGuard, force sandboxing for verified execution, and Trusted Path Execution to enforce strict execution policies.</li>\n<li><strong>Network Sandboxing</strong>: Restricts network access, supporting UNIX, IPv4, IPv6, Netlink, and KCAPI sockets, along with application firewalls and IP blocklists.</li>\n<li><strong>Advanced Features</strong>: Includes lock sandboxing using Landlock LSM, proxy sandboxing with network namespace isolation (defaulting to TOR), memory and PID sandboxing as simpler alternatives to control groups, SafeSetID for secure UID/GID transitions, and Ghost mode for enhanced process isolation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I will also discuss how Syd addresses common security challenges such as TOCTOU issues and side-channel attacks, aligning with a threat model similar to that of seccomp. Attendees will gain insights into the design and implementation of Syd, its practical applications in enhancing system security, and how it can be integrated into various environments -- including as a login shell -- to provide robust application isolation.</p>",

I'll start by discussing sq's design\nphilosophy.  In particular, I'll explain how sq aims to firstly be a\ntool for end users, and not developers writing scripts, and what that\nmeans for users of the tool.  I'll then present how sq is different\nfrom other tools in the ecosystem.  In this regard, one of the most\nimportant differences is that sq explicitly does not support curated\nkeyrings; users have to authenticate all of the certificates that they\nuse.  At first blush, this may sound like a usability nightmare, but\nI'll show how sq supports users by managing evidence, which simplifies\nthese decisions.  Finally, I'll demonstrate several workflows.  These\ninclude how to verify files, how to create and manage a certificate,\nhow to find a certificate and use it, and how to create and manage a\nCA for your organization.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>The infosec industry has seen a big growth in recent years, with a plethora of mostly closed-source solutions such as Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR), Security Information and Event Management (SIEM), and Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) marketed as indispensable tools for defending organizations. These solutions often emphasize protection against sophisticated adversaries, zero-day exploits, and malicious insiders. However, our real-world experience reveals that the majority of initial compromises occur through simpler approaches, such as stolen credentials and phishing attacks.</p>\n<p>In this talk, we introduce Buffalogs, an open-source solution designed to detect and alert on anomalous login behaviors. Adhering to the Unix philosophy of \"do one thing and do it well,\" Buffalogs offers a way to analyze common application logs (ssh, Apache, Microsoft Entra ID, etc) and detect credential misuse. Attendees will gain insights into the challenges of login anomaly detection, the development of Buffalogs and the differences between our solution and other commercial alternatives.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>What was the last npm package you installed?  Did anything unexpected happen?  Are you sure?</p>\n<p>The scale and pace of modern software development are made possible by the ready availability of open-source packages via major registries like npm and PyPI.  These registries are always within reach of developers thanks to command-line package managers like npm and pip, enabling rapid testing and deployment of third-party code as part of normal workflows.  However, these benefits come at the cost of particular security concerns: threat actors routinely target software developers via open-source package registries, either by publishing backdoored packages or by taking over and corrupting legitimate software. In many such supply-chain attacks, merely installing the malicious package is enough to hand control of one’s system over to the adversary.</p>\n<p>In this talk, we lay out the strategies that threat actors use when targeting software developers via open-source package registries.  We do so by examining case-studies in open-source malware delivery via npm and PyPI, some involving nation-state actors, that we at Datadog Security Research have collected while continuously monitoring these ecosystems with GuardDog, an open-source scanner for identifying malicious packages by analyzing code patterns and package metadata.  We then propose recommendations for developers, as well as for the package registries themselves, to counter these strategies that could lead to a greater overall level of software supply-chain security in the open-source community.</p>",

This talk will describe real-life scenarios of deploying quantum resistant and hybrid secure boot mechanisms on embedded systems.</p>\n<p>Initially designed in 2018 to implement secure boot on small microcontrollers (ARMv7 Cortex-M), wolfBoot has been then ported to several architectures including ARM Cortex-A, RISC-V, PowerPC, Renesas RX, and more recently it has been deployed in x86_64 as complete bios replacement with Intel FSP. On new ARMv8-M microcontrollers, it can supervise the secure domain and expose an interface to access cryptography from non-secure world.</p>\n<p>Based on RFC9019, wolfBoot only uses static memory and has a predictable execution flow at compile time, which makes it suitable to use in safety-critical environments. It relies on wolfCrypt for public key authentication. It offers protection against rollbacks and has some advanced unique features such as delta updates and mitigations against fault injections. </p>\n<p>After briefly introducing the project, the talk will focus on the urge to migrate new systems towards securing boot with quantum resistant algorithms in the next decade.\nWe will explore the mechanisms currently provided by wolfBoot to pair PQC (ML-DSA, LMS, XMSS) with classic cryptography (ECC, RSA, ED) to authenticate the signature of the firmware at boot and upon updates.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/wolfssl/wolfboot\">Repository on github</a></p>",

The BMC will starts from a network boot and load all required firmware (from PCIe end points, to microcontroller) from a trusted source before starting target. This approach is currently implemented on HPE Gen11 servers which supports Open Source Firmware. Our goal is to enhance security by decoupling the firmware and hardware supply chain, and allowing easier update process.</p>",

The kernel itself, on the other hand, has a large developer base, fast feature development, quick responses to vulnerabilities, and much better overall scrutiny. Our approach is to use the Linux kernel as its own boot loader in the form of a unified kernel image (UKI). Loaded by the EFI stub on UEFI, an UKI is made up of all the components needed to reach the final boot target: the kernel, initramfs, and kernel command line, in one signed bundle. All necessary drivers, filesystem support, and networking are already built in and code duplication is avoided. \nWe will describe the work and testing done so far and our approach to customization, as well as fallback, and hope for your feedback and use cases.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>TrenchBoot is an open source project led by 3mdeb, Apertus Solutions, and Oracle. It aims at the security and integrity of the boot process by leveraging advanced silicon security features, like Intel Trusted Execution Technology (TXT) and AMD Secure Startup. It integrates with open source projects like GRUB2, Xen, and Linux, to perform a measured launch of the operating system software, also called Dynamic Root of Trust for Measurement (DRTM).</p>\n<p>The presentation will provide an overview of the project's current status, emphasizing the key developments during the last year such as progress towards upstreaming patches in Linux and GRUB, as well as bringing UEFI support for Xen boot path.</p>",

There is obviously still a sheer amount of individual hardware devices, file systems, standard APIs and polished features that could be supported or implemented, but that is clearly a less rewarding endeavor for potential contributors than working on the major building blocks like before.</p>\n<p>Are there generic lessons to be learned from the story of HelenOS? Is every community-driven non-mainstream OS destined to end up in this \"serene valley\"? How do we plan to get out of it? The goal of this talk is to discuss these questions.</p>",

I will also shed some light on the challenges we face in maintaining these certifications while staying true to the open source nature of the system with contributions form a multitude of actors from various fields. I will conclude with an outlook of the things to come and how we want to ensure that open source microkernel-based operating systems can be a vital cornerstone to safe &amp; secure systems.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>We present a formal specification of NOVA that captures its complex concurrent and architectural behavior. Our specification combines an operational specification for unprivileged user code with a separation logic specification of privileged state and operations. The specification precisely captures the subtle behaviors of NOVA such as address translation and user faults. Separation logic’s small footprint and open world nature makes the specification highly modular and reasonably high level, allowing us to abstract architectural details that are encapsulated by NOVA and evolve the formal specification as NOVA evolves. Using the specification, we have carried out proofs of the NOVA source code as well as of applications running on top of NOVA.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>One of the most idiosyncratic parts of POSIX compliance is signal support. On microkernels the implementation can prove to be quite difficult. One especially tricky part is the cancellation of POSIX syscalls when they are interrupted by signals, and the intricacies of EINTR side effects. Monolithic kernels inheritely have the bookkeeping required to implement this without  extra overhead. In contrast, due to the generally distributed nature of microkernels, properly cancelling syscalls requires extra work. This is especially the case for Managarm, where (1) POSIX is implemented in a userspace server, (2) syscalls are asynchronous and (3) can involve multiple servers.</p>\n<p>In this talk, we will explore the process of implementing syscall cancellation on Managarm. A brief overview of signal delivery is given, followed by a deep dive into the new lifetime of a Managarm POSIX request. Finally, we give a summary of the lessons learned while implementing cancellation in a fully asynchronous microkernel.</p>",

DuckPGQ extends DuckDB’s capabilities to support graph processing, leveraging the property graph data model and implementing the SQL/PGQ standard. This enables users to query and analyze graph data within the familiar SQL environment. By harnessing DuckDB’s efficient in-memory architecture, DuckPGQ facilitates fast and seamless graph operations on tabular data and has been shown to outperform traditional graph databases like Neo4j on certain pattern matching queries. Additionally, DuckPGQ supports efficient execution of graph algorithms, enabling complex analytics such as PageRank and clustering operations. We’ll explore how DuckPGQ bridges the gap between relational and graph data, empowering users to perform pattern matching, path-finding, and more—all without needing specialized graph databases and from the convenience of your own laptop.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>In this talk, we share our journey in making QuestDB, an Apache 2.0-licensed open-source time-series database, a significantly faster analytical database. Over the course of just one year, we achieved query performance gains of up to 6x by implementing specialised data structures, SIMD-based optimisations, scalable aggregation algorithms, and parallel execution pipelines.</p>\n<p>QuestDB is designed for high-performance ingestion—processing millions of rows per second—and efficient queries over billions of rows. While it excelled in time-based queries, we found that certain generic analytical queries were slower than expected. In this session, we’ll walk through how we identified opportunities for improvement, the key changes we implemented, and how those changes delivered dramatic performance improvements in a relatively short timeframe.</p>\n<p>We’ll demonstrate before-and-after queries to showcase the impact of these optimisations. All the code is freely available in QuestDB's GitHub repository for anyone to explore or contribute to.</p>",

The difference being that ADBC's API is defined in terms of the <a href=\"https://arrow.apache.org\">Apache Arrow</a> in-memory columnar format.  Applications can code to this standard API much like they would for ODBC or JDBC, but fetch result sets in the Arrow format, avoiding transposition and conversion costs if possible.. </p>\n<p>This talk will cover goals, use-cases, and examples of using ADBC to communicate with different Data APIs (such as Snowflake, Flight SQL or postgres) with Arrow Native in-memory data.</p>",

Not to mention any other metadata that organizations need, fully supported through the meta parameter.</p>\n<p>At scale, with hundreds or thousands of data models, all this metadata can become confusing, disparate, and inconsistent.

It allows data teams to programmatically define and enforce metadata rules, in an easy and scalable manner.</p>\n<p>dbt-score is an open-source linter for dbt metadata. It is designed to be flexible to enforce and encourage any good practice set up by data teams.

In this context, developing custom visual graph exploration user interfaces can be key to providing business users with workable tools.</p>\n<p>I will present how to use <a href=\"https://sigmajs.org\">sigma.js</a>, an open-source JavaScript library for web-based network visualization, to write a dedicated web interface to explore data from <a href=\"https://ricardo.medialab.sciences-po.fr/\">RICardo</a>, an open-data research project mapping world trade in the 19th century.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Open source is more than just code—it is a philosophy, a movement, and a framework that touches every aspect of society. However, as open source grows, there is a risk of it becoming another siloed institution, disconnected from the very communities it seeks to serve, much like academia and corporate America. To ensure open source remains inclusive and impactful, we must actively involve local communities in the process of technological development.  </p>\n<p>This talk explores how regional OSPO (Open Source Program Office) networks can serve as catalysts for inclusive innovation by connecting local communities, tech meetups, academic institutions, and civic organizations. These networks create a framework to:<br />\n- Study problems affecting local communities.<br />\n- Develop open technologies tailored to address these issues.<br />\n- Implement solutions through open governance, ensuring transparency, equity, and sustainability.  </p>\n<p>By dedicating resources to both regional collaboration and local focus, regional OSPO networks strike a balance that drives large-scale innovation while staying grounded in the needs of diverse communities.  </p>\n<p>Key themes include:<br />\n- <strong>Open Source as a Societal Institution:</strong> Why open source must go beyond code and actively integrate with local communities to avoid becoming siloed.<br />\n- <strong>Regional Networks for Connection:</strong> How regional OSPO networks foster collaboration among civic institutions, academia, local communities, and the tech industry.<br />\n- <strong>Inclusive Technology Development:</strong> How to engage local voices to study problems, co-develop solutions, and ensure equitable implementation.<br />\n- <strong>The 20/80 Framework:</strong> A practical model for balancing local focus with regional collaboration to create resilient and impactful networks.  </p>\n<p>This session offers a vision for a new kind of open source ecosystem—one that connects society’s diverse sectors, tackles real-world problems, and builds a foundation for sustainable, community-driven innovation. Whether you’re a community leader, OSPO practitioner, or open source advocate, join us to explore how we can bridge the gap between open source ideals and societal impact.  </p>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong><br />\n- The importance of integrating local communities into open source development processes.<br />\n- How regional OSPO networks can address local challenges through collaborative innovation.<br />\n- Strategies for fostering open governance and inclusive technology development.  </p>\n<p>This talk is a call to action: let’s ensure open source remains a force for collective good, bringing all of society into the fold. Together, we can prevent open source from becoming another siloed institution and instead position it as a true bridge to a better future.</p>",

You’ll learn how this bias skews community perceptions, perpetuates systemic challenges, and limits opportunities.</p>\n<p>By examining barriers like unwelcoming dynamics, recruitment biases, and a lack of mentorship, you'll understand why many are deterred before or during their FOSS journeys. You'll also learn how survivorship bias interacts with intersectionality, compounding challenges for women of color, LGBTQ+ individuals, and others.</p>\n<p>We’ll also explore examples of communities and initiatives that successfully counter these trends, demonstrating allyship's role in building equitable environments.

    "abstract": "<p>My name is David Berman. I am an electrician by trade, not a programmer by profession, but I have ventured into the world of programming out of necessity and conviction. My journey into this realm has been fueled by a desire to challenge the prevailing norms of an industry heavily skewed toward proprietary, enterprise-oriented solutions. Specifically, I have worked to advocate for open-source, cost-effective methods to control city streetlights and other industrial control systems traditionally dominated by expensive and exclusive technologies.</p>\n<p>During my talk I would like to share my newest project, Gungnir:\nhttps://github.com/davidjrb/gungnir</p>\n<p>This journey has been far from easy. The resistance to change in this space is significant, and the challenges are both technical and cultural. One of the key barriers is the entrenched power of profit-driven opponents, including corporate lobbyists and those with vested interests in maintaining the status quo. These forces often stifle innovation and prevent the adoption of solutions that could benefit society as a whole by reducing costs and fostering collaboration.</p>\n<p>Another challenge comes from within the very community I advocate for. Despite the immense potential of open-source solutions, there is a tendency among many non-programmers—particularly those in traditional trades or management roles—to dismiss these solutions out of hand. This is often due to a lack of familiarity with the technology or misconceptions about its reliability and scalability. Bridging this gap requires not only technical expertise but also the ability to communicate the value and viability of open-source approaches in terms that resonate with a broader audience.</p>\n<p>In my talk, I aim to explore these challenges in depth, sharing insights from my own experience as a non-programmer navigating a highly technical field. I will discuss the hurdles faced by the open-source community when advocating for transparency, collaboration, and cost-efficiency in an industry often resistant to such ideals. I will also highlight strategies to foster greater acceptance and collaboration between open-source advocates and those unfamiliar with or skeptical of these technologies.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, my goal is to spark a dialogue about how we, as a community, can better advocate for open-source solutions in industrial and civic systems, ensuring that they are not only adopted but also embraced as a viable and beneficial alternative to proprietary models. By sharing stories, challenges, and strategies, I hope to inspire others—whether programmers, non-programmers, or industry professionals—to join this important movement.</p>\n<p>Thank you for having me. </p>\n<p>I look forward to seeing you all 14:00, Saturday, 1. February in Baudoux - UB5.230</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Since 2022, the <a href=\"https://ocf.tw/en/\">Open Culture Foundation (OCF)</a> has been collaborating with <a href=\"https://moda.gov.tw/en/\">Taiwan’s Ministry of Digital Affairs (MoDA)</a> and <a href=\"https://www.steps.com.tw\">STEPS (a local tech company)</a> on government-funded localization projects. These initiatives aim to make civic tech and open-source tools more accessible in Taiwan while enabling international projects to take root and thrive locally.</p>\n<p>As a coordinator, OCF has completely localized projects such as GOV.UK Notify, GOV.UK Forms, Matrix Client (Element Series), IRMA, Yivi, Standard for Public Code, Bitwarden, Nextcloud, FreeOTP, GIMP, and Mattermost. Some of these projects have been contributed back to their upstream repositories, while others have evolved into localized solutions tailored to Taiwan's needs. OCF’s efforts focus on three key areas to ensure government funding provides not only financial support but also a foundation for sustainable development.</p>\n<p><strong>This talk will explore these three main focus areas:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Optimizing the Government Perspective on Open Source</strong>\n    Educating government officials about the nature of open-source communities, their collaboration models, and the unique attributes of various international open-source projects. OCF also developed a collaborative glossary process to bridge communication gaps among stakeholders and ensure consistent terminology usage.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Collaboration Among Taiwan’s Communities</strong>\n    Partnering with Taiwan’s L10N community, OCF established structured review processes to meet the government’s high standards for quality and timeliness. Over three years, OCF conducted two major surveys during COSCUP. One survey identified critical open-source projects needed in Taiwan, while the other focused on addressing challenges that hinder contributions, aiming to encourage broader participation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Engagement with Local Industry and International Communities</strong>\n    Although Taiwanese tech teams are highly skilled, many are unfamiliar with the culture of open-source contributions. OCF facilitated understanding of licensing, contribution practices, and engagement with upstream communities. For example, OCF helped Mattermost report and resolve a date display bug in Chinese (CJK) scripts and worked with upstream communities to address significant differences between Simplified and Traditional Chinese, including grammar and linguistic nuances.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Localization is not merely about technical translation; it is a strategic approach to connecting governments, communities, and international open-source projects. This talk will share OCF’s experiences in bridging these gaps and invite Community DevRoom participants to exchange ideas on how to effectively integrate open-source projects into their respective countries.</p>",

Do you blindly copy and paste the governance of other projects hoping it works for your project too? Do you struggle to keep governance up to date or aligned with what’s actually going on in the project? You’re not alone.</p>\n<p>Secondly, we want to provide a simple, practical, and proven approach to writing governance that’s directly inspired from coding best practices. The very same concepts that are used when writing code (e.g. Don’t Repeat Yourself, Keep It Simple, or Separation of Concerns) have direct application when authoring governance documents and create the same kind of positive outcomes: governance that is simple to understand, flexible, and and easy to maintain. You’ll never come back from thinking about governance as code.</p>\n<p>By the time you leave this presentation, you’ll have an entirely new perspective on governance and will feel empowered by your ability to leverage your existing software engineering skills in this new domain.</p>",

However, true public goods require more than openness—they demand active community governance, collective stewardship, and responsible contributions to thrive as shared resources.</p>\n<p>While proprietary software sustains itself through licensing, support, and vendor lock-in, open-source software relies on a delicate balance of professional firms, organizational backing, and dedicated enthusiasts. The open model has fueled flexibility, innovation, and the global adoption of open technologies.</p>\n<p>Yet, the rapid growth of \"open\" has not been matched by an equivalent rise in contributions or investments in maintenance. Discussions often prioritize licensing over the essential question: How do we, as a community, ensure that digital public goods are sustainable? This talk explores the responsibility of contributors, organizations, and users in building a resilient ecosystem for open technologies.</p>",

In this talk, we'll trace the journey of generics in Go—from the early days of design discussions to their eventual implementation in Go 1.18. We'll cover the challenges that led to Go's unique approach to generics, the technical design decisions involved, and how they were implemented to balance simplicity with powerful functionality. Attendees will gain a deeper understanding of the compiler magic that makes Go generics possible and explore practical examples of how generics enhance type safety and flexibility without sacrificing Go's performance and readability principles. This talk is ideal for anyone curious about how generics work under the hood and what they mean for the future of Go.</p>",

    "abstract": "<h2>Motivation</h2>\n<p>Computer Science curriculums often focus on theoretical lessons, such as how garbage collection (GC) works under the hood or the trade-offs between different GC designs. However, there is much less emphasis on how to write GC-aware code in languages like Go. This is surprising since most of these practices are language-agnostic.</p>\n<p>This is a significant gap, especially given GC's impact on application performance. Profiling data from real-world applications consistently shows that a considerable amount of time is spent on memory allocation and GC-related activities.</p>\n<p>This talk will be a practical session on writing memory-efficient code, supported by an understanding of Go's garbage collection and memory allocation internals.</p>\n<h2>The talk</h2>\n<h3>Introduction</h3>\n<p>I will begin by discussing the motivation behind this talk and explaining why this topic is crucial, backed by empirical profiling data from real-world applications.</p>\n<h3>Essentials</h3>\n<p>Next, I’ll provide a high-level overview (a 10,000-foot view) of stack, heap, and GC concepts. This segment will be brief but necessary to establish a foundational understanding. </p>\n<h3>Main</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Walk through real code examples and demonstrate techniques for writing memory-efficient Go code, such as avoiding pointers, preventing overallocation of slices, minimizing the overuse of interfaces and generics and many more, clarify misconceptions about sync.Pool and leverage it effectively.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Short  Overview of Go's standard tooling for observing memory usage and GC behavior: memory profiler, benchmarking tools, escape analysis, GC configuration, execution tracer. Shed more light on less known/used tools like execution tracer. </p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Finish</h3>\n<p>Finish the talk by emphasizing that writing allocation-friendly code is crucial for maintaining application performance and should not be overlooked and a wrap-up.</p>",

The work needed to get this done was actually pretty simple thanks to other projects like <a href=\"https://github.com/containers/skopeo\">skopeo</a> and <a href=\"https://umo.ci/\">umoci</a> which Incus leverages to handle the OCI images.</p>\n<p>In this presentation, we'll be looking at why we wanted to add OCI containers to Incus in the first place, how it was implemented, some of the differences from other implementations and what's planned next to make this even more useful.</p>",

In the current state of things, host networking is one huge imperative nightmare. So how to happily marry an old-school Network Manager and brand new Kubernetes API?</p>\n<p>Over the years we were working on the NMstate project to provide you with a Declarative Network API, allowing you to manage host networking in a declarative manner.</p>\n<p>In 2025 we are coming back with brand new features. Based on the feedback, we focused on air-gapped and big clusters – think hundreds of nodes with hundreds of VLANs each. We also happily married K8s and KubeVirt – no matter what your workload is, containers or VMs, NMstate is there for you.</p>\n<p>Not only a project update – we will also show you how the Kubernetes cluster with NMState Operator manages networking on the nodes it deploys. It may sound like a chicken and egg situation, but trust us, it is not.

What’s the recommended way to run a fully autonomous application with several interacting containers in these cases?</p>\n<p>The answer is systemd. It can orchestrate containers as is an already running process manager, and containers are just child processes. It’s a perfect fit for running containerized workloads without human intervention.</p>\n<p>The concept of Quadlet has been introduced in Podman v4.4.0. It’s a <a href=\"https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.generator.html\">systemd-generator</a> that writes and maintains systemd services using <a href=\"https://github.com/containers/podman\">Podman</a>. It can manage containers lifecycle (start, stop, restart), volumes, pods, deployments etc. via systemd. The name comes from the following: “What do you get if you squash a Kubernetes kubelet? A quadlet”. Both system and user systemd units are supported to deploy applications without root privileges.</p>\n<p>In this presentation, we will discuss what are <a href=\"https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-systemd.unit.5.html\">Podman Quadlets</a> and demonstrate how <a href=\"https://docs.podman.io/en/v4.2/markdown/podman-play-kube.1.html\">Podman Kubernetes features</a> can be associated with it to deploy a fully autonomous application.</p>",

These include substantial overhead, resulting in larger, less efficient deployments and startup times, and a dependency on the underlying OS for security, posing potential vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p>WebAssembly (Wasm) addresses these challenges, and this talk will introduce the open-source project Boxer (https://boxer.dev), which offers tooling for taking existing containerized workloads and definitions, and creating near-universally deployable Wasm distributions (“Boxes”) offering roughly the same environment, with all the benefits of the WebAssembly target. Wasm, a compact binary instruction format, enables lightweight, sandboxed execution, significantly reducing overhead compared to traditional containers. This leads to enhanced performance and smaller, more efficient deployments, ideal for cloud computing. Additionally, Wasm's memory-safe, isolated execution environment provides superior security, independent of the OS. Thus, Wasm, with its blend of efficiency and security, emerges as not just an alternative, but a substantial improvement over container technology for cloud deployments.</p>\n<p>Marcotte (https://github.com/dphilla/marcotte) -- the underlying tool for virtualizing layers of system functionality -- allows us to make safe, sandboxed, discrete, and composable system functionality, by leveraging Rust's memory safety model, and the inherent properties of WebAssembly.</p>\n<p>This talk will critically examine this new technology, its approach, benefits, and existing limitations compared with containers, and its path forward as a new standard in cloud infrastructure.</p>",

Syd-OCI seamlessly integrates the advanced sandboxing capabilities of Syd -- our rock-solid application kernel designed for sandboxing applications -- into containerized environments by leveraging Youki, a modern container runtime written in Rust.</p>\n<p>Syd-OCI operates as a thin wrapper around Youki, utilizing Youki's robust OCI implementation while replacing its default executor with a custom one that runs container processes under Syd's comprehensive sandboxing framework. This integration allows Syd-OCI to provide enhanced security features -- such as Path Sandboxing, Execution Control with SegvGuard, Network Sandboxing, and advanced mechanisms like Lock Sandboxing and Proxy Sandboxing -- within standard OCI-compliant containers.</p>\n<p>The presentation will cover Syd-OCI's key features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Integration of Syd and Youki</strong>: How Syd-OCI combines Syd's advanced sandboxing mechanisms with Youki's efficient OCI runtime, creating a secure container runtime without requiring extra privileges, SETUID binaries, or privileged kernel context.</li>\n<li><strong>Technical Architecture</strong>: An in-depth look at how Syd-OCI replaces Youki's default executor with a custom executor that runs commands under Syd, enabling seamless integration of Syd's security features into container workflows.</li>\n<li><strong>Configuration and Usage</strong>: Guidance on setting up Syd-OCI with container platforms like Docker, Podman, and CRI-O, including configuring the Syd sandbox using profiles and integrating sandbox configurations into container images.</li>\n<li><strong>Advanced Sandboxing and Verified Images</strong>: Showcasing practical use cases where Syd-OCI enhances container security through advanced features like Force Sandboxing for verified execution and Crypt Sandboxing for transparent file encryption using AES-CTR. We will explore how these mechanisms provide integrity verification for container images and binaries, ensuring that only trusted and securely encrypted code is executed within containers, thereby strengthening protection against unauthorized modification and data breach.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Attendees will gain insights into the design and implementation of Syd-OCI, understanding how the integration of Syd and Youki provides a secure, efficient, and practical solution for container security. This talk will illustrate how Syd-OCI can be seamlessly integrated into existing container workflows, enhancing security without compromising performance or compatibility, and adhering to the UNIX philosophy of doing one thing well with the least privilege necessary.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Containers have become the preferred solution for cloud-native applications due to their lightweight nature and scalability. However, their security limitations, particularly from shared kernel access, have led to a renewed interest in traditional VMs for stronger isolation. Technologies like kata-containers enhance security by running containers inside microVMs, offering better isolation, but they introduce complexity and overhead. Specifically, the container runtimes spawn additional processes to manage the container within the VM, adding extra layers of complexity and resource consumption.</p>\n<p>This talk examines the pros and cons of sandboxed container runtimes, focusing on the added complexity of auxiliary processes. It then proposes a more efficient and streamlined approach based on the unikernel paradigm, where only the application and its dependencies are running. Rather than using strict unikernels, it explores how containers can run inside specialized, stripped-down Linux VMs, containing only the components required by the application and without additional services. This is achieved through urunc, a CRI-compatible container runtime that treats unikernels like standard containers, managing the user application via the VM process.</p>",

Even if you don’t use gVisor or are not interested in it, we’ll show some easy ways to harden your security-sensitive containers right now, for harm reduction purposes.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Container images sometimes take tens to hundreds of megabytes in size and require many network resources to be transferred.\nEspecially in low-bandwidth network environments like edge computing, frequent image updating will be difficult and increase the network cost.\nIn this talk, I will present \"D4C\", a software that provides faster and lighter image updating with delta encodings.\nDelta encodings reduce data size, but generating and applying deltas is a time-consuming operation.\nD4C utilizes some techniques to reduce them including merge-based delta management and applying deltas lazily.\nD4C reduces the data size to update images by up to 95% and provides about 10x faster updating in low-bandwidth networks than the state-of-the-art approach.\nBenchmarks with PostgreSQL and PyTorch showed that their performance degradation caused by D4C is negligible.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>TuxWrangler is a framework designed to simplify the creation and management sets of containers, focusing on automation, scalability, and flexibility. Unlike Packer, which excels at building single \"golden images\" for immutable infrastructure, TuxWrangler is tailored for environments requiring multiple lightweight, highly-configured images, such as GEICO's. It automates dependency updates by dynamically fetching and locking versions from container repositories, reducing manual effort and ensuring consistency. With its centralized configuration management and integration with CI/CD pipelines, TuxWrangler streamlines complex workflows, automates testing, and publishes validated images efficiently.</p>\n<p>TuxWrangler addresses use cases requiring dynamic updates and multiple image variations without duplicated build logic. Its ability to manage dependencies dynamically, scale configurations efficiently, and integrate seamlessly with DevOps ecosystems makes it ideal for modern, fast-paced environments. </p>\n<p>We will present a demo of TuxWrangler, which is currently being used by us to solve our engineering needs. We will focus on its ability to simplify multi-image builds, automate dependency management, and integrate seamlessly with existing workflows. We would like to receive feedback from the community regarding its future iterations, ensuring TuxBake remains a valuable tool for evolving infrastructure needs.</p>",

How these objectives are reached might differ too, e.g. while respecting instances’ bandwidth, one’s own as well as others’ privacy, algorithm trustworthiness and software licenses.\nThis talk introduces <a href=\"https://github.com/aittalam/byota\">an approach to personal, local timeline algorithms</a> that people can either run out-of-the-box or customize.

    "abstract": "<p><a href=\"https://github.com/ckolderup/postmarks\">Postmarks</a> is a piece of Fediverse software meant to provide a social bookmarking platform along the lines of De.licio.us and its successors. Despite the published ActivityPub spec having in mind a variety of verbs and nouns, and the ability to create \"extensions\", most software that I found while looking around in the early days of Postmarks looked to be recreating \"timeline-based social media\", where the primary activity took place on the platform itself and involved reading content from other users and generating more content of the same expectations. This is not to say there are none, but how much they expect to integrate with platforms like Mastodon varies.</p>\n<p>When thinking about what that meant for Postmarks, deciding how interoperability should work presents some interesting questions. There are opportunities in interoperability: even if you're not the kind of person to whom the activity of bookmarking and curating links is interesting, you may know someone who does whose work you want to follow, which you can then do from Mastodon. On the flipside, you may be a researcher who spends time collecting information and values the viewpoints of others but doesn't want to take part in a product designed like a traditional social media site. There are also drawbacks: as an individual maintainer with a handful of contributors to my platform, integrating with existing platforms that are already large enough to have abusers, scrapers, and other bad actors opens me up to those problems much sooner than it would if I were creating my own siloed ecosystem. Less urgently, there are new software design questions raised by the functionality of the platforms interacting. How do I make Postmarks content appear on platforms like Mastodon? As I build out the ability to find bookmarkable content from the Fediverse within Postmarks, how do I do that in a way that keeps in mind the ideals of Postmarks rather than the spaces it's connecting to? What choices have been made that add extra requirements on top of the ActivityPub spec in order to make interoperability smooth and consistent? In designing a piece of ActivityPub software designed to have one small \"instance\" that hosts the activity of one \"actor\", I also found myself stumbling across design decisions made in the creation of large platforms like Mastodon and Pixelfed that left me with questions about the ethics of designing software that can interact with those places. How do I prevent my software from becoming a tool for bad actors targeting those places?</p>\n<p>By looking at the design problems introduced within the early development of Postmarks and an analysis of other ActivityPub platforms that have either dealt with, are still working on, or have not faced these questions, we can create space for discussing what a future looks like where a broad variety of ActivityPub software is out on the internet speaking the same protocol but choosing when and how they interact in a way that cultivates communication and works to minimize harm.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>ActivityPub remains, to this day, the most successful decentralized social networking platform to date: dozens of interoperable implementations, thousands of servers, millions of users, all speaking over the same protocol in what's today called the \"fediverse\" (federated social web).  The modern-day fediverse is an impressive achievement, but it also leaves many issues to be addressed.  Servers can go down, content can disappear and users can lose access to their identity.  Authorization mechanisms are under-specified and rich interactions are fairly limited.  This talk, by the two primary editors of the ActivityPub specification, explores where we think the fediverse should go and how we're building a future for \"secure collaboration\" technology at the Spritely Institute.</p>",

Traditional testing methods often struggle to meet the demands of these systems, particularly when operating on resource-sharing architectures running complex operating systems like Linux. To address this challenge, we introduce Statistical Path Coverage (SPC), a novel statistical approach designed to enhance test effectiveness by statistically focusing on the execution paths exercised by target applications.</p>\n<p>This presentation will discuss how SPC can quantify execution path coverage, estimate the risk of untested paths, and support assurance. We will also introduce DB4SIL, a tool leveraging FTrace to collect and analyze execution traces, enabling actionable insights into the kernel’s behavior during testing campaigns. Through examples, we will demonstrate how SPC and DB4SIL can guide developers in prioritizing testing efforts, improving test coverage, enabling continuous monitoring, and reducing risk in complex, software-driven systems.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Many of the international standards for software in critical systems (e.g. IEC 61508, ISO 26262) are published under restrictive licences, at high prices. They broadly discourage the use of FOSS, by imposition of processes that do not align with modern open source best practices such as continuous delivery and automated testing. As a result some industries such as automotive, medical and aerospace, are locked in to proprietary software.</p>\n<p>This talk will introduce the Trustable Software Framework (TSF), a new free and open source project which establishes an evidence-based method for measuring the actual risks involved in continuous delivery of software in critical systems.</p>\n<p>TSF is applicable over the entire software supply chain, including CICD tools and infrastructure, build dependencies, operating systems, target applications and test environments, and is intended to measure risk on projects delivering critical systems which demand reliability, availability, security and safety.</p>",

Prevent them from being scheduled onto the CPU? And the best part: Without the application being able to prevent this, like it could do with POSIX STOP and START signals?\nIn come the scheduler extensions for the Linux Kernel. Introduced in version 6.12, they allow you to quickly write your own schedulers with eBPF, and can be the base for simple libraries that enable you to start and stop threads directly in the Linux kernel. This opens the possibility of creating complex scheduler scenarios at a whim.</p>\n<p>In this talk, we'll show you a prototypical sched_ext-based library for concurrency testing.</p>",

This is especially the sad reality when running end-to-end tests where a lot of components are involved. There are various reasons why a test can be flaky, however the impact can be as fatal as CI being loaded beyond capacity causing overly long feedback cycles or even users losing trust in CI itself.</p>\n<p>Ideally we want potential flakes to be flagged at the earliest stage of the development lifecycle, so that they do not even enter the end-to-end test suite. We want a gate that acts as a safeguard for developers, pointing out to them what kind of stability issues a test has. This reduces CI user frustration and improves trust in CI. At the same time it cuts down on unnecessary waste of CI system resources.</p>\n<p>This talk will explore the <a href=\"https://github.com/flake-it/cannier-framework/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#cannier-framework\">CANNIER</a> approach, which aims to reduce the time cost of rerunning tests. We will take a closer look at the feature set used to create training data from existing test code of the <a href=\"https://kubevirt.io/\">KubeVirt</a> project, enabling us to predict probable flakiness of a certain test with an AI model.  </p>\n<p>We will cover how a subset of the CANNIER feature set is implemented, how it is used to generate training data for an AI model, and how the model is used to analyze flakiness probability, generating actionable feedback for test authors. </p>\n<p>Attendees will gain insight on how the CANNIER approach can help them improve test reliability, ultimately enhancing overall software quality and team productivity.</p>",

This reliance often creates a bottleneck, as testing teams are restricted from modifying infrastructure directly, limiting their ability to adapt environments dynamically to meet specific testing requirements.</p>\n<p>In this talk, we will demonstrate how Molecule, an open-source testing tool, provides a robust framework for overcoming these challenges. By decoupling test environment management from pre-configured nodes, Molecule empowers testing teams to independently define and execute their tests across multiple environments. We’ll discuss how this approach integrates seamlessly with Jenkins pipelines and supports both legacy and modern testing frameworks.</p>\n<p>Attendees will learn how to use Molecule to reduce infrastructure dependencies, streamline testing workflows, and increase flexibility in testing.</p>",

This way, the software product gets delivered faster and more reliably to customers. This paper focuses on different techniques that have shortened the release cycle of the Kuiper Linux distribution. \nThe new release process involves creating a stabilization branch from main which is dedicated to the new release.  Previously, the software components were built and installed during the image creation. Now they are released independently as Debian packages which are uploaded on Analog Devices' Linux Package Repository. This is an easy, user-friendly method that facilitates the distribution and installation of ADI software packages. Each software component has its own release cycle so that one component's bugs won't affect the other components' release. \nThe software components are tested both separately and integrated into the Kuiper image. The latter required creating a Kuiper Docker image. This ensures that each software component is compatible with the target system as early as possible in the development process.</p>",

It’s designed to hide the complexity of <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/\">Kubernetes</a> so teams can focus on getting their apps running without needing to understand Kubernetes itself.</p>\n<p>When we deploy updates to applications, we usually use a simple method where old versions are replaced with new ones, one by one, over a short time. This works fine most of the time, but if the new version has bugs—causing slower performance or errors for users—this method doesn’t have a built-in way to catch those problems early or quickly switch back to the previous version.</p>\n<p>To solve this, we’ve added safer deployment strategies like <em>canary</em> and <em>A/B testing</em>. These allow us to release updates more cautiously by directing only a small percentage of user traffic to the new version first. If everything looks good, we slowly increase the traffic. If not, we can automatically roll back quickly.</p>\n<p>We achieved this by using tools like the <a href=\"https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/\">Kubernetes Gateway API</a>, <a href=\"https://www.envoyproxy.io/\">Envoy proxy</a>, and <a href=\"https://istio.io/\">Istio</a> to manage and control how traffic flows between different versions of an app. These tools work together to create a \"service mesh,\" which helps us balance traffic and make deployment smoother and safer.</p>\n<p>In this talk, we’ll share what we learned while setting this up and how it’s helping us ensure more reliable application updates at DigitalOcean.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Over the last fifteen years, we have drifted from a nearly fully FOSS suite of community tools to primarily proprietary ones.  Most developers lament the outcome, but the classic \"convenience factor\" of proprietary software has returned with a vengeance.  Rarely is this issue discussed, and virtually no one is planning next steps for transition away from the proprietary development infrastructure technologies.\nIndeed, the culmination of our shared, learned history in this community is the tools we use to develop our software should, themselves, also be Open Source and Free Software.  We survived the proprietarization &amp; ad-banner-infestation of Sourceforge.  We escaped the proprietary licensing regime of BitKeeper &amp; wrote replacements (Git &amp; Mercurial). Many lessons were learned.\nToday, however, FOSS projects rely more than ever on partly or wholly proprietary tools, such as GitHub, Slack, Jira, Groups.io &amp; the like. Even worse, GitHub has become a \"hub\" for sale of third-party proprietary bots, yielding even more reliance on proprietary technology by FOSS developers.\nThis talk is for anyone who works as a developer, community manager, organizer or collaborator in a FOSS project.  Nearly every FOSS project today includes a piece of proprietary infrastructure, and often contributors don't even realize what parts of their infrastructure are proprietary.\nThose who forget the past are condemned to repeat it.  This talk is a step in the direction of remembering the past to prevent that repetition which currently seems inevitable.\nThis talk surveys how bad the situation has become, what we can learn from our prior community interactions with proprietary systems and discusses how we can organize to begin solving this problem yet again.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Apple is one of the largest and most powerful companies in the world. Its unbalanced power spans over software and devices, trapping end-users and developers in tight lock-ins. This approach has prevented Free Software to flourish in environments controlled by Apple.</p>\n<p>The EU has reacted to Apple's monopolistic practices by passing the Digital Markets Act - a law containing several anti-monopoly obligations against big tech. By designating Apple as a \"gatekeeper\" of digital markets in the EU, the DMA, the company has now to comply with several rules regarding sideloading, enabling of alternative app stores and interoperability of its operating systems.  Apple has put forward an aggressive policy against the DMA. The company started litigation against the Euopean Commission to dodge DMA obligations.  </p>\n<p>Due to the high risks against software freedom, the FSFE was granted right to intervene in the case. By demonstrating that Apple is being regulated in light of public interest, the FSFE is proving to the court that interoperability and software freedom are compatible with human rights. </p>\n<p>This talk will explain why this court case is pivotal for Free Software in Europe. In case the FSFE succeeds, Free Software developers will enjoy higher degrees of software freedom in Apple devices. They will also enjoy better access and interoperability by being able to demand effective and free-of-charge interoperability between their software and Apple’s software and hardware.</p>",

At that point in time, the Next Generation Internet initiative was just about to get started. The report laid out a practical vision for what such an initiative could aim to become - based on input from a consultation by the authors across the European tech and digital rights community.</p>\n<p>At the time Europe had made some inroads on tech regulation, but was nowhere in terms of untangling its own technical debt. The hope was for NGI to put at least some public funding to work to make technology more human centric and develop concrete FOSS alternatives. Just a few years before, the vast threats to our privacy and security had been painfully highlighted by the revelations of whistleblower Edward Snowden.</p>\n<p>The unspoken ambition for NGI was to start reducing Europe's dangerous dependency on big tech companies running dark code in foreign jurisdictions. The report defined a number of strategic objectives and considerations, centered around user empowerment - and with an underlying ambition to improve our digital sovereignty and create the technology stack we want.</p>\n<p>So, now it is 2025. So where do we stand? In this talk, Michiel Leenaars, project lead and co-author of the original \"Next Generation Internet 2025\" study, will look back on how the Next Generation Internet initiative worked out so far - and where it can and should go next. With hundreds of thousands of developer hours funded across all layers of technology through programmes like <a href=\"https://nlnet.nl/NGI0\">NGI Zero</a>, the Next Generation Internet has pushed technological sovereignty more than any other EC supported effort. <em>Check.</em> Hundreds of projects ranging from free and open source videoconferencing, open social media, libre chip technology, productivity tools, post-quantum cryptography, tools to improve the software supply chain, podcasting and many more have been spawned - making it one of the largest FOSS programmes ever to exist. <em>Check.</em> An impressive amount of pretty <a href=\"https://nlnet.nl/hex\">hex stickers</a> now adorns the laptops of many European software developers and their kids, making them the nicest looking hackers on the planet. <em>Check.</em> The Next Generation Internet it seems has delivered, but so far is not included in the European Commissions plan's for future programmes. <em>Erm?</em></p>\n<p>Our problematic technological entanglement isn't solved yet, in fact: the situation is arguably more dire than ever. The geopolitical climate calls for technological disentanglement and a strategic move to free and open source software and digital commons, but what concrete steps are taken in Europe at the decision level? An embarrasing low came from the European Commission itself, as it is now <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:C_202403925\">suing its own data protection supervisor</a>, after it was <a href=\"https://www.edps.europa.eu/press-publications/press-news/press-releases/2024/european-commissions-use-microsoft-365-infringes-data-protection-law-eu-institutions-and-bodies\">concluded that the current use of Microsoft Office 365 isn't according to European legislation</a> - and so the EC should not be using that expensive, insecure and non-confidential cloud service. If you have to sue your own guardian angel because you cannot do without a digital typewriter and an app doing calculations on tabular data hosted on another continent, you are probably fairly desperate. So what should our new European Commissioner <a href=\"https://www.hennavirkkunen.fi/en/\">Henna Virkkunen</a>, executive vice-President for Tech Sovereignty, Security and Democracy be working on for the next five years of the '<a href=\"https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/europes-digital-decade-digital-targets-2030_en\">digital decade</a>'? Starting from the vantage point of the Next Generation Internet initiative in 2025, <strong>where do we go</strong>?</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>In many scenarios, such as community networks, the need to maximize the possible\ncommunication paths between nodes arises. In a classical AP-STA approach, it is\nnot possible to guarantee communication between all nodes in every scenario,\neven by resorting to very complex configurations.</p>\n<p>To overcome this issue, ad-hoc mode was used in the past, which solved the basic\nconnectivity problem. However, its implementation was not of high quality, and\nits design had significant flaws, which eventually led to it becoming\nunmaintained after a few years.\nLuckily, as ad-hoc mode became outdated, 802.11s emerged with some improvements.\nHowever, certain design choices—such as the complex methods for bridging other\nnetworks and routing between nodes—were fossilized into the standard, increasing\nWi-Fi driver complexity. This ultimately led to its silent demise.\nNew radio drivers and firmware do not support 802.11s well.\nNew Wi-Fi standards do not bring many improvements to 802.11s mesh mode,\nalthough they significantly improve AP-STA modes. Nonetheless, the need for\nnodes to communicate with anyone in range remains strong</p>\n<p>In this context, while searching for a modern solution,\nI began asking myself: is there a hard-to-resolve problem that prevents AP nodes\nin sight from communicating directly with each other?\nAfter discussing my ideas with Felix Fietkau (nbd), we agreed that it might be\npossible for AP nodes to communicate directly with each other. Since AP mode\nreceives the most support and improvements, we realized that with slight\nmodifications, we could enable all APs in range to communicate with one another.\nThis could solve a problem that has plagued Wi-Fi since its inception.\nWith a bit of luck and a lot of persistence, I demonstrated that seamless AP-AP\ncommunication is possible by modifying the hostapd code, without requiring any\nkernel or driver changes.</p>\n<p>Within a few months, this interesting experiment evolved into a new mode named\nAPuP, now included by default in both OpenWrt and DD-WRT. It opens a new rabbit\nhole that could make Wi-Fi development and usage exciting again, potentially\nrendering Ad-Hoc, WDS, 802.11s, Multi-AP, Wi-Fi Direct, and EasyMesh obsolete.</p>\n<p>Let’s embark on a journey through this code, and then we’ll have even more fun\ndigging together 🕳️🐇⏰.</p>\n<p>https://openwrt.org/\nhttps://gitlab.com/g10h4ck/hostap/-/commit/6bb15f81e6857989c0b722fc1a49275492114148</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>In december 2023, Loïc, Thibault and Marc embarked on a journey to convert a 2007 VW Polo into an EV using only off the shelve components such as Raspberry pis and Arduinos. Today, the car is drivable, and can even be controlled remotely. The entire software they wrote for it is open source and built using Elixir, a language running on the Erlang Virtual Machine (the BEAM). Their platform uses CAN communication to serve as a gateway and translate messages from the different components they used for their project (A nissan Leaf motor, a Tesla brake booster, and more...). In this talk, they will drive you through the process they went through to get to a fully working car and give some insights on how they made everything work together.</p>",

The first part of this design has taken shape as “MessageFormat 2”.</p>\n<p>What is MessageFormat 2 like? How does it approach the vast problem space and how exactly could it be adopted across various user interfaces? What further tools and standards are already being developed on top of it?

It is the very first success criteria in WCAG - SC 1.1.1: Non-text Content (Level A). It is so simple, yet it isn't. Despite all the guidance, including presentations like this one, folks get it wrong, over and over again. A lot can be done through using approaches like those recommended in the Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) 2.0. Clearly, authors need support. </p>\n<p>This presentation will cover a bit of this theory, but also highlight a simple Python script that I wrote to crawl a website so that we can more easily examine the alternative text that is provided. I'll quickly walk through the script, and then look at some of the more entertaining alt-text which is sitting on public government websites. </p>\n<p>It is worth noting that there is no automated tool that presently does much more than check that there is alt-text on an image. This clearly isn't sufficient to determining if the meaning of the image is represented in that alt text.</p>",

Many designers meanwhile know of design accessibility and may even recognize the growing need to ensure design that is accessible to people with disabilities. Yet how to address accessibility across FOSS tools and applications is commonly not well understood, and there are often sensitivities and myths. For example, does security of tools exclude accessibility? How can a single design achieve both priorities? This includes the design of standards, polices, applications, and basically all open-source digital technologies which unfortunately commonly misses accessibility and the involvement of people with disabilities. The talk will raise hard questions about intersectionality approaches for inclusive design within the FOSS ecosystem. </p>\n<p>This session will attempt to map out some of the interfaces between different disciplines and what each can bring to a shared table of requirements, including accessibility, security, user experience design, usability, and more.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>This talk explores an unexpected connection between open source and piracy(intellectual property piracy)—two concepts often seen as opposites. While intellectual property laws are meant to protect innovation, they also create barriers, especially for underdeveloped nations, by restricting access to essential knowledge and resources. It deepens global inequalities and limit opportunities for creativity and growth.</p>\n<p>To illustrate this, I will introduce China’s Shanzhai culture. Shanzhai is a Chinese term used to describe counterfeit, parody and it becomes a subculture known for creating knockoffs and bootlegs. Despite its controversial start, Shanzhai companies began developing their own innovative designs by responding to market needs. Over time, as China experienced rapid economic and technological growth, the country transitioned from the Shanzhai phase to a more innovation-driven future. Today, China ranks 11th in the Global Innovation Index, making it the only middle-income economy in the top 30 for 2024.</p>\n<p>Like piracy, open source challenges traditional ownership models, but it offers a more inclusive and ethical way forward. By sharing tools, ideas, and technology openly, we break down barriers, foster collaboration, and build a creative ecosystem that includes everyone. This talk invites you to rethink how we approach intellectual property, innovation, and the future of creativity.</p>",

Despite this, there is always the danger of accidentally creating deceptive designs that steer users into choices harmful to them - aka dark patterns. We could help them with open designs by creating fair patterns, but where do we even start?</p>\n<p>In the last years, I have studied and talked with different populations that are affected by these designs, and professional UX/UI designers that face the challenges related to deceptive designs. A repository of \"fair patterns\" or \"bright patterns\" as opposed to manipulative design is a necessary tool to mitigate these harmful designs, but the burden of creating these is very high. Open source design presents as a key to creating these patterns. In this talk, I will address the main problems that UX/UI designers face in the context of manipulative designs and discuss some unexpected challenges and potential solutions. With this I help the open source design community in creating more ethical interfaces with free-fair patterns: free from these deceptive patterns, free to use, and fair for all.</p>",

Most liquidsoap streams need to be produced in real-time and can dynamically switch from one stream to the next.</p>\n<p>This results in added complexity with regard to stream description: how to make sure that abstract content is generated in real-time (e.g. 2s of content is generated in 2s, slowing down the application if needed), how to maintain DTS/PTS consistency when switching from one stream to the next, etc.</p>\n<p>In this talk, we will present the challenges and solutions that are currently implemented in liquidsoap and explain the kind of abstract content API we hope to see emerging in the future to support the next generation of media streaming application.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>One of MistServer's (an open source media server) core features is the inherent resilience of handling each connection in a separate process. However, this was not possible for SRT connections using libsrt, since it manages its own sockets as an internal resource. Because of this, for years, MistServer's implementation of SRT used a single process for all connections combined: unlike other protocols in the system! The alternatives would be to either fork libsrt (or hope to upstream some pretty drastic changes) or build an entire alternative library from scratch... Or is a there a secret third option..? Spoiler: there is!</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>In 2024, we presented our open-source project that opens browser support to a variety of formats. This project introduces a new HTML5 syntax designed to create dynamic media pipelines for use cases related to media content handling. It leverages several technologies, including WebAssembly, Emscripten, Web Components, and GPAC. Together, these tools enable dynamic support for data formats not natively supported by browsers. This enables the option of display of data in legacy formats and promotes the development of new formats without relying on browsers to supply native support and without relying on generation and maintenance of browser plugins. </p>\n<p>The proposed HTML5 syntax is intuitive and flexible, catering both to novice web designers and professional developers within the open-source community who want to ensure that media content is accessible across all browsers. However, creating new decoders and integrating into the underlying GPAC media filter framework can be challenging for developers unfamiliar with WebAssembly and GPAC’s framework. </p>\n<p>To address this, alongside the player and SDK, we have updated our Visual Studio Code extension to streamline the development and integration of custom media decoders. The extension is now fully integrated with GitHub repositories, enabling users to retrieve, modify, compile, and test WebAssembly decoders directly. Additionally, we have released a new set of license-free decoders covering various use cases, including documents, images, audio, and video.</p>\n<p>Our visual studio code extension is available at the following URL :\nhttps://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Bevara.bevara-access</p>\n<p>This project is open to contributions. Below are the links to our repositories:\n•   Filters Repository: Contains all license-free media filters that can be integrated “as is“ into web pages or modified.\n•   Solver Repository: The fundamental glue component that enables the dynamic building of media filters within web pages.\n•   Player Repository: Provides the SDK and tools for compiling media filters locally.</p>\n<p>By encouraging the use of public forks on open projects—which require making derived projects public—we aim to foster a growing repository of freely available decoders for the community to use and build upon.</p>",

Microsoft recently expressed this idea, writing, “It would have been wonderful to see financial goals of maintainers on their sponsor's pages, as well as other types of sustainability ‘asks.’” They wanted this feedback to better assess who to give money to and how much.</p>\n<p>As part of this talk, the audience will be invited into a conversation about the support that maintainers need.

In 2022, following a funding crisis that nearly jeopardized the project, we developed a Sustainability Plan aimed at diversifying funding sources and reducing our dependence on a single funder.\nA year and a half after implementing the plan, we have made significant progress toward our goal.</p>\n<p>This session will reflect on our approach and key learnings. We will explain how we designed this plan, the challenges for sustainability that a FLOSS project faces, the learnings we have made during the process and the main actions we have taken</p>\n<p>We will delve into the different strategies we have designed to attract new funders, especially from the private and philanthropic sector, as well as the challenges we face when it comes to receiving funding from public agencies. Finally, we will evaluate the successes and failures of this plan.</p>\n<p>This is an ideal talk if you are interested in knowing the challenges that FLOSS projects face when seeking funding, want to learn which are the best strategies to diversify your sources of income and ensure a sustainable growth of your project.</p>",

Over the 20 years of XWiki and CryptPad, we have been able to measure what we miss for Open Source to be able to provide end user applications respecting user's Freedom and Privacy.</p>\n<p>We have also been able to see how the changes of price of competitors have brought us more customers allowing us to increase the funding of our own software.</p>\n<p>The challenge is a financial challenge, a business model challenge. In this talk we will show how we manage to hack our funding throughout the years and find ways to progressively improve our software, gaining status year by year and then allowing to increase customer revenue.</p>\n<p>We will also present our belief that in order for Open Source to strive, the community needs to solve the financial challenge and also chip in.

    "abstract": "<p>In this talk, I present some economical arguments for why companies should pay the Open Source maintainers they depend on, and I suggest some technological solutions for how this might be accomplished.</p>\n<p>Virtually all companies use Open Source software, making a critical subset of the Open Source ecosystem crucial for everything from watching YouTube videos to working with medical records. But the companies that use Open Source software rarely pay the maintainers of the software they depend on. I explain that this can lead to serious issues in the Open Source ecosystem, such as the international security risks we saw with the XZ backdoor and the Log4Shell vulnerability.</p>\n<p>I explain that, if companies paid the Open Source maintainers they depend on, the Open Source ecosystem would become more sustainable and stable while retaining the significant economical advantages provided by Open Source governance models, and companies would benefit from this.</p>\n<p>Next, I want to talk about how to actually pay maintainers. Forward-thinking companies have, in fact, shown their willingness to fund the Open Source software they depend on. But it is not always trivial to figure out which Open Source maintainers a large codebase depends on, and how to actually pay those maintainers.</p>\n<p>At thanks.dev, we have created a platform that scans companies' codebases to identify the Open Source maintainers whose projects these codebases depend on. We then give companies an easy and financially transparent way to pay these maintainers.</p>\n<p>But dependencies often form a complex tree, and it is not immediately clear how much money should go to each dependency's maintainer. Current methods, though helpful, are simplistic. I introduce a new algorithmic technique for fund allocation, which uses a combination of coupling and complexity metrics to calculate which dependencies are most critical to a certain project. Using this method can provide a better allocation of funds.</p>\n<p>I am keen to hear the community's feedback on both my economical and my technological suggestions, and to further develop solutions together.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Open scholarly infrastructures — open-source systems and solutions supporting the discovery and sharing of research — are pivotal in ensuring access to knowledge and fostering innovation. In 2024, Invest in Open Infrastructure (IOI) <a href=\"https://investinopen.org/state-of-open-infrastructure-2024/sooi-grant-funding-2024/\">mapped and analysed over $415M in grant funding</a> for open infrastructure to uncover key trends and opportunities with the aim of driving more informed, strategic, and coordinated investment towards a healthy and resilient ecosystem of open infrastructure. The analysis shows a significant number of grant awards reference the use of open infrastructure but do not directly support their development. Further, while a substantial portion of grant funding supports research and development work of open infrastructures, a significant need for sustained operational support remains largely unaddressed. This presentation will highlight these funding trends and discuss their implications for the sustainability of open infrastructure. We will also discuss potential strategies to catalyze investments from a more diverse pool of stakeholders to foster a more robust funding ecosystem for open infrastructure.</p>",

We’ll then take a close look at the fundraising truism that it’s all about making “the right ask to the right person at the right time” and how to apply this in your fundraising. Storytelling is the key to setting up the “right ask.” Networking is the key to getting to the “right person.” And events (from networking at conferences to hosting a reception) are one strategy for creating “the right time.”</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>With so many FOSS projects vying for funding opportunities and concerns about how to secure funding and bring stability to the FOSS ecosystem, it's hard to imagine deciding to decline funding that is immediately available. In this talk, we'll explore why accepting funding must be done thoughtfully. Not only should funding models support the fundamental goals of the project, but developers should also recognize that there are times when funding opportunities are not in their long term interests. We'll explore specific examples of circumstances where accepting funding from particular sources would compromise the project's brand or values, and when the expectations of the funder don't exactly match the developer's plans, leading to strained relationships going forward.  These issues touch on a variety of topics including project governance, brand management, community management and ethics, in addition to fundraising strategies for long term donor relationships.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>How do we get the European Union to invest in FOSS maintenance and security? This talk will explore the idea that the public sector should expand investment into Free and Open Source Software, with focus on investing in and maintaining FOSS being used as part of critical digital infrastructures. Instead of just calling for more funding for open source, public digital infrastructure, digital commons, etc, the talk will concretely compare proposed funding approaches, discuss the practicalities of an institution like the EU investing in FOSS maintenance and security, and examine how the funding might be delivered in the next Multiannual Financial Framework.</p>\n<p>The second part of the talk will highlight the opportunity for a Sovereign Tech Agency at the EU level which plays a greater role in funding the maintenance and security of FOSS. The German government's support to build the Sovereign Tech Fund, now the Sovereign Tech Agency, has received a lot of attention in Europe and globally for its ability to support and invest in the FOSS ecosystem. This talk will present an initial legal analysis for what an EU-scale Sovereign Tech Fund could look like, in consideration of three different potential institutional set-ups: (2) one EU funding body to rule them all, (2) a federated set up with a coordinating body/system, and (3) a free for all for all Member States to set up their own funding bodies. It will then consider the next steps for developing a more comprehensive feasibility assessment of this topic and making the case for FOSS funding to policymakers in the European Commission.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>More money for Free and Open Source Software - a never ending issue. In a tech world built on start-ups, venture capital and data-gathering apps, the fight for sustainable funding for ethical technology projects is a fierce one. After some big victories for FOSS funding in the last years, this talk is about the importance of not forgetting the small, underdog civil society projects.</p>\n<p>How do we fund technology in a sustainable way? Fund infrastructure, fund maintenance, fund that project some random person in Nebraska has been thanklessly maintaining since 2003. While infrastructure is extremely important (no questions asked), in this talk we want to explore why a diverse funding landscape that also allows for supporting new people and groups with fresh ideas can only be incredibly valuable to the field of FOSS.</p>\n<p>How can we use existing funding structures, bend and twist them to meet the real needs of communities? How can we make them more useful to projects and people who are not typically the recipients of their money? We want to talk about how to build support infrastructure that allows us to fund in ways that bring more diversity, more novel ideas and more inclusivity to our communities - and we want to talk about how to do this in a sustainable way. </p>\n<p>The background to this talk is our experience in managing the German FOSS Prototype Fund, which has funded nearly 400 projects over the past eight years together with the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research. Following an extensive internal and external evaluation, and as the initial funding was coming to an end, we spent the last year designing and setting up a new, more sustainable funding structure for early-stage projects. </p>\n<p>This talk is a call to government institutions, funders and other organisations with the power to distribute money to join forces, break down the barriers of their traditional funding models and create a broad and vibrant network of small, diverse and lightweight funds that meet the needs of different groups and communities. It is an invitation to communities to come together and share their needs in order to help build structures that can actually support their work. There is hope in FOSS projects, old and new, big and small. Let's hack all kinds of systems to give them the support they need.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>This talk will introduce <a href=\"https://github.com/hypermodeinc/modus\">Modus</a>, an open source framework for building intelligent GraphQL APIs powered by WebAssembly. We will learn how Modus auto-generates GraphQL APIs inferred by user-defined types and uses WebAssembly to enable highly performant and scalable APIs that run in a sandboxed memory efficient environment. Modus also brings the power of open source AI models to the API developer with first class support for working with AI models. We will demo using Modus to build an agentic API capable of fetching data from multiple sources and analyzing the data in real-time using knowledge graph RAG to make decisions using LLM tool use.</p>",

While Rust offers powerful features and performance benefits and the great code quality of the Matrix Rust SDK, limitations like WebAssembly’s inability to directly access system-level APIs (such as retrieving timestamps) pose significant hurdles.</p>\n<p>We’ll dive into the current state of Rust’s compatibility with WebAssembly for Matrix applications, highlighting what does work—most notably the crypto crate—and detailing the remaining steps to bring the full Rust SDK, up to the UI crate, into the browser. Additionally, we’ll discuss the challenges of creating JavaScript bindings for Rust code, including the current limitations of tools like uni-ffi and the manual effort required for bridging these worlds.</p>\n<p>Join us for the latest updates, insights, and perhaps even a sneak peek of a Rust SDK-powered webapp prototype.

    "abstract": "<p><a href=\"https://github.com/project-robius/robrix\">Robrix</a> is a new up-and-coming Matrix client for power users, written from scratch in Rust to demonstrate and drive the featureset of <a href=\"https://robius.rs/\">Project Robius</a>, a multi-platform app dev framework. Thanks to the efforts of the Robius software stack, and in particular the <a href=\"https://makepad.nl/\">Makepad UI toolkit</a>. Robrix runs seamlessly across Android, iOS, macOS, Linux, and Windows (with web and OpenHarmony to come), all without a single line of platform-specific code.</p>\n<p>This talk will cover the general architecture and features of Robrix, our experience developing apps in Rust and the challenges encountered therein, and how Robrix's needs have driven the development of ecosystem components. We'll demonstrate the high performance and efficiency of Robrix and its underlying software stack, along with some of its more \"unique\" features, such as a dockable tabbed UI view of multiple rooms akin to your favorite IDE (which works identically on smartphones, tablets, and desktops). </p>\n<p>Finally, we'll lay out our future vision for Robrix as an open-source \"hub\" app, bringing together many aspects of the fediverse beyond Matrix chat: decentralized social networks, decentralized identity providers like <a href=\"https://openwallet.foundation/\">OpenWallet</a>, and the integration of secure AI features via local LLMs that maintain data privacy &amp; sovereignty.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Intel provided a reference protocol for embedding Intel SGX attestation in the X.509 certificate to establish a TLS-based trusted channel named RA-TLS. This protocol does not use the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) architecture of the X.509 certificate; instead, it relies solely on attestation quote verification to verify the binding between X.509 certificate to the Intel SGX root-of-trust. It may not always be desirable, as quote verification is relatively more expensive compared to certificate chain verification with PKI in place. Moreover, Intel reference implementation for DCAP requires additional infrastructure, including Provisioning Certificate Caching Services (PCCS), which the Intel DCAP reference implementation is tightly coupled with. </p>\n<p>In this talk, we present TC4SE, previously published in the Information Security Conference 2023, which proposed a mechanism to bind SGX root-of-trust primitives with PKI root-of-trust to establish trusted channel. We also present some alternative mechanisms to eliminate the dependency on the web-based PCCS server when developing an Intel SGX application that requires quote generation and verification.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Trusted Execution Environments in combination with open-source and reproducible code provide transparency by relying on reviewers to analyze the Trusted Computing Base (TCB). And the size of the TCB directly influences the speed at which new releases and bug fixes are deployed to production, since reviews take a lot of time. So low-TCB environments are a desired solution that many teams try to achieve.\nBut even the main security features needed to implement a trusted workload, such as end-to-end encryption, require significant increases in the TCB. For example, more general approaches like TLS with an extensive feature set including support for many signature schemes, certificate parsing and session resumption logic may be less ideal for low-TCB environments.\nTo address this issue we will present a remote attestation scheme that uses Noise Protocol Framework to create an end-to-end encrypted attested channel between an end-user device and a TEE. Noise Protocol Framework allows us to minimize the amount of crypto primitives needed and only leave the logic that is necessary to establish an encrypted session and to bind it to the attestation evidence.\nDuring this talk we will also present an open-source implementation of our approach written in Rust.</p>",

This mechanism generates attestation evidence accepted by VERAISON, an open-source verification platform.</p>\n<p>The attestation mechanism measures the hash values of Trusted Applications (TAs) and generates attestation evidence using an attestation key stored in OP-TEE. It is implemented as a PTA (Pseudo Trusted Application), which functions as part of OP-TEE. The PTA is portable across different OP-TEE versions and extends attestation availability.</p>\n<p>We report the provisioning process for both the attester and verifier in this model, emphasizing the need for secure setup. Additionally, we explain how to program TAs and Client Applications (CAs) running on Linux to leverage this remote attestation mechanism. These explanations aim to enable broader adoption of remote attestation by users.</p>\n<p>The current source code is open and runs on QEMU and Raspberry Pi 3:\nhttps://github.com/iisec-suzaki/optee-ra\nWe are working to integrate this source code into the OP-TEE mainline:\nhttps://github.com/OP-TEE/optee_os/pull/7006</p>\n<p>Current Security Concerns and Future Plans\nThe current implementation has some security concerns. To address these, we propose three future enhancements:\n1) Key Management: Store the attestation key in an HSM (Hardware Security Module) for improved security.\n2) Secure Boot Confirmation: Ensure OP-TEE is securely loaded into the TEE during the boot process.\n3) Certificate-Based Attestation Keys: Introduce certificates for attestation keys to improve scalability.</p>\n<p>These plans involve specific hardware requirements, and we aim to implement them using a board equipped with the NXP i.MX 8M Plus processor and the Secure Element SE050.</p>",

H-hat is a high-level abstraction quantum programming language designed to close the gap between software development and quantum resources, by using familiar programming concepts in a hybrid paradigm. Its quantum type system introduces quantum types that can hold both classical and quantum types, define the number of indexes (qubits) that a quantum variable is able to use, as well as define the rules in which a quantum type can be cast into a classical type. The casting process causes the quantum variable to execute its context at runtime, compile the quantum instructions to be executed and measured in a quantum simulator or hardware, and provide the appropriate conversion method from bits sampling to the desired classical type.</p>",

Apache Mahout’s Qumat project allows users to write their circuits once and then run the same code on multiple vendors. In this talk we’ll discuss how Apache Mahout’s Samsara project introduced the idea of avoiding vendor lock-in by allowing machine learning experts to author algorithms in a vendor-neutral language that would then run everywhere. This spirit is living on in the Qumat project which allows user to write quantum circuits and algorithms (in a vendor-neutral Python library), which are then transpiled to run on IBM’s qiskit, Google cirq, Amazon Braket, or to extend the library to run on other hardware.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>We introduce ocvqc-py (On Chip Verified Quantum Computation - Python), a Python library for constructing verifiable measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) patterns. Verifiable quantum computation ensures that the output of a quantum computation can be relied upon even if the quantum device may be faulty or untrusted. Supported by pytket, the library is compatible with the Quantinuum ion-trap backend, enabling the construction of verifiable MBQC patterns compatible with near-term noisy quantum hardware. Building on the principles of quantum verification, ocvqc-py implements a novel approach to on-chip verification, allowing users to generate verifiable MBQC patterns without the need for quantum communication between client and server, which is typical in traditional verifiable MBQC setups. ocvqc-py has been used to construct measurement patterns with up to 52 vertices, demonstrated on the Quantinuum H1-1 ion-trap quantum computer, which is the largest verified MBQC pattern implemented to date.</p>\n<p>The full paper can be found here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24133\nThe code: https://github.com/CQCL/ocvqc-py</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>While containers have been pivotal in cloud computing, offering isolated environments for applications, they bring notable drawbacks. These include substantial overhead, resulting in larger, less efficient deployments and startup times, and a dependency on the underlying OS for security, posing potential vulnerabilities. </p>\n<p>WebAssembly (Wasm) addresses these challenges, and this talk will introduce the open-source project Boxer (https://boxer.dev), which offers tooling for taking existing containerized workloads and definitions, and creating near-universally deployable Wasm distributions (“Boxes”) offering roughly the same environment, with all the benefits of the WebAssembly target. Wasm, a compact binary instruction format, enables lightweight, sandboxed execution,  significantly reducing overhead compared to traditional containers. This leads to enhanced performance and smaller, more efficient deployments, ideal for cloud computing. Additionally, Wasm's memory-safe, isolated execution environment provides superior security, independent of the OS. Thus, Wasm, with its blend of efficiency and security, emerges as not just an alternative, but a substantial improvement over container technology for cloud deployments.</p>\n<p>With the main tools built in Rust, importantly, Marcotte (https://github.com/dphilla/marcotte) -- the underlying tool for virtualizing layers of system functionality -- allows us to make safe, sandboxed, discrete, and composable system functionality, by leveraging Rust's memory safety model, and the inherent properties of WebAssembly. </p>\n<p>This talk will critically examine this new technology, its approach, benefits, and existing limitations compared with containers, and its path forward as a new standard in cloud infrastructure.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Today there are several mature, state-of-the-art, general-purpose WebAssembly runtimes, but they are generally released as architecture- and OS-specific native binaries. </p>\n<p>Native binaries are the most general way to distribute a Wasm implementation; however, any programming language with a significant runtime environment faces some degree of friction when interfacing with native code. For instance:</p>\n<p>native code might make assumptions about memory management, which could conflict with automatic garbage collection, \nand it tends to assume ownership over threaded code, which won’t play well with abstractions over the operating system threads, such as user-space task schedulers.</p>\n<p>With “language-native runtime”, we mean a Wasm implementation that has been developed using the language of the host platform.</p>\n<p>Arguably, wazero was among the first language-native runtime environments for Wasm. wazero provides a pure-Go Wasm interpreter and a pure-Go just-in-time compiler for arm64 and amd64. But, even though this might be surprising, there are many similarities between the Go runtime and the Java runtime. </p>\n<p>We will compare how the two relate to each other while presenting Chicory, a fairly new language-native runtime written in pure-Java, featuring a Wasm interpreter and an ahead-of-time bytecode translator.</p>\n<p>By comparing wazero and Chicory, we propose language-native runtimes as a great solution to further spread Wasm for cross-platform software delivery.</p>",

On one hand, WASM offers unprecedented portability across platforms with almost near-native execution. On the other hand, unikernels can achieve extremely fast boot times, truely strong isolation with low CPU overhead and memory footprint. The presentation covers the development of a tool that builds and packages WASM unikernels as OCI-compliant images. Additionally, the talk demonstrates the seamless integration of WASM unikernels with Kubernetes through <code>urunc</code>, a unikernel container runtime, which treats them as standard containers. This end-to-end solution facilitates the building, deployment, and execution of WASM applications in a purely cloud-native manner, achieving a level of security and efficiency that surpasses the traditional container model.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p><strong>Netzgrafik-Editor (NGE)</strong> is an open-source software that enables the creation, modification, analysis and optimization of integrated interval timetables at a macroscopic level of detail, developed by Swiss Federal Railways (<a href=\"https://www.sbb.ch\">SBB CFF FFS</a>). </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/SchweizerischeBundesbahnen/netzgrafik-editor-frontend\">Source Code: Netzgrafik-Editor (github)</a>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/SchweizerischeBundesbahnen/netzgrafik-editor-frontend/blob/main/documentation/USERMANUAL.md\">User Manual: Netzgrafik-Editor</a>\n<a href=\"https://schweizerischebundesbahnen.github.io/netzgrafik-editor-frontend/\">Demo: Netzgrafik-Editor</a>\n<a href=\"https://nge.flatland.cloud\">Free Public Accessible Online Demo - Application</a></p>\n<p>Netzgrafik-Editor tackles a significant business problem by providing a robust solution for long-term timetable planning. A live demonstration will showcase the functionality and the excellent interactive user interface of the Netzgrafik-Editor.</p>\n<h4>Why a Human-Centric Approach Matters</h4>\n<p>Netzgrafik-Editor - together with our users we developed a novel approach for interactive timetable planning - user research, user involvement and usability testing were done among others to increase the user experience of the tool.</p>\n<p>The result of this human-centered approach is that the Netzgrafik-Editor is not only technically sophisticated but also intuitive and user-friendly. Planners can now create, adjust, and optimize schedules with ease. The tool adapts to their workflows, not the other way around. Users feel heard and taken seriously, which significantly increases their satisfaction and engagement.</p>\n<p>This story impressively demonstrates why a human-centered approach is so important. It ensures that technology serves people, not the other way around. The users like to use the Netzgrafik-Editor. This fosters innovation by putting actual needs at the forefront and users like to contribute and help to improve the tool which they have developed together with IT specialists. </p>\n<h4>Open Source As an Enabler</h4>\n<p>The Netzgrafik-Editor exemplifies a successful open-source project within the public transportation sectors. By embracing open collaboration, we leverage diverse expertise to address internal needs more effectively. This approach fosters a dynamic environment where building, sharing, and profiting from collective efforts become feasible. Open-source strategies enable us to reconsider traditional architecture principles, transitioning from a buy-versus-build mindset to one where open-source solutions empower us to build, share, and profit together.</p>\n<h4>Open Source is Not Enough - Attention Is All You Need</h4>\n<p>Our journey in the open-source realm has taught us valuable lessons, particularly in enhancing the visibility of our projects. Merely opening the source code is insufficient; we must also bridge the gap between software developers and end-users. By making our application freely accessible online, we ensure that it reaches a broader audience, demonstrating that open-source success relies not just on code availability but also on user engagement and accessibility.</p>\n<h4>Netzgrafik-Editor's Software - Some Insights</h4>\n<p>We have implemented much of the logic in the frontend (TypeScript) rather than the backend because performance and interactivity are crucial. Low latency and maximum responsiveness are thus ensured in the frontend.</p>\n<h4>Open Issues</h4>\n<p>One of our current key challenges is preventing forks in our open-source projects. We aim to benefit from all contributions, ensuring that enhancements and innovations made today and in the future remain integrated within the main project.</p>\n<p>Additionally, we seek ways to derive and share novel interaction design patterns that can be freely used, promoting consistency across open-source tools in similar application domains. By doing so, we hope to create a more cohesive and user-friendly ecosystem.

    "abstract": "<p>When planning long train trips across Europe (e.g. Brussels -&gt; Sicily), standard routing criteria such as travel time and number of transfers become less relevant. I want a comfortable connection, with enough buffers, in particular when operators change. If I need to stop somewhere overnight on long trips, let’s make it a place I haven’t visited yet! But please, let’s arrive there early enough so that I have time for some touristing. Aha, there is a (non-optimal) route through Munich? That’s a chance to visit an old friend I haven’t seen in a while! Oh, I see, I have to change trains in Rome anyway? Lunch out in the sun on the piazza, that sounds fantastic. In short, for such trips, the journey can often feel as part of the destination.</p>\n<p>The criteria listed above are quite personal and often only emerge while planning the trip. Sure, existing routing tools allow me to change my search settings and re-run the search. But what I really want is to interact with the proposed travel plans, to change them how I see fit. Move connections here and there, use drag&amp;drop to try out what would happen if I did take time for that lunch in Rome, how much later would I arrive at my destination? To explore on a map what possible routes there even are, and perhaps add a little detour to a place I’ve been wanting to visit.</p>\n<p>In my project Trans-Europe-Planner (funded by prototypefund/German Ministry of Education and Research), I am building such a user interface, testing out different UX mechanisms for interactively exploring, moving connections around, trying things out, comparing options. How that all works and how users respond to it, that is what I want to discuss in my talk.</p>",

Our mission is to offer a provider-neutral, international, cross-border, and privacy friendly routing that focuses on the interest of the user. In the future, this work can serve as a building block for open Google Maps alternatives. In this talk we will show you how our crowdsourced data collection process works and how you can join us and contribute. We will present clients such as <a href=\"https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-maps\">GNOME Maps</a> and their integration with Transitous.

This session introduces the <em>MyVector Plugin</em>, a project that brings native vector storage and similarity search to MySQL. Unlike PostgreSQL, which offers interfaces for adding new data types and index methods, MySQL lacks such extensibility. However, by utilizing MySQL's server component plugin and UDF, the <em>MyVector Plugin</em> successfully adds a fully functional vector search feature within the existing MySQL + InnoDB infrastructure, eliminating the need for a separate vector database. The session explains the technical aspects of integrating vector support into MySQL, the challenges posed by its architecture, and real-world use cases that showcase the advantages of combining vector search with MySQL's robust features. Attendees will leave with practical insights on how to add vector search capabilities to their MySQL systems.</p>",

Today, its maintainers not only draw directly from Gentoo, but also contribute directly back to Gentoo as well. Come and learn about how this relationship has evolved, how we've already benefited from each other's work, and what we plan to work on next. This ever-growing synergy has even led to us sharing a stand together at FOSDEM this year.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Managing Rust dependencies in linux distributions packaging often involves navigating a tangled web of missing packages, mismatched versions, and the need to patch vendored crates manually. In this talk, we’ll explore a solution to simplify this process in RPM based distros by enhancing the <code>rust2rpm</code> tool to automate the patching and repackaging of vendored dependencies.</p>\n<p>Even though the main approach is to have every dependency packaged, it often becomes really difficult to achieve that goal as you may find yourself out in a dependency hell situation where you'll have to deal with an outstanding number of them. Even if its a compromise you can bundle dependencies, but that comes with some drawbacks.</p>\n<p>When packaging, you may often find yourself in a situation where you'll  have to patch rpm's on the fly to fix out issues, but that's not really doable when you're working with bundled dependencies.</p>\n<p>We'll discuss about introducing a new <code>-p</code> flag in <code>rust2rpm</code>, which enables users to easily apply patches to vendored crates (like <code>fiat-crypto</code>), modify dependencies, and repackage them without the need for manual steps.</p>\n<p>We’ll also discuss a more flexible approach using a new helper tool, <code>rust2rpm-vendor</code>, that allows maintainers to prepare and patch vendor tarballs independently, automating the entire workflow from patch application to repacking.</p>\n<p>This talk will show how these enhancements can help alleviate \"dependency hell\" in Fedora’s Rust ecosystem, making it easier for maintainers to handle vendored crates and improve the overall Rust packaging experience.</p>\n<p>Links\n- <a href=\"https://pagure.io/fedora-rust/rust2rpm\">rust2rpm on Pagure</a></p>",

In many cases we still don't get issue reports upstream until weeks or months after a merge request landed.</p>\n<p>What's missing? Let's look at the remaining pain points around QA in the Linux OS world. Then we’ll look at research happening in the GNOME project to bring QA testing all the way to the merge request pipelines in GNOME Gitlab, so we can find integration issues as they happen.</p>\n<p>We’ll also touch on how systemd-sysext allows testing built artifacts in an OS in a distro-independent way. And we’ll look at how changes in openQA could mean that QA teams in different companies can join forces to build testsuites once, instead of everyone working separately to maintain their own.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>What if Ubuntu embraced a Rolling Release model? This might seem contradictory: Ubuntu typically follows a long-term support model with fixed, point-based releases, where packages remain stable at certain versions. In contrast, a rolling release model, commonly used by distributions based off of Arch Linux, requires ongoing, continuous package updates. While Ubuntu's standard model adheres to stability, it maintains a development branch called <code>devel</code>, akin to Debian's <code>sid</code> branch, on which it is based, and often even receiving updates sooner. While long-term support models prioritize security, rolling release models often cater more to user customization and development needs.</p>\n<p>The idea to create a rolling release variant for Ubuntu first manifested in the form of the <a href=\"https://github.com/wimpysworld/rolling-rhino\">Rolling Rhino</a> script in 2020, which allowed users to convert/upgrade their existing installs of Ubuntu to the <code>devel</code> branch, turning their familiar Ubuntu environments into Rolling Rhino ones. This concept was taken a step further in 2022, when a group of young developers turned it into a full-fledged fan flavour for Ubuntu, <a href=\"https://rollingrhino.org\">Rolling Rhino Remix</a>, which included the notable addition of two utilities: <code>rhino-config</code>, which allowed users to switch from Ubuntu’s LTS kernel to the mainline or real-time kernels, and <code>rhino-update</code>, which served as a wrapper script for updating all APT and Snap packages on the system.</p>\n<p>Rolling Rhino Remix evolved rapidly that year, undergoing numerous upgrades and integrations, with a particular focus on enhancing package management capabilities. The <code>rhino-update</code> utility added support for components such as <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/volian/nala\">Nala</a> (a <code>libapt-pkg</code> front-end alternative), Flatpak, and most importantly, the <a href=\"https://pacstall.dev\">Pacstall</a> package manager. As the project evolved, it outgrew the simple Ubuntu flavour concept, transforming into a dynamically designed developer distribution, which led to the creation of <a href=\"https://rhinolinux.org\">Rhino Linux</a>.</p>\n<p>One of the key distinctions between Rhino Linux and its predecessors is the full integration of the Pacstall package manager for handling much of the distribution’s core utilities and applications, such as the kernel, web browser, and IDE. Additionally, the distribution ships with the <code>rhino-pkg</code> utility, the successor to <code>rhino-update</code>, which serves as a wrapper script for Pacstall, APT, Flatpak, and Snap, while also extending beyond just updates, allowing users to search and install from all at once.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://pacstall.dev\">Pacstall</a> brings the package flexibility of Arch Linux’s AUR to Ubuntu and Debian, using <code>pacscripts</code> (similar to Arch's <code>PKGBUILDs</code>) to build <code>.deb</code> packages. With Pacstall, users can install from the community-maintained repository or source out-of-repository <code>.deb</code> packages, effectively making a stable Ubuntu base more adaptable to a rolling model. While Pacstall is available for almost all Ubuntu and Debian based distributions, Rhino Linux is built with Pacstall in mind from the ground up - and in consequence, the developer teams for Rhino Linux and Pacstall have largely crossed over.</p>\n<p>In this talk, two core team members will explore the history and technical foundation of both Rhino Linux and the Pacstall package manager, outline future directions, and, perhaps most importantly, share the challenges faced and insights gained from developing these projects as a small, student-led team.</p>",

The goal of introducing type annotations to the LuaRocks codebase was to help mitigate these maintenance problems, but implementing those was not as straightforward as I had imagined. In this talk, we'll discuss both the challenges and the outcomes of this transition, which led to improvements to both LuaRocks and Teal.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>rash is a minimal shell (so like bash, but much smaller) which supports asynchronous operations by saving its program state to a file, then terminating itself, and later being started again by the user, where it will read and continue from the saved program state.</p>\n<p>This approach achieves the same goal as running a background process and having it wait for input, but does so without burdening the operating system while not in use.  A program in rash can also be thought of as one big coroutine that gets suspended whenever needed and resumed when rerun.</p>\n<p>Arguably, the file-based state-keeping approach also makes the system more transparent and robust, since you will never end up with a hanging process that you forgot to feed.</p>\n<p>rash has been in active use since 2015 as a tool for writing stateful commands for a chatbot on Internet Relay Chat (IRC) channels, but may also be useful outside of IRC.</p>\n<p>While I'll argue in the presentation that rash as an overall idea is sound, I'll also touch upon the perhaps less-than-ideal syntax that was originally picked for the language, and how we are trying to improve this now that we would like to actually present it.</p>",

These compilers allow for immediate feedback and an interactive style of programming. A focus on programmer performance that does <em>not</em> lean on AI completion.

The use of effect handlers for runtime checks gives a powerful means to handle failures at runtime and to create code that is robust in case of programming errors that would otherwise result in a crash. I will dive into the Fuzion effect mechanism and explain how this it is used to implement design-by-contract as pure syntax sugar in a way that permits error handling at runtime. While doing this, some new fun aspects of Fuzion like free types or partial application will be presented. The talk will use live demos of the presented mechanisms.</p>\n<h1>Introduction</h1>\n<p>Fuzion is a new functional and object-oriented language built on the universal concept of a Fuzion feature, a generalization of a pure function and a class. Effect handlers are used to model non-functional aspects. The principle of Design-by-Contract with pre- and post-conditions is used to formally document the requirements and guarantees of features in a way accessible to static analysis and runtime checks.</p>\n<h1>Fuzion Language Overview</h1>\n<p>Fuzion is a modern general purpose programming language that unifies concepts found in structured, functional and object-oriented programming languages into the concept of a Fuzion feature.  It combines a powerful syntax and safety features based on the design-by-contract principle with a simple intermediate representation that enables powerful optimizing compilers and static analysis tools to verify correctness aspects.</p>\n<p>Fuzion was influenced by many other languages including Java, Python, Eiffel, Rust, Go, Lua, Kotlin, C#, F#, Nim, Julia, Clojure, C/C++, and many more.  The goal of Fuzion is to define a language that has the expressive power present in these languages and allow high-performance implementations and powerful analysis tools.  Furthermore, Fuzion addresses requirements for safety-critical applications by adding support for contracts that enable formal specification and enable detailed control over run-time checks.</p>\n<p>Many current programming languages are getting more and more overloaded with new concepts and syntax to solve particular development or performance issues. Languages like Java/C# provide classes, interfaces, methods, packages, anonymous inner classes, local variables, fields, closures, etc.  And these languages are currently further extended by the introductions of records/structs, value types, etc.  The possibility of nesting these different concepts results in complexity for the developer and the tools (compilers, VMs) that process and execute the code.</p>\n<p>For example, the possibility to access a local variable as part of the closure of a lambda expression may result in the compiler allocating heap space to hold the contents of that local variable.  Hence, the developer has lost control over the allocation decisions made by the compiler.</p>\n<p>In Fuzion, the concepts of classes, interfaces, methods, packages, fields and local variables are unified in the concept of a Fuzion feature. The decision where to allocate the memory associated with a feature (on the heap, the stack or in a register) is left to the compiler just as well as the decision if dynamic type information is needed.  The developer is left with the single concept of a feature, the language implementation takes care of all the rest.</p>\n<h1>Error Handling using Effects</h1>\n<p>Faults are a run time manifestation of program errors (bugs).  Typical language mechanisms used to cause for runtime faults are functions <code>assert</code> or <code>panic</code> or exceptions like <code>RuntimeException</code>. Here, I will show how this is done in Fuzion using design-by-contract and effects.</p>\n<h2>Introductory Example</h2>\n<p>Consider we are writing a feature that produces a string of the form <code>9² = 81</code> for any given numeric value, we can use this code</p>\n<pre><code>square(x N : numeric) =&gt; \"{x}² = {x*x}\"\n</code></pre>\n<p>[side note: <code>N</code> is a free type, so the feature <code>square</code> is defined for any type that matches the given constraint <code>numeric</code>. Free types are syntax sugar for explicit type parameters as in</p>\n<pre><code>square(N type : numeric, x N) =&gt; \"{x}² = {x*x}\"\n</code></pre>\n<p>Alternatively, an implementation for a specific type, e.g., <code>u32</code>, would look like this</p>\n<pre><code>square(x u32) =&gt; \"{x}² = {x*x}\"\n</code></pre>\n<p>side note end]</p>\n<p>However, this will crash somewhere in the calculation of <code>x*x</code> in case of an overflow, we would like to handle this case and create an error, one solution is to add error handling using <code>panic</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>square(x N : numeric) ! panic =&gt;\n  if x *! x                         # *! checks if * operation would succeed without an overflow\n    \"{x}² = {x*x}\"\n  else\n    panic \"overflow for $x\"\n\nsquare (u8 30)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here, <code>x *! x</code> checks if the multiplication can be performed without causing an overflow, such that we can avoid the error and call <code>panic</code> explicitly.</p>\n<p>This is, however, a little ugly since it is not clear whose fault it is if this panic would occur, is the implementation of <code>square</code> faulty or is the caller to blame?</p>\n<p>Using a pre-conditions documents the requirement on the argument <code>x</code> clearly in the signature of the feature and puts the blame on the caller:</p>\n<pre><code>square(x N : numeric)\npre\n  debug: x *! x\n=&gt;\n  \"{x}² = {x*x}\"\n</code></pre>\n<h2><code>fallible</code> effect</h2>\n<p>Fuzion provides an abstract effect <code>fallible</code> with inner feature <code>try</code> that  takes a nullary lambda argument and produces a result on with inner feature <code>catch</code> that takes a lambda to be executed in case for a fault. It can be used as follows</p>\n<pre><code>FALLIBLE\n  .try ()-&gt;\n    ... code that may call FALLIBLE.cause to produce an error ...\n  .catch e-&gt;\n    ... code that handles fault with error `e` ...\n</code></pre>\n<p>The idea is that any effect that may fail due to some error would inherit from <code>fallible</code> such that there is a common way to handle this effect.</p>\n<p>One example is the <code>panic</code> effect, we can now handle a panic as follows</p>\n<pre><code>panic.try ()-&gt;\n    say (square 1000000)\n  .catch s\n    say \"square panicked: $s\"\n</code></pre>\n<p>If not run within an explicit <code>panic.try</code>, the default panic handler will be invoked which propagate the panic to <code>fuzion.runtime.fault</code>.</p>\n<h2>fallible hierarchy</h2>\n<p>Similar to Java using the class inheritance mechanism to create a hierarchy of <code>Throwable</code> exceptions, we would like to have a hierarchy of <code>fallible</code> effects. In Fuzion, this is done via default handlers that propagate to a more generic fallible, where <code>fuzion.runtime.fault</code> is the most generic one.</p>\n<h2>pre and post-conditions as effects</h2>\n<p>Fuzion defines a hierarchy of <code>fallible</code>effects as follows</p>\n<pre><code>                   fuzion.runtime.fault\n                              A\n                              |\n                   +----------+--------------+\n                   |                         |\n       fuzion.runtime.contract_fault       panic\n                   |\n          +--------+-----------------+\n          |                          |\nfuzion.runtime.pre_fault    fuzion.runtime.post_fault\n</code></pre>\n<p>Pre- and post-conditions in Fuzion source code are essentially syntax sugar for code using the corresponding <code>pre_fault</code> and <code>post_fault</code> effects. The example above is de-sugared to code like this:</p>\n<pre><code>pre_square(x N : numeric) =&gt;\n  if !(debug: x *! x)\n    fuzion.runtime.pre_fault.env.cause \"debug: x *! x\"\n\npre_and_square(x N : numeric) =&gt;\n  pre_square x\n  square x\n\nsquare(x N : numeric) =&gt;\n  \"{x}² = {x*x}\"\n\npre_and_square (u8 30)\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Programmatic handling of faults</h2>\n<p>Now, it is possible to install handlers for a particular <code>fallible</code> at given points in the hierarchy, e.g., for <code>pre_fault</code> for preconditions only, <code>contract_fault</code> to handle <code>pre_fault</code> and <code>post_fault</code>, or the topmost <code>fault</code> to handle <code>pre_fault</code>, <code>post_fault</code>, <code>panic</code> and all other <code>fallible</code> that map to <code>fault</code>.</p>\n<h1>Type constraints</h1>\n<p>Using our square example with pre-condition, we see that the code does not work as expected for a float overflow:</p>\n<pre><code>say (square 3.2E200)\n</code></pre>\n<p>produces</p>\n<pre><code>3.2E200² = Infinity\n</code></pre>\n<p>instead of reporting an overflow. Using type constraints, we can specialize the code for specific type parameter values. In this example, we can extend our code to handle <code>float</code> differently in the pre-condition and disallow <code>N.infinity</code> as the result of squaring:</p>\n<pre><code>square(x N : numeric) ! panic\n  pre\n    debug: x *! x\n    debug: (if N : float then x*x != N.infinity else true)\n=&gt;\n  \"{x}² = {x*x}\"\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here, the <code>N : float</code> in the second precondition provides specific code for float types. The code in the following <code>then</code> clause sees <code>N</code> and all values of type <code>N</code> with the type constraint <code>float</code>, so it is possible to, e.g., access <code>N.infinity</code>, which is a type feature defined for <code>float</code> only.</p>\n<p>Type constraints like <code>N : float</code> are compile time constants since a copy of <code>square</code> will be created for each actual type <code>N</code>, so these can be optimized away for all other types.</p>\n<p>Such type constraints are extremely useful. E.g., Fuzion's base library feature <code>Sequence</code> contains a <code>sort</code> feature as follows</p>\n<pre><code>public sort\npre\n  T : property.orderable\n=&gt;\n  sort_by (&lt;=)\n</code></pre>\n<p>the precondition ensures that <code>sort</code> will only be called if the element type <code>T</code> of the <code>Sequence</code> defines an order, which permits using `&lt;='.</p>\n<p>[side note: partial application comes to our help here. Without, the code would look like this</p>\n<pre><code>  sort_by (a,b -&gt; a &lt;= b)\n</code></pre>\n<p>]</p>\n<h1>Conclusion and Next Steps</h1>\n<p>The implementation of Design-by-Contract using effect handlers is another step to simplify the language implementation by degrading this mechanism to syntax sugar for code using effects. At the same time, this makes the language more powerful by enabling code to handle failures at runtime.</p>\n<p>A small team of developers is working on bringing Fuzion ahead.

This time, let's catch up with recent developments that shipped in Teal 2024, consider the nature of user feedback received so far, and talk about in which direction should Teal 2025 and beyond go.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Awk was first included in Version 7 Unix in 1977 and then got a major upgrade in 1985 for Unix System V Release 3.1. After this GNU awk (gawk) was first released in 1988 and other versions of awk have also been written. It is part of the Single Unix Specification and part of the Linux Standard Base specification, so it is pretty much everywhere.\nAwk uses a pattern-action structure to manipulate numbers and strings and has a lot more power than many people really use it for. With a simple, C inspired syntax it is easy to prototype larger projects or to create self-contained scripts.\nStarting around gawk version 4.1.0 in 2013 the AWKPATH and AWKLIBPATH environment variables were introduced to allow adding external scripts and compiled libraries to be used to extend gawk without needing to vendor functions. Come see how easy it really is to extend gawk and create your own scripts and plugins.</p>",

In addition, CWL being a specification, it is easy to implement runners that are standards compliant but run on different execution environments—single machine, HPC cluster and cloud alike.</p>\n<p>In this talk, I will demo ravanan—a new CWL implementation that is powered by GNU Guix to provide strong reproducibility guarantees and bullet-proof caching. Thanks to GNU Guix's robust hashing of the entire dependency tree, ravanan's cache is guaranteed to never go stale: thus you never have to recompute any step and never fear that your cache may be stale. ravanan also provides high cluster utilization thanks to its use of propagator networks for scheduling. Intermediate computational steps are run as early as possible without blocking, even when only partial results are available from previous steps.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>VACASK is a novel FOSS analog circuit simulator with a clear separation between device models (i.e. equations) and circuit analyses. It is based on the state of the art KLU sparse matrix library and utilizes the OpenVAF Verilog-A compiler for building its device models from Verilog-A sources. A comparison with other FOSS analog circuit simulators is presented and the roadmap for future development is discussed. A major obstacle in development of VACASK (and every other new simulator) is the implementation of legacy device models that boils down to writing tens of thousands of lines of C code. Legacy device models are used in several older PDKs as well as in models of a large number of discrete electronic components. A novel approach to implementing these device models is proposed: a converter from SPICE3 API-based C code into modern Verilog-A code. The performance of the converted models is compared to that of native SPICE3 models. At the present the converted models can be used in VACASK and Ngspice circuit simulators as well as in any other simulator that supports Verilog-A. The limitations of the approach are discussed. Some alternative use cases for the converter are proposed and a roadmap for its future development is presented.</p>",

Currently 68 device models are available, ranging from simple elements like analog gain cells or digital inverters up to complex ones like a digital state machine , SRAMs, 3D table models or interfaces to digital Verilog building blocks compiled with Verilator. The simulation with digital blocks is fast, since event based. The interface between digital and analog blocks is automated.</p>\n<p>The use of the XSPICE code models has been hampered a bit due to their specific interfaces and the lack of graphical symbols of its elements for creating user readable circuit diagrams.</p>\n<p>So I have started a project to provide XSPICE code model support via the well-known KiCad/ngspice integration. It comprises of a symbol library and its assiciated device models assembled in a subcircuit model library. In the talk I will inform about its concept and status and will present some application examples.</p>\n<p>https://forum.kicad.info/t/simulation-with-xspice-code-models/56384\nhttps://sourceforge.net/projects/ngspice/</p>",

Today, proprietary\nsimulators supposedly implement the most efficient algorithms yet inspired by\npublic research from the past century. Meanwhile, the Gnucap project is making\nprogress harvesting the breaktroughs, for use in free/libre software.</p>\n<p>To address the interoparability across circuit design tools, and across\nmodelling domains, Verilog-AMS was created. Verilog-AMS extends traditional\nVerilog by analog features known from SPICE, and permits models that interact\nwith both the digital and analog domains. The standard expertly allows for\nvendor-independent representations of modern circuit designs.</p>\n<p>1 In this talk, we will explain the new revision of our proposed IEEE 1364-2005\n  compliant schematic interchange format, and how seamless interaction will\n  empower FOSS EDA tools. We will outline work in progress, possibly demonstrate\n  an application, and hint at opportunities. We will explain how the interchange\n  will extend towards PCB design and layout</p>\n<p>2 We will summarise new mixed signal features available in modelgen-verilog.\n  This includes monitored analog events, as well as discrete modelling in terms\n  of user defined primitives. We will expand on the usefulness of discrete\n  disciplines and \"connect modules\", and give an update on the implementation\n  status.</p>\n<p>3 On the algorithmic end, we have added a plugin interface for VLSI-ready\n  matrix solvers to the zoo. We will highlight a new solver combining temporal\n  sparsity with the time/space efficiency of \"conventional sparse\" LU\n  decomposition. We will explain why Gnucap will outpace traditional (open\n  source) solvers on virtually all instances, both small and big circuits.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>In the field of semiconductor technology, compact modeling, and IC designs, the OpenPDK Initiative provides an international platform for discussing advanced technologies, fostering collaboration among industry and academic leaders in electronic design automation (EDA). We review selected R\\&amp;D topics presented at a recent event by prominent academic researchers and industrial professionals who presented and discussed innovative approaches in CAD/EDA tools, techniques including compact/SPICE modeling, and IC design that address the demands of emerging semiconductor technology applications. However, the semiconductor industry also faces many challenges in maintaining the growth of its workforce with skilled technicians and engineers. To address the increasing need for well-trained workers worldwide, we must find innovative ways to attract skilled talent and strengthen the local semiconductor workforce ecosystem. The FOSS CAD/EDA tools with the recently available open access PDKs provide a new platform to connect IC design beginners, enthusiasts and experienced mentors to benefit from the collaboration opportunities enabled by the fast-growing open-source IC design movement. The collaborative development of open-source integrated circuit (IC) designs is becoming increasingly feasible due to the rapid expansion of OpenPDKs recently offered by SkyWater, GF and IHP with an open schedule of MPW Runs for FMD-QNC project in 2024-25. This paper demonstrates the FOSS CAD/EDA contribution to the SPICE/Verilog-A modeling/standardization, compete IC design flow (Xschem, Qucs-S, ngspice, Xyce, OpenVAF, OpenEMS, Magic, kLayout, OpenRoad), in addition selected, open-source examples of analog/RF and digital IC designs will be presented.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>The OpenFlexure Microscope is an open source laboratory-grade digital robotic microscope. As a robotic microscope, it is able to automatically scan microscope slides creating, enormous multi-gigapixel digital representations of samples. The microscope is already undergoing evaluation for malaria and cancer diagnosis in Tanzania, Rwanda, and the Philippines. As an open project our key goal is to support local manufacturing of microscopes in low resource settings. But, how can an open source project empower local manufacturers to make hardware certified for diagnostic use?</p>\n<p>Collaborative hardware design is notoriously difficult without complex Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) systems. However, Git provides more powerful version control than the most expensive proprietary PLM systems, especially if you use a code-based CAD package. Platforms like GitLab give clear records of project management through issue and merge request threads. Also, CI pipelines give us the ability to perform regular code quality checks, automate the generation of print-ready 3D models, and to generate detailed always-up-to-date assembly documentation and diagrams.</p>\n<p>This high-quality consistent documentation has enabled thousands of microscopes to be built around the world, in over 50 countries. Microscopes have been used on all seven continents, from the Antarctic sea ice to the rainforest in Panama. They have been used for educational workshops in Sweden and Ghana, and even built by mobile makerspaces in wartime Ukraine. Hospitals already use the microscope to for remote consultancy and training, however without certification it cannot be used for diagnosis.</p>\n<p>Combining good documentation with accessible calibration routines, gives manufacturers and users confidence that their locally-manufactured device performs as well as the thousands of other OpenFlexure Microscopes around the world. Building in robust calibration is crucial in our push towards medical certification.</p>\n<p>This talk will involve live microscopy demonstrations, give an overview of the microscope and its applications, as well as diving into deeper questions of open source workflows for managing diagnostic device design.</p>",

In addition, SPDX has taken the decision to create a cryptographic algorithms list following the work done on the SPDX License List.   </p>\n<p>The talk will provide an overview of why including crypto algorithms in SBOMs is relevant in a variety of use cases for different industries. It will describe the work done by SCANOSS during 2024 in this field, including how the open data set published with crypto algorithms information is evolving, now the SPDX Crypto Algorithms List is defined as upstream, as well as recent improvements in the detection mechanisms. Measures to promote contributions to it will be announced during the talk.  </p>\n<p>The speaker will then ask the audience about how to improve the data set, so it becomes useful to an increasing number of use cases, so more organizations and upstream projects include cryptographic algorithms in SBOMs. The talk will end by providing the opportunity to the audience to point to other developments that should be considered in this field, and how and where we can create the corresponding forum to coordinate further actions during 2025.</p>\n<p>Crypto_algorithms_open_dataset: https://github.com/scanoss/crypto_algorithms_open_dataset</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>As everyone involved with SBOMs knows, the accurate and efficient recording of data about software components is crucial for security, compliance, and operational efficiency. This presentation introduces a novel data modeling approach that leverages an ontology in RDF terms, similar to the approach used by SPDX. This new model distinguishes between abstract software components and specific software packages, providing a more granular and efficient way to manage software metadata.\nTraditionally, SBOMs have focused on recording information about software packages, such as \"OpenSSL v3.0.1 distributed by Ubuntu\" or \"OpenSSL v3.1.1 distributed by Debian.\" However, this approach can lead to redundancy and inefficiencies, particularly when dealing with licensing information and other metadata that is common across multiple versions and distributions of the same software. Our novel ontology introduces the concept of a \"component\" as an abstract reference to a piece of software, distinct from a \"package,\" which represents a specific version of the software distributed by a particular supplier.\nBy implementing this distinction, our ontology allows for the creation of relationships between different parts of the software ecosystem. For example, both \"OpenSSL v3.0.1 distributed by Ubuntu\" and \"OpenSSL v3.1.1 distributed by Debian\" can be linked to the abstract component \"OpenSSL.\" This relationship-based approach not only enhances the clarity and organization of SBOM data but also leads to significant storage savings. Common information, such as the licensing terms of a component, can be stored once and referenced across multiple packages, eliminating redundancy.\nThe practical application of this ontology can be demonstrated by a new tool called TOSCA (The Open Source Component Aggregator) that we have developed. TOSCA demonstrates the power and efficiency of this data model by aggregating and managing millions of data points about open-source components. While the presentation will primarily focus on the ontology and its benefits, TOSCA will be mentioned as a proof of concept that highlights the real-world applicability and advantages of this approach.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Batteries are a bottleneck in the energy transition. They can be expensive, require strict operating conditions, and may pose safety risks. Batteries degrade with time and use. Some chemistries rely on problematic minerals in their supply chains and others are hard to recycle at the end of their useful lives.</p>\n<p>Yet, batteries can unlock clean mobility, stabilize electrical networks powered by intermittent renewables, provide backup emergency power, enable off-grid systems, and many other benefits. Many closed-source enterprises are competing to provide solutions in this space, but the commercial path to scale is difficult, with many startups running out of funding before their product hits the market. When they’re in business, there is little transparency or external validation of their development process, and if they go out of business, the wider community learns little from their failures.</p>\n<p>We will present our efforts as part of the Flow Battery Research Collective (FBRC) to develop an open-source battery technology for stationary applications. FBRC is developing a battery designed for stationary energy storage use at the residential scale, that aims to be cheaper, safer, longer lasting, more sustainable, and more recyclable than current technologies. We’ll give a quick overview of existing battery technologies and cover the fundamentals of the technology we are working with—flow batteries—and why we picked this technology. </p>\n<p>We’ll cover our progress so far, our roadmap, and how we plan to integrate with the many open-source power electronics and battery/energy management systems that exist on the other side of our development gap. Network-connected batteries need secure software/firmware to operate safely; we will go over some ways in which a (flow) battery could be abused if a bad actor were able to control the system remotely. Finally, we will present our personal observations on launching an open-source, mechanical/chemical hardware project and how it aligns with/diverges from conventional open-source software communities.</p>",

In the Eco:Digit project, we embarked on a journey to measure and understand energy consumption in virtualized cloud environments, uncovering the challenges of correlating software workloads with physical resource usage.</p>\n<p>This talk shares the process of developing energy profiles for cloud infrastructure, focusing on the use of open-source conform SCS clouds to create an energy model. We will discuss the technical and methodological hurdles we faced—such as accessing host-level metrics in virtualized environments, calibrating virtual consumption against physical measurements facing heterogeneous hardware, and dealing with limited transparency in hyperscaler clouds.</p>\n<p>Key lessons shared include how to design a test environment that reliably maps energy consumption across physical and virtual layers, the importance of integrating diverse monitoring tools, and the role of collaborative partnerships with cloud providers like PlusServer and ScaleUp. Finally, we'll present the current state of our energy profiling system, showcasing its capabilities for generating detailed energy consumption reports and enabling actionable sustainability insights.\nThis talk will provide the audience with technical takeaways and practical knowledge for anyone interested in energy monitoring, open-source cloud infrastructure, or advancing sustainability in the digital domain.</p>",

When looking at emissions over the lifespan of devices, the vast majority of CO2 (85+%) comes from production, not usage.</p>\n<p>Moving to a circular economy can reduce the disproportionate energy consumption and CO2 emissions associated with hardware manufacturing. Hardware and software are inextricably linked, and a Free Software license disrupts the produce-use-dispose linear model of hardware and enable the shift to a reduce-reuse-recycle circular model. In this talk I provide an overview of the environmental harm driven by both hardware and software and how FOSS is well-positioned to address the issues. I will link the inherent values that come with a Free &amp; Open Source Software license to sustainable software design. Finally, I will present the various ways that Free Software can prevent the unnecessary production of new devices, whether by adapting the software to hardware one already owns, or recycling existing software to support the newest hardware being produced.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Open communication protocols and open source software go hand in hand and fuel each other. But there is a potential chicken-and-egg problem: Should the OEMs support it first, or are they waiting for widespread support of the protocol in EMS implementations (who are hesitant if the OEMs don't support it)?</p>\n<p>The only forward is to start showing real solutions and implementations with front-runners from both sides. Then, these smaller showcases can become an avalanche and lift the sector up in an open way. Both steps are difficult and need partnerships.</p>\n<p>Energy flexibility optimization behind the meter is already deployed in practice. However, networking protocols and definitions of flexibility are used which are not standardized and not openly available. This makes building new solutions with new flexible energy assets (like EVs, batteries, heat pumps and also solar inverters) a chore and drives up costs. Each new energy asset (or new brand) has to be integrated with their specific protocols and patterns. New protocols attempt to standardize these concepts, such as the S2 protocol. It targets an international audience for both existing and new/future energy assets. See https://s2standard.org/ </p>\n<p>S2 is approved as European standard, but the next batteline is to showcase that implementations can work and that both sides, OEMs and EMS, are willing to get to work. Open source implementations will provide building blocks and serve as reference.</p>\n<p>This presentation will show the efforts and experiences of two different consortia, from different implementation projects, with adopting the protocol and creating tools to spur adoption by other innovators and OEMs. Of course, we will also briefly outline the protocol itself, and address differences and shared features in other existing protocols in this space, like EEBus and OpenADR.</p>\n<p>We hope this talk can spur more interest and collaboration in this space and towards a lift for open efforts in the industry. </p>\n<p>Join our presentation if you want to learn more about protocol standardization efforts within the energy transition and S2 specifically!</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Last year we presented our first residential pilot, together with DSO Alliander in Amsterdam where we prevent local net congestion by incentivising residents in the same district to shift power consumption outside forecasted time windows of net congestion. In this presentation we are sharing the results: residents actually participate and change their behaviour.</p>\n<p>In the initial step we took a gamification approach where everybody can participate, regardless of their personal situation. Now, with active involvement of Alliander we are extending the approach towards automation logic for charging, thermostats and home batteries. We will share the forecasting and optimisation methods we are using for combining automation with the original gamification.</p>\n<p>The next challenge is to enable users to participate in additional markets at the same time without creating conflicts: local congestion, dynamic tariffs, energy sharing and even seasonal storage. With that in mind we started additional projects with the City of The Hague and DSO Stedin, as well as with the City of Arnhem and DSO Alliander. We are combining household participation in reducing net congestion with optimising shared assets such as district batteries and public charging. Jointly we started a collaboration with GOPACS (the Dutch congestion management portal) to enable the energy community of residents to trade, a first of it's kind. We will demonstrate the cases for Amsterdam, Arnhem, and The Hague.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Heating and cooling account for around 50% of Europe’s final energy consumption, making renewable heating and cooling technologies a significant lever to reduce carbon emissions. One well established renewable heat technology is solar thermal. Solar thermal systems use solar radiation to heat a working fluid directly, providing a low-cost heat source with a significantly better specific yield per unit of collector area than PV. Solar thermal collectors have been used to supplement domestic hot water heating for decades, but more recently the market for large solar thermal arrays to supply bulk heat to district heating systems or industrial customers has begun to grow significantly. At present long-term monitoring of these systems is carried out using a variety of proprietary tools developed by industry stakeholders – with limited agreement on methodology and little transparency on the algorithms being employed – or not at all. To address this, the international standard ISO 24194 was published in 2022, providing an open standard for the assessment of the performance of solar thermal arrays in operation. The SunPeek project is the first open-source implementation of this standard and aims to become the reference implementation by providing an open, trusted, user friendly application with well documented design decisions in cases where the standard is ambiguous. SunPeek is designed with highly automated workflows in mind and includes robust data preprocessing and error checking. It also includes several extensions of the ISO methodology to allow valid assessments to be made under a wider range of operating conditions, and funding has been secured to add fault detection, localization and remediation decision support functionality.  </p>\n<p>Several use cases are cases envisioned including: </p>\n<p>Long term automated regular performance assessment. </p>\n<p>performance guarantee verification (a use case which clearly demonstrates the value of being open source, due to verifiability of the codebase) </p>\n<p>Research applications </p>\n<p>Integration into existing fully featured plant monitoring solutions.  </p>\n<p>Different interfaces and packaging formats are provided to support these.  </p>\n<p>The core functionality is written in python, and made available as a package on PyPi (https://pypi.org/project/sunpeek/). </p>\n<p>A set of docker images and a compose configuration allow deployment as a web application with Vue.js based user interface and FastAPI based REST API. </p>\n<p>The project is hosted on GitLab (https://gitlab.com/sunpeek), documentation is at https://docs.sunpeek.org and a demo is available at https://demo.sunpeek.org. </p>\n<p>This work has been supported by the Austrian Research Promotion Agency (project HarvestIT, project number FFG 887648, and IEA SHC Task 68, FO999890460) and the European Commission (project IndHeap, proposal number 101136140).</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Energy services are highly interconnected with socio-economic development and human well-being. Yet, life without reliable energy is a reality for more than 675 million people globally, while more than 2 billion people use polluting fuels to cook their meals. Addressing the critical challenge of extending energy access to the unserved and underserved communities, more than six decades after full electrification in Europe and the United States, is imperative. Unfortunately, the current trajectory falls short. The latest SDG 7 Tracking Report highlights that the world is off course in achieving Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7 by 2030, with 85% of those without electricity residing in Sub-Saharan Africa. The repercussions of this shortfall are significant, with adverse impacts on societies and economies: inadequate healthcare persists, educational institutions struggle to provide quality education, and agricultural and industrial sectors face competitiveness challenges in regions where reliable energy remains elusive. Despite efforts such as grid extension, community-run mini-grids, and individual household solutions, progress has been insufficient because these solutions haven't been delivered at scale, in a coordinated way. We urgently require access to data, analytical tools and innovative strategies to deliver affordable, reliable, and clean energy to those who lack access to it. While existing solutions have primarily focused on supply-side and technology-centric approaches, there's a crucial need to prioritize demand-side perspectives to truly meet the needs of users, whether households or institutions.</p>\n<p>What is the Energy Access Explorer (EAE)? \nTo help address this challenge, WRI, in collaboration with partners has developed the Energy Access Explorer (https://www.energyaccessexplorer.org/; https://github.com/energyaccessexplorer) (EAE), a data-driven, integrated and inclusive approach to achieving universal access to energy for equitable, socio-economic development. EAE is the first, open-source, online and interactive geospatial platform that enables energy planners, clean energy entrepreneurs, donors, and development institutions to identify high-priority areas for energy access interventions. EAE functions also as a dynamic information system, reducing software engineering and data transaction costs for both data providers and users and facilitating data management and governance.  </p>\n<p>Use cases \nWith over 25,000 users, 48% of which are women, EAE users can customize the analysis and identify areas of interest based on their perspective. More specifically, the use of this platform enables the following:</p>\n<p>Energy Planning Agencies improve the ways integrated and inclusive planning is carried out using a data-informed approach. They will explore the potential for grid extension, off grid systems, clean cooking technologies and renewables for expanding energy access where needed the most. Clean Energy Enterprises, especially the ones with limited or no market intelligence / GIS capacity in house, identify new market opportunities. They will access demographic, socio-economic data, consumer ability to pay for energy services combined with information on energy resource availability and power infrastructure to locate priority areas for expanding their businesses.  Service Delivery Institutions in the health, education, productive use of energy, agriculture sectors get a better understanding of energy needs associated to development services. Clean Cooking agencies identify areas where the uptake of clean cooking technologies should be prioritized based on location specific data on demand, supply and environment. Donors and Development Finance Institutions identify areas where their grants and investment will have the most impact.  </p>\n<p>Outcomes to Date\nTo date, EAE has contributed to: the Powering Healthcare Roadmap of the Government of Zambia and the Powering Healthcare initiative of the Health Ministry in Uganda, the development of local, integrated and inclusive County Energy Plans in Kenya, to support the 0.5 billion USD Africa Mini Grid and the Energizing Agriculture Program in Nigeria, to inform the results based financing scheme for off grid electrification in Ethiopia and to establish cross sectoral EAE working groups enabling an integrated and inclusive approach to planning.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Decentralized Electric Utilities (DEUs) and Solar-Home-System distributors (SHS-D) are increasingly emerging to reach and serve deep rural unelectrified communities in the global south (mainly in Africa and Asia). These DEUs &amp; SHS-D are required to handle a vast and complex range of technical (e.g., energy, power, etc. ) and financial data points from their operations daily. Particularly, domestic small and midsize entrepreneurs find themselves hands-tied in their quest to digitize and optimize their operations, allowing them to scale and reach more unserved rural communities. The integrations with different energy asset communications and the integrations with payment providers (e.g., mobile money, which is widely used) come with significant efforts for these small-size companies. Therefore, we see an enormous value (in supporting bottom-up, locally driven rural electrification) in the provision and maintenance of the Open Source MicroPowerManager, where all those integrations and interopearbilities need to be set up only on time and benefit a variety of domestic companies and initiatives. Also, the operational and business models of the different DEUs and SHS-D are generally slightly different. The core processes are the same, and the Open Source MicroPowerManage software provides all the required basic functionalities to ease these processes. </p>\n<p>In the presentation, we will dive into the current technology setup of the Project, both organizationally and technically. We want to shed light on the MicroPowerManager, its current functionalities, feature pipeline, particular technical and community-building challenges, and other possible use opportunities. We hope to have fruitful exchanges and interesting feedback from the community; maybe one or the other wants to support our journey.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Solar energy is predicted to be the largest form of power generation globally by 2040 and having accurate forecasts is critical to balancing the grid. Unlike fossil fuels, renewable energy resources are unpredictable in terms of power generation from one hour to the next. In order to balance the grid, operators need a close estimate of when and how much solar and wind power will be generated on a given day. </p>\n<p>Open Climate Fix (an open source AI company) developed and deployed PVNet, a large ML model which forecasts solar generation for the next 36 hours. The forecasts are used by the UK electricity grid operator for real-time decision making and for reserve planning. These forecasts can save 200,000 tonnes of CO₂ and £20 million per year. </p>\n<p>But how do we make sure the model is usable by the Open Source community? We will explore the challenges of accessing 100s of TB of Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) datasets, and the challenges of data engineering these large NWP datasets. We will also talk about the challenge of working with these large ML models and what we are doing to enable the Open Source community to benefit. </p>\n<p>Open Climate Fix is an open-source not for profit company using machine learning (ML) to respond to the need for accurate renewable energy forecasts. Connecting energy industry practitioners with ML researchers doing cutting-edge energy modelling is our aim, and one way we seek to do this is by making much of our code open-source.</p>",

It has been actively developed ever since. AMIRIS represents all major actors in the electricity system, models their assets and decision strategies, and enables its users to observe emerging market dynamics. To this end, AMIRIS includes agents for market places, trading, power plant operation, storage operation, demand-side flexibility, and policy instruments. <a href=\"https://zenodo.org/records/5726738\">Back-testing</a> demonstrates the high quality of AMIRIS results.</p>\n<p>We aim to provide a powerful open tool that is usable by scientist and market stakeholders alike. In order to leverage the power of the open source community, we constantly lower the barriers for new people onboarding the project by continuously improving our <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/dlr-ve/esy/amiris/amiris/-/wikis/home\">documentation</a>, creating easy installation and execution <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/amirispy\">routines</a>, and providing extensive open <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/dlr-ve/esy/amiris/examples\">data sets</a> and <a href=\"https://zenodo.org/communities/amiris\">training material</a>. To enable smooth integration of AMIRIS in other workflows, we follow the <a href=\"https://zenodo.org/records/6623556\">FAIR4RS principles</a> and provide a full metadata description of AMIRIS model parameters, linking to the <a href=\"https://openenergyplatform.org/ontology/\">Open Energy Ontology</a> wherever possible.</p>\n<p>This talk will give a brief introduction to the AMIRIS model and its toolchain, demonstrate its installation and execution, provide examples of AMIRIS applications, and show the roadmap for future developments.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Geomagnetic disturbances resulting from space weather activity have the potential to disrupt or damage the bulk electric power system, but the severity is a hotly debated topic. Compared to other large scale contingency events on electric power systems, the impact of Geomagnetic Disturbances is  a rare event. This means that little in the way of empirical data is available to quantify impacts or to guide policymakers or utilities in hardening systems against such events. We present PowerModelsGMD.jl, an open-source  Julia toolbox within the PowerModels.jl ecosystem for analysis and optimal mitigation of such events. This talk will discuss the state of open-source software in this problem space, the software architecture of PowerModelsGMD.jl, how it can be applied to produce actionable results, and summarize remaining research gaps.</p>",

It is an amalgamy of electronics hardware, real-time embedded software and control algorithms. It is complex, hard and central to decarbonizing society.  <br />\nYet, despite its key role in the transition, power electronics is still an obscure discipline only properly understood by a handful few. It has not yet gone through the type of open-source fast-prototyping revolution brought about by Arduino or Raspberry Pi in the industrial informatics and computer fields.\nWe at OwnTech are dedicated to do just that: revolutionize the way power electronics is taught, understood and used in the field.\nLast year we introduced ourselves to the FOSDEM community, this year we bring the updates and showcase our consolidated open-software and open-hardware advancements.<br />\nIn this talk we will briefly describe the origin of our project, our technology and provide a working demo of our V1 embedded software. We will also show you our hardware, the types of functions it can provide and how it can become a game-changer in the power electronics fast prototyping community.<br />\nSee you at the FOSDEM Energy DevRoom!</p>",

    "abstract": "<p><a href=\"https://citycatalyst.openearth.org/\">CityCatalyst</a> is an Open Source Web application for managing a city's climate journey. Cities can start tracking greenhouse gas emissions using CityCatalyst from a variety of sectors -- buildings, transportation, waste, agriculture, industry -- in the <a href=\"https://ghgprotocol.org/ghg-protocol-cities\">GHG Protocol for Cities (GPC) format</a>. They can assemble emissions data from different public data sources, including nationally-tracked environmental data, AI models, or satellite data. They can also update their emissions data manually, using well-established methodologies. The reports generated by these emissions inventories can be shown on a public dashboard for citizens or disclosed to investors or international tracking organizations. Upcoming versions of the platform will also include risk assessments (what effect will climate change have on the city?) and action planning (what can the city do to lower risk and emissions). As an Open Source tool, CityCatalyst lowers the costs of climate change tracking and puts power into the hands of cities of all sizes and in all parts of the globe.</p>\n<p>CityCatalyst is built using the open source projects React, NextJS, ChakraUI, Tailwind, PostgreSQL, Sequelize, Nivo, Pigeon Maps and many more.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/Open-Earth-Foundation/CityCatalyst\">Project repository on Github</a></p>",

    "abstract": "<p>We are Benjamin and Marc from Germany, and our mission is to help solve the climate crisis by developing affordable, highly profitable, and resource-efficient (100 times less material compared to a wind turbine) airborne wind energy systems that can be deployed everywhere, quickly. We believe that an open source strategy can achieve this. Our first system, scaled for maximum affordability, will make powerful renewable energy available to everyone, even in winter and at night. Our prototype is already capable of everything that is needed for fully autonomous operation. See it in operation at <a href=\"https://kitesforfuture.de/\">kitesforfuture.de</a> and on our Youtube channel!</p>\n<p>Now, we need to make it fit for everyday use. For that, we would like to call on like-minded enthusiasts and supporters to join our endeavour. Until now, we have developed everything ourselves - from the aircraft and the ground station to the PCBs, and most importantly, the autopilot and control software, including web control and OTA-Update functionalities. In doing so, we have found clever solutions to produce the most simple yet safe system so far, building on Open-Source platforms such as the VESC motor controller wherever possible. Ever since our first steps in 2020, our progress could be followed on Github and Hackaday.</p>\n<p>Our vision is to develop a powerful global community that together overcomes the problems that so far have plagued closed-source projects in airborne wind energy.</p>\n<p>There is a lot of exciting stuff left to do: From testing and improving the control software to developing the first anti-collision system for Airborne Wind Energy based on transponder data and optical image detection...</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://kitesforfuture.de/\">https://kitesforfuture.de/</a></p>",

    "abstract": "<p>In this talk, the XZ Upstream Supply Chain Attack (CVE-2024-3094) is used as a case study to demonstrate how supply chain attacks can be detected by tracing the build system by a graph based approach. The increasing prevalence of supply chain attacks on Free/Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS) projects has been highlighted recently by the supply chain attack on the xz project to backdoor SSH servers. The detection of this particular attack was coincidental, raising concerns about potentially undetected threats.</p>\n<p>C/C++ build systems, such as GNU autotools, Make, and CMake, have grown highly complex and diverse, exposing a large attack surface to exploit. However, essentially, these build systems all compile the source code to object files and link them together to executables or libraries. For FLOSS projects, we can be even more stringent by postulating that every binary must originate from source code within the upstream project. Technically, this relationship can be modeled by the help of a graph data structure. By traversing this graph, it can be ensured that all distributed binaries originate from upstream source code showcasing the successful detection of the supply chain attack.</p>\n<p>Further studies could scale this approach to analyze all Debian packages regularly to detect anomalies early. To prevent attacks (or at least make them harder to conceal), the authors further propose transitioning to a descriptive build system, which reduces complexity and increases transparency, making separate tracing unnecessary.</p>\n<p>The source code of the proof-of-concept can be found one Github:\nhttps://github.com/Fraunhofer-AISEC/supply-graph</p>",

In response, the Open Sustainable Technology community has developed a range of strategies to make FOSS an essential factor in the fight against climate change and biodiversity loss. The number of possibilities we encountered was both inspiring and surprising, though many are only partially realizable within our current capacity as a community.</p>\n<p>This talk marks the beginning of a global series exploring how FOSS can address critical challenges such as traceability, trust, and collaboration, especially concerning the natural commons in both economic and social systems. We’ll discuss the role of FOSS tools in areas like global carbon emission measurement, climate investment, sustainable branding, accountability, carbon offsets, and local government sustainability efforts, offering innovative ideas and strategies to tackle these issues head-on.</p>\n<p>In addition, we will demonstrate how FOSS, combined with open science methods, can combat greenwashing in the sustainability sector. By applying open and transparent principles, we will show how these approaches can help ensure that environmental claims are accurate and meaningful. This will be illustrated through a number of projects currently under development worldwide, as well as new ideas that we will present and discuss with the broader FOSS community, inviting collaboration and further development. Finally, we will show why openness is the most important indicator of environmental sustainability and explain this using practical examples.</p>",

The plugin architecture has lowered the learning and effort required to onboard new contributors, and has enabled casual experimentation and sharing by educators, hobbyists, and students who might not otherwise get involved in a FOSS project.  Anyone can try out your own ideas as virtual classroom plugins.  Meanwhile, it has also enabled education research on a range of topics including applications of generative AI, learning analytics, effective student engagement, and learning outcomes in online and hybrid teaching.</p>",

If your README sucks, it will be the only doc that person reads before they go away and use a competing project with a better README. In this talk, Emily Omier will give the audience tips for improving the quality of their READMEs, so that they function both as an evangelism tool as well as a way for people new to the project to get started.

To then turn around and send a bill after, because of course people USED it, uploading documents and such. So the lock-in was complete.</p>\n<p>What makes Teams special? It's a complete solution. That is, video calls (think Zoom) + chat (think Slack or IRC) + document sharing (Dropbox) and document editing with MS Office, all in one.</p>\n<p>There are a ton of open source alternatives, but none really answer this challenge, as most focus on one aspect - video calls, chat, document sharing... Some people 'frankensteined' solutions to integrate different tools, but user experience suffers and they are a nightmare to maintain. Open Source needs a singular, capable answer.

    "abstract": "<p>Valence is a programming language written with eight Ancient Greek signs, each a homophone with many meanings. They are defined by context: each can be a command, an expression, or an octal digit. Its valence (number of parameters) and the order it appears determines its meaning, often with little relation to its other potential readings. If a line of code has no brackets to clarify the relation between signs, the program simply splits and both potential readings are carried out simultaneously. In this way, a single program can be a polyglot with many different executions running side by side. To write in Valence is to embrace this ambiguity. This lightening talk will not only show this design's unexpected repercussions, but also how we can mine spoken language to find new approaches to logic and code for creative expression.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Twenty years ago, a group of open-source enthusiasts in Taiwan came together to organize the first COSCUP (Conference for Open Source Coders, Users &amp; Promoters). It began as a small gathering of 200 people, with the goal of uniting Taiwan's open-source community. Today, COSCUP has grown into a major event with over 3,000 participants. Along with its growth, tools and open-source projects were developed to be shared by Taiwan's open-source community—some of which are now being used internationally. This talk will introduce two key shared projects that have emerged from this journey.\n- <strong>OPass (Open Pass &amp; All Pass - Community Checkin with Interactivity Project)</strong> OPass  is a comprehensive event management tool, available as a web app, iOS, and Android application. Its features include self-service ticket scanning, agenda management, real-time notifications, and gamification modules. With simple JSON configuration files, OSS events can seamlessly integrate its API to access these services. Originally adopted by COSCUP, OPass is now widely used by other major events in Taiwan, including HITCON and PyCON TW. To enable its continued distribution on iOS and Android platforms, OCF acts as a non-profit custodian managing the app’s accounts for the community.</p>\n<p><strong>OSCVPass</strong>: Open Source Contributor VIP Pass. A project jointly developed by OCF and the community, connecting open-source contributors across Taiwan. Since its launch in 2019, the project has recorded over 600 contributions. Historically, many OSS events in Taiwan offered free tickets or additional benefits, such as photography services or snack bars, to individuals contributing to open-source projects. However, verifying these contributions required significant effort. OSCVPass simplifies the process by organizing a review committee made up of event organizers and community members. Approved contributors can use their OSCVPass to access these benefits across multiple events throughout the year.</p>\n<p>The OPass App has extended its reach beyond Taiwan, with forks developed in India and interest from local government agencies for their events. OSCVPass, originally centered on OSS events, is now attracting collaborations with technical and commercial events, broadening its scope and impact.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Some of the Linux kernel's more fundamental APIs can be quite old, and some of them have been written in the \"Wild West\" era of the project. Naturally, such an API can accumulate hundreds, sometimes thousands of users. Some APIs haven't been cleanly designed from start to finish, but have grown steadily as the need arose, being written by several authors. Some ended up being used differently than expected.</p>\n<p>Should it later be discovered that the API or its internals have minor or major issues, it cannot be changed anymore without simultaneously changing all the API users across dozens of subsystems, involving dozens of maintainers.</p>\n<p>This implies that touching such an API is not only a technological topic, but also involves a good share of \"kernel politics\": you need to convince maintainers, partition your changes across several kernel releases, figure out a merge plan etc.</p>\n<p>This talk is about such an API improvement process in the PCI subsystem, code for a bus that a lot of drivers rely on. We shall look into the following aspects:\n- How do you know that the honorable old API, and not you, is the problem?\n- Build a strategy to slowly phase the problem out, step-by-step over several kernel releases\n- By being very careful, of course we'll ensure that nothing will explode!\n- ... but things will explode anyways. What then?\n- Maintainer relations 101: How to help the maintainer to easily merge your changes</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>The \"Do No Harm\" principle, well-established in fields like medical research, healthcare, and humanitarian aid, has significant potential to enhance ethical approaches and reduce the negative effects of open research practices and technology. </p>\n<p>As open source/science practices become a norm across different disciplines, it is important to identify, improve awareness of, and reduce its potential negative effects. While efforts like ethical source licenses (like the Do No Harm and Hippocratic License) are yet to become an acceptable legal pathway to enforcing responsible practices in open source, more general adoption and use of the \"Do No Harm\" will help account for societal and environmental implications of research and technology.</p>\n<p>This Birds of a Feather session aims to engage the community in an interactive discussion about the implications of adopting the \"Do No Harm\" principle within open source projects and practices. I will start by introducing a simple framework designed to identify and develop actionable plans to mitigate the negative impacts of open research practices and technology. This framework examines the development and deployment of technology across four critical areas: the actors involved or affected, the dynamics and relationships within impacted communities, the economic realities faced by researchers, and environmental impact. Additionally, I will highlight practical methods for addressing the potential negative consequences of our work, inviting participants to share examples from their work.</p>\n<p>This session is designed to be interactive and will engage participants involved in open source/science, including researchers, designers, contributors, developers, maintainers, and community members who seek to better understand and navigate the ethical challenges of open research and technology. Attendees will gain insights into global disparities in technology and explore how they can share responsibility to ensure their work promotes more equitable benefits by combining open practices with the do-no-harm principle.</p>\n<p>Desired Outcomes:\n1) Increased awareness of the ethical dimensions of open source.\n2) Identification of practical steps for integrating the \"Do No Harm\" principle into open source products and practices.\n3) Formation of a network of stakeholders interested in advancing ethical frameworks in open science.</p>",

This means manufacturing and transporting new ones, which is perhaps the biggest waste of all: hardware production alone can account for over 75% of a device's CO2 emissions over its lifespan.</p>\n<p>Free Software is a solution, and if we work together Windows 10 could truly be the last version of Windows users ever use! Let's take this opportunity to coordinate a global, unified Free Software campaign over the next year to raise awareness about the environmental harm of software-driven hardware obsolescence, at the same time upgrading users from Windows 10 to GNU/Linux directly to keep those devices in use and out of the landfill. Let's think big and act boldly! Campaign organization has already begun, but there is still time to get involved. Help decide what the campaign will look like and how we can best reach our target audience! Let's brainstorm what obstacles for new users exist and how our communities can best address them! Join the BoF to co-ordinate, together.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>The Digital Services Act (DSA) has introduced several transparency provisions for providers of online platforms, strengthening users’ rights to information about the content moderation systems they are subjected to. In particular, online platforms are obliged to inform their users of the content moderation decisions they take and explain the reasons behind those decisions in so-called Statements of Reasons (SoR). To enhance transparency and facilitate scrutiny over content moderation decisions, platforms have to submit these SoRs to a publicly available database, the “<a href=\"https://transparency.dsa.ec.europa.eu/\">DSA Transparency Database</a>\", managed by the European Commission. </p>\n<p>This database allows to track a standardised set of metadata about each content moderation decision (with any personal data removed) taken by providers of online platforms in almost real-time. Its website also offers various tools for accessing, analyzing, and downloading the information related to the content moderation decisions taken by online platforms, contributing to the monitoring of the dissemination of illegal and harmful content online. </p>\n<p>However, due to their size and number of attributes, accessing and analyzing these data has been a significant challenge for researchers. To address this, the Transparency Database team has developed <a href=\"https://code.europa.eu/dsa/transparency-database/dsa-tdb\">dsa_tdb</a>, a Python package that enables users to easily access, analyze, and inspect the Statements of Reasons listed in the Transparency Database. </p>\n<p>This talk will showcase the capabilities of <code>dsa_tdb</code>, highlighting its potential for researchers, policymakers, and civil society organizations. We will demonstrate the wide array of tools that the package (and its containerized application) offers to users featuring different levels of technical knowledge, from quick dashboarding and visualizations to more advanced data processing. We will also show how the package can be used to uncover trends and patterns in platform content moderation activities and discuss the implications of these findings for the development of more transparent and accountable online ecosystems. </p>\n<p>In addition to presenting <code>dsa_tdb</code>, we will also discuss the broader transparency provisions introduced by the DSA, including the database tracking the online platforms’ terms and conditions, the Advertisement repositories, the Transparency reports, and the Transparency Database itself. We will explore how these provisions can be leveraged to promote greater transparency and accountability in the digital services sector, and discuss the challenges and opportunities associated with their implementation.</p>\n<p>You can check the <code>dsa_tdb</code> code repository <a href=\"https://code.europa.eu/dsa/transparency-database/dsa-tdb\">here</a>: https://code.europa.eu/dsa/transparency-database/dsa-tdb</p>\n<p>... as well as its <a href=\"https://dsa.pages.code.europa.eu/transparency-database/dsa-tdb/\">online documentation</a>: https://dsa.pages.code.europa.eu/transparency-database/dsa-tdb/</p>",

On February 7, 2024, France and Germany took a significant step forward by announcing their collaboration towards creating sovereign digital workspaces for their public administrations. This session brings together representatives from DINUM (French Interministerial Digital Directorate) and ZenDiS (the German Centre for Digital Sovereignty), who are co-developing La Suite Numérique (France) and openDesk (Germany). Both initiatives prioritise open-source solutions in developing their respective digital suites. DINUM and ZenDiS thus demonstrate that digital sovereignty relies heavily on close international collaboration. In their joint presentation, they discuss strategies of cooperation between their complementary initiatives, shedding light on potential opportunities for future collaboration within the broader open source community.</p>",

However, which policies would be the right ones to reach the objective? What should governments do: write code, fund code, fund companies, fund maintainers, hire maintainers, whatever? Should they mandate the adoption of European and/or open software by policy? Should they leave everything to the market? The openDesk case can provide some useful insight on what can work in practice. The goal of this discussion will be to touch upon the recent debates surrounding the establishment of a Eurostack while comparing this to the practical realities of the development of open source in the European public sector.</p>\n<p>This discussion will de done together with Alexandra Geese and Alexander Smolianitski.</p>",

While real challenges exist which are causing economic harm to entire sectors, politicians remain focused on social media use-cases. Meanwhile, industry self-regulation is not capable of producing authenticators of sufficiently robust fundamental rights protections. Hardware anchored solutions are beneficial to industries in some member states, while software anchored solutions leave more space for industries in others. </p>\n<p>We will present the arising problems with regards to fundamental rights, national security and the challenge to find solutions for the time until 2031. We will focus on the European situation, while not ignoring the impact of foreign influencers like Mark Zuckerberg and Ashton Kuchner, or the impact of the recent Australian social media ban for children on the attention span of European legislators.</p>",

Defined as open-source software, open data, open AI models, and open content that meet privacy, security, and interoperability best practices, DPGs offer governments the tools to build equitable, transparent, and sustainable digital systems.\nThis session highlights recent advancements in the DPG Standard—the framework for vetting and recognizing DPGs—alongside collaborative efforts, such as UNICEF’s leadership in scaling DPGs globally. It will also explore successful implementations in Europe through a practical example from Primero (UNICEF): A DPG helping social service workers manage sensitive data related to child protection and gender-based violence. </p>\n<p>By focusing on these tools’ adoption and alignment with the DPG Standard, the session will demonstrate how collaboration between organizations and governments is fostering digital sovereignty, interoperability, and public sector innovation in Europe.\nAttendees will gain actionable insights into how the DPG Standard and DPGs like Primero are enabling governments to create scalable, transparent, and resilient digital ecosystems.</p>\n<p>Proposed Format:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Introduction: DPGs and the DPG Standard \nOverview of DPGs, their role in advancing the SDGs, and how the DPG Standard ensures trust, security, and interoperability.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Key updates to the DPG Standard, including:</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>--Enhanced privacy requirements.\n--  Ethical AI provisions for transparency and accountability.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>UNICEF’s Showcase: Primero and their European Implementations</li>\n<li>Highlighting Primero as a transformative DPG for managing child protection and gender-based violence data.</li>\n<li>Success stories of Primero’s implementation in various regions, with a focus on its impact and potential in Europe.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Collaborative efforts between UNICEF, governments, and partners to scale Primero and ensure alignment with the DPG Standard.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Closing Remarks </p>\n</li>\n<li>Summarizing the complementary roles of the DPG Standard, DPG implementations, and collaboration efforts in Europe.</li>\n<li>Closing call to action: Encouraging policymakers and developers to adopt and contribute to DPGs as part of Europe’s digital transformation journey. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>This will be followed up with a fishbowl discussion on how DPGs are being leveraged for Government collaborations.</p>",

In particular, it will be discussed how the European Commission is using the notion of Digital Commons more as a tool to focus policymaking and investment around open technologies, in comparison to the efforts of many other international organisations -- like the UN, World Bank, and others -- which are using the language of Digital Public Goods and using this to guide policy making and investment, particularly in the development and humanitarian sectors. The discussion will give some time to the question of public infrastructures based on open source and real world use cases for DPGs and Digital Commons in Europe. Significant space will be given to audience participation, allowing for questions from, and participation of, the audience.\nThis discussion will include Nicholas Gate, Amreen Taneja and Bolaji Ayodeji.</p>",

These companies control vast amounts of data and exert disproportionate influence over politics and public institutions, leveraging an extractive economic model that undermines digital sovereignty and collective well-being.</p>\n<p>In this talk, I will discuss how Europe can take an active role in promoting open source as a concrete cultural reaction against turbo capitalism. The collaborative model of open source represents an opportunity to build a sustainable and inclusive digital ecosystem, capable of contributing to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and ensuring greater technological sovereignty. Specifically, we will explore the potential of European policies to support open source and limit the disproportionate influence of big tech, while promoting values such as transparency, participatory innovation, and sharing.</p>\n<p>The aim is to stimulate reflection on how Europe can lead the shift toward a technological system that is not only innovative but also fair and democratic through the adoption and promotion of open source software.</p>",

How can they communicate in a common language?</p>\n<p>We discuss how a combination of Cloud Native building blocks that emerged from the Kubernetes ecosystem (kcp and kube-bind, among others) could be used to create the foundation for the next generation of cloud platforms.</p>\n<p>We demonstrate a prototype which meshes together declarative APIs that allows us to consume services across multiple control plane instances, instantiating what we call the “Platform Mesh”. As an outlook, we connect the development of declarative APIs to ongoing European developments coming from the upcoming regulations on switching data processing services from within the Data Act, and possible future legislation fostering interoperability in the cloud native computing landscape.</p>\n<p>This talk is a call for action for how to build the next level of European platforms, addressing key European Union objectives in cloud computing sovereignty and standardization.</p>\n<h2>We will conclude by discussing how this reference architecture aligns with broader EU initiatives in technological sovereignty and cross-border digital service integration</h2>\n<p>Links\n- https://www.kcp.io/ (framework behind platform mesh)\n- https://apeirora.eu/ (project initiative)\n- https://www.ecofed.eu/ (collaborators)</p>",

This talk presents our framework for creating meaningful academic-industry collaboration in open technologies, including staff exchange programs between member companies and universities, targeted career development initiatives, and collaborative open source project development through projectathons and hackathons.\nWe will share our vision for a dynamic ecosystem where private sector membership in GFOSS offers a value proposition that includes direct access to academic research and talent pools, participation in joint research projects, opportunities for private sector staff to engage in academic teaching and research and pathways for commercial adoption of academic open source projects. \nThe framework also addresses practical aspects such as revenue-based tiered membership fees, balanced voting mechanisms, and special provisions for startups. Our primary focus is on creating sustainable, mutually beneficial relationships between academia and industry that advance open source adoption and innovation. Insights gained from GFOSS framework approach will inform future policy proposals at both national and European levels, particularly regarding research funding mechanisms, public procurement specifications, and innovation support programs.</p>",

With the arrival of AI and more real use cases, the need of a strong, competitive Microelectronic industry has arrived and the European Union has realized it's importance and putting more resources to make sure we are in a competitive and self sustaining position in this key technology.\nWhile the field is complex there is a big value add in the design (creation) of chips.</p>\n<p>Investment into microelectronics are high with various parts being used in each project, such as CPU's (Central Processing Units) being the brain of any digital Chip. With RISC-V as an open standard of how to structure that CPU and not for profits such as OpenHW Foundation we can leverage a industry proven, high quality platform, allowing European established players but also startups to jump start their time to market by re-using and sharing proven building blocks, saving time and money and allowing much more testing and also potential interaction between companies and research units.</p>\n<p>Programs such as Tristan or Isolde, initiated by the Chips JU are a proven way to build the base for a sovereign and independent yet innovative European Union and we will highlight some cases how it is used from big players such as Thales or Bosch but also startups like Axelera AI and a variety of small medium Businesses and what was possible so far, while also critical asking: Is it enough and what could be done more?</p>\n<p>In this Talk the OpenHW Foundation a global non profit, Headquartered in Brussels is showing the recent successes especially in Europe, what is ongoing and where we should pay more attention.</p>",

    "abstract": "<h4>Duration:</h4>\n<p>15 minutes (this can be adjusted and shortened if necessary)</p>\n<h4>Format:</h4>\n<p>Speedstorming</p>\n<h4>Context:</h4>\n<p><strong>OSS</strong> has become a <strong>cornerstone of innovation, collaboration, and digital sovereignty</strong> in Europe. However, its widespread <strong>adoption</strong> and <strong>integration</strong> into both public and private sectors <strong>face numerous challenges</strong>. Despite its <strong>benefits</strong>-including enhanced transparency, reduced costs, and technological independence-<strong>various actors</strong>, from corporations to grassroots to public entities, <strong>remain hesitant to adopt OSS solutions</strong>.</p>\n<h4>Objectives:</h4>\n<p>This session will engage the participants in speedstorming exercise to take up one challenge, proposing <strong>one policy action</strong> to reduce the OSS adoption barriers. </p>\n<h4>Expected results:</h4>\n<p>Through insights gathered from this <strong>co-creation session</strong>, the workshop aims to contribute to exchanges with the European Commission’s Units dealing with the European digital ecosystem, providing <strong>grassroots perspectives that reflect the real needs of OSS users and contributors</strong>. The outputs will feed into the work carried out by <a href=\"https://martel-innovate.com\">Martel Innovate</a> and <a href=\"https://digital4planet.org\">Digital for Planet</a> on <strong>EU-funded cooperation projects</strong> in shaping policy roadmaps. They will directly inform projects like <a href=\"https://commons.ngi.eu\">NGI Commons</a>, <a href=\"https://ngi.eu/ngi-projects/ngi4alle/\">NGI4ALL.E</a> and <a href=\"https://nexusforum.eu/\">NexusForum.EU</a>, which aim to bridge the European digital ecosystem and communities with European Commission priorities.</p>\n<h4>Structure:</h4>\n<p>The session will be composed of a short introduction (5 minutes) and an interactive exercise (10 minutes).</p>\n<h4>&gt;     Speakers</h4>\n<p>Monique Calisti (CEO - Martel Innovate and President - Digital 4 Planet) and Francesco Panella (Policy analyst and consultant, Martel Innovate)</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>AI is redefining what it means to be Open Source. While the Open Source Definition (OSD) has safeguarded software freedom for over 25 years, it was built for an era of code, not data-driven AI. Today’s foundation models rely on vast, often proprietary datasets, raising critical questions about openness, transparency, and control. If Open Source is to thrive in this new era, we must reimagine its possibilities—not just in code, but in data and AI itself.</p>\n<p>This BoF will explore Open Source 2.0, a vision for adapting Open Source to the AI-driven future. We’ll discuss the Open Source Alliance (OSA), an official AI Convergence Challenge at the AI Action Summit (Paris, Feb 10-11, 2025), which seeks to build global consensus on Open Source AI ￼. We will also examine efforts to extend the Open Source Definition to explicitly include data, ensuring that AI systems respect the fundamental freedoms to use, study, modify, and share—not only for code, but for the datasets that power them.</p>\n<p>At the same time, there is growing recognition of Open Weight models—AI systems where model weights are published but essential components like training data are not disclosed. To bring clarity, the Open Weight Definition (OWD) has been introduced as a distinct framework that acknowledges these models while differentiating them from Open Source AI ￼. The OSI’s Open Source AI Definition (OSAID) and the EU AI Act both describe Open Weight models more so than Open Source AI in the traditional sense, reflecting the need for clearer language in AI regulation and governance.</p>\n<p>Join us to debate the future of Open Source AI: How do we ensure its integrity? How do we define openness in an age where data is the key input? And how can we prevent the dilution of Open Source principles while fostering real innovation?</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>The sharing of public key information is central to the digital credential security model, but the existing Web PKI with its opaque Certification Authorities and synthetic attestations serves a very different purpose. We propose a new approach to decentralised public key infrastructure, designed for digital identity, in which connections between legal entities that are represented digitally correspond to genuine, pre-existing relationships between recognisable institutions. In this scenario, users can judge for themselves the level of trust they are willing to place in a given chain of attestations. Our proposal includes a novel mechanism for establishing a root of trust in a decentralised setting via independently-verifiable timestamping. We also present an open source reference implementation built on open networks, protocols and standards. The system has minimal setup costs and is freely available for any community to adopt as a digital public good.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Collaboration on public sector Open Source Software (OSS) projects is steadily increasing along with demands for sovereign and interoperable technology stacks. Still, the practice has yet to catch up compared to industry and the broader OSS ecosystem, whose ways of working need to be tailored to manage the many challenges and restraints falling on the public sector. Examples we've come across include the dependency on sourcing of technical expertise, rigorous public procurement frameworks, risk-aversive and self-centric culture, and limited forums for collaboration. </p>\n<p>To help accelerate the public sector's use and development of OSS, we therefore investigated six successful cases of public sector OSS projects from different countries and levels of government. In this talk, we will provide insights on how development is commonly concentrated and performed with the use of national and local service providers. We will talk about different funding models, either involving one or a few central actors, or a wider set through different setups of crowd-funding. We will further elaborate on sustainability challenges related to the various ways of working, and potential approaches to addressing these proactively. </p>\n<p>Attendees will walk away with concrete and live examples to reference, as well as insights on how their organizations can start to engage and collaborate on new and existing public sector OSS projects. The presentation will further help to provide framing and input to other presentations within the devroom and hallway talks, stimulating knowledge sharing and growing a community of practice.</p>",

This process informed a revised edition of the handbook, highlighting the diverse needs of public administrations across Europe. These knowledge-sharing efforts are essential to foster collaboration among governments, as they help provide the necessary competences for government to collaborate.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Launched by the Barcelona City Council in 2016, the Decidim Barcelona project was initially created to coordinate the Municipal Action Plan, a participatory initiative aimed at strategically planning the city's projects for the next four years. In its early stages, Decidim was managed directly by the City Council, but over time, it became clear that an independent entity was needed to ensure the project's sustainability and facilitate its adoption and reuse by other governments.</p>\n<p>To address this, the Decidim Association was established on February 16, 2019, during an extraordinary assembly. It was created as the governance body for the Decidim community, with the City Council transferring the management and maintenance of the source code to the Association through a formal agreement.</p>\n<p>This public-common collaboration is an example of how to design the governance of digital commons. It is a unique example in the world of how to implement free software as a public policy with a community governance model.</p>\n<p>In this session, we will explore how the Decidim Association collaborates with governments worldwide, focusing on three key aspects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Technological Governance</strong>: Defining the roadmap and identifying needs.</li>\n<li><strong>Reuse and Adaptation of the Framework</strong>: Tailoring Decidim for diverse governmental contexts.</li>\n<li><strong>Challenges and Lessons Learned</strong>: Insights from working with governments globally.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This talk is ideal for those interested in learning how public organizations can develop FLOSS solutions and the best practices for implementing them with a community governance model.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>WireGuard is a great protocol to set up a virtual private network (VPN). However, the challenge is to make it work on networks that block or mangle user datagram protocol (UDP) traffic. Certain hotspots, such as those at hotels, events, cafes &amp; restaurants block UDP traffic and only allow web traffic over the transmission control protocol (TCP) usually port 80/443. Even if a network allows UDP traffic, there can be issues with certain packets not going through due to issues regarding maximum transmission units (MTU).</p>\n<p>Supporting TCP is left explicitly out of scope for the WireGuard project and should be handled by an upper layer obfuscation tool [1]. There is a good reason for this: TCP-over-TCP has bad performance (e.g. website traffic over a TCP VPN). However, in these networks the choice has to be made between no VPN connectivity or at least something as a fallback. For this reason, there are some tools which aim to proxy UDP packets over TCP.</p>\n<p>Many of these tools, however, do not directly allow you to put it behind a reverse proxy. The advantage of using a reverse proxy is that you can use your existing web server to (next to tunneling it over TCP) obfuscate the traffic with TLS and tunnel your WireGuard traffic through the same port that is serving normal websites. In this talk, I will introduce a tool called ProxyGuard which aims to solve this use case. I explain why I came up with this approach in the first place, what challenges I had implementing it and possible improvements for the future. The project homepage is at: https://codeberg.org/eduvpn/proxyguard</p>\n<p>1: https://www.wireguard.com/known-limitations/</p>",

We will delve into the architecture and capabilities of BlueField SmartNICs, demonstrating their potential (and limitations) when offloading tasks such as network traffic processing, inline security applications, traffic shaping. Shifting these workloads to the adapter is desirable as it frees up host resources, and enables more efficient and scalable network operations. Attendees will gain insights into the practical deployment of BlueField DPUs in modern network infrastructures and learn best practices for leveraging DOCA Flow to optimize network observability and control.</p>",

Real-world examples based on nDPI, an open-source DPI toolkit, will illustrate their use in intrusion detection, anomaly detection, and network monitoring, as well as other open-source tools such as Wireshark and Suricata.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Every Internet Service Provider on the face of the Earth needs to use a Quality of Experience middle-box on their network. A middle-box gives you visibility into your network: latency, jitter and bufferbloat only become apparent when you look. Spot congestion and latency spikes at every level of the network. A middle-box gives you proactive monitoring: identify the customers who are having problems before they call you. And most importantly, a middle-box gets rid of support calls. By actively managing bufferbloat, enhancing perceived latency and proactively pacing packets you can immediately improve your customers’ quality of experience. In our experience, this massively reduces the volume of support calls-and costs to service them. A Quality of Experience middle-box allows also for more aggressive but safer over-subscription rate. PS: Bandwidth is a lie.</p>",

With <strong>EVP pipeline support</strong>, the DPDK crypto driver allows <strong>enqueueing of multiple TLS packets for encryption/decryption</strong>, leveraging DPDK burst APIs. Enhanced <strong>queue management</strong> further boosts efficiency.</p>\n<h2>Key Features:</h2>\n<p><strong>Engine Registration</strong>: Supports multiple engines with specific algorithms for asynchronous operations.\n<strong>User Space Driver</strong>: Uses DPDK and OpenSSL Engine for hardware-offloaded, user space TLS processing.\n<strong>Event Handling</strong>: Employs an event-driven model for dynamic event management.\n<strong>Polling Mechanism</strong>: Monitors asynchronous operations with dedicated polling functions.\n<strong>Callback Functions</strong>: Handles completion of TLS operations efficiently.\n<strong>Queue Management</strong>: Separates handshake requests from read/write events, reducing contention and improving throughput and latency.</p>\n<h2>Advantages:</h2>\n<p><strong>Reduced Contention</strong>: Separate queues for different operations enhance smooth processing.\n<strong>Increased Throughput</strong>: Parallel processing of operations boosts the number of TLS operations per second.\n<strong>Lower Latency</strong>: Faster processing of time-sensitive handshake operations.</p>\n<p>These improvements make the <strong>VPP TLS plugin a robust solution for high-throughput, low-latency network environments</strong>.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>In a Cloud-Native world, you eat Kubernetes Services at breakfast, you go through the morning one YAML object at a time, and by the end of the afternoon you've spun clusters by the dozen. Juggling with public cloud resources such as AWS or GKE is a second nature for you. But here's the thing: you realized that your bill would be much smaller over time if you could run your workflows on your own hardware. Maybe you even have requirements for low latency that can't be addressed by external providers. Say you've bought your commodity switches, new servers, perhaps some GPUs. It's great! But now... what? How, exactly, do you turn these into a cloud infrastructure similar to what you'd get from the large providers?</p>\n<p>Time to turn to the <a href=\"https://docs.githedgehog.com\">Open Network Fabric</a>. This is an open-source, vendor-agnostic project, that aims at bringing the user experience from public cloud providers to private environment. It provides tooling and automation around SONiC, an open-source network operating system based on Linux that runs on switches. The Open Network Fabric is built around the concept of Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) and provides a multi-tenant API to define the user intent on network isolation and connectivity, which is automatically transformed into configuration for switches and software appliances. It also leverages the Kubernetes APIs: all user-facing APIs are Kubernetes Custom Resources (CRDs), so one can use standard Kubernetes tools to manage resources such as VPCs, network attachments, and even switches and servers.</p>\n<p>This talk is an introduction to the Open Network Fabric, with a high overview of the different components and on how to use it to set up a VPC. After presenting the current state of the project, we'll also take a look at a few roadmap items for the associated DPDK-based Gateway, currently at an early stage of development.</p>\n<p>Bring back the Cloud to your home (or lab): compute on the edge, connect your endpoints and VPCs with the Open Network Fabric. And if you feel like it, join the project!</p>",

However, Source Load Balancing (balance-slb) is only supported by OpenvSwitch. SLB bonding allows load balancing without remote switch's knowledge or cooperation. SLB assigns each source MAC+VLAN pair to a link and transmits all packets from that MAC+VLAN through that link. Now this is also available on kernelspace by a combination of nftables rules and kernel bonding configuration, all automated through NetworkManager balance-slb option.</p>\n<p>On this talk, we will explore how SLB balancing works and how it was implemented by using nftables and kernel bond driver. In addition, we will explore scenarios where this is useful and some known problems.</p>",

Joining them to an identity management domain can help with that, and automatically joining them is even better. Learn how the Podengo project enables automatic and secure enrollment of VMs into a FreeIPA domain. </p>\n<p>FreeIPA is an open source identity management solution providing authentication, access control, and other security features for Linux machines, to help organisations meet their security and compliance objectives. These objectives persist when running workloads on public clouds. But the typical workflow of using SSH keys to access the machine may struggle to meet them.</p>\n<p>Enter Podengo. The Podengo service registers your FreeIPA deployment (which could be on-premises), authenticates cloud VMs, and facilitates an automatic and secure domain enrollment. This presentation will explain how the protocol works, what is required to use it, and how we use the Podengo service to provide the Domain Join feature in Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console (and how you could use it in other settings).</p>\n<p>After covering the fundamentals and current use cases, we will discuss some of the feature gaps (and how to close them), and how we could add support for more identity management solutions.</p>\n<p>This presentation could be particularly useful for system and cloud administrators, infosec people, and the cryptography-curious.</p>\n<p>PS: There will be recorded demos available due to time constraints!</p>\n<p>References:</p>\n<p>https://www.freeipa.org/\nhttps://github.com/podengo-project</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>SSL/TLS certificate management doesn’t have to be a headache. With FreeIPA’s integrated ACME protocol support, you can automate certificate issuance and renewal, simplifying your security workflows while maintaining enterprise-grade reliability.</p>\n<p>In this session, we’ll explore how FreeIPA ACME capabilities can streamline certificate management across diverse environments. From Kubernetes to traditional systems, FreeIPA’s ACME integration empowers organizations to enhance security, reduce manual effort, and ensure uptime. As a practical example, we’ll demonstrate how Kubernetes’ cert-manager Operator can leverage FreeIPA’s ACME capabilities to manage certificates for containerized applications. This is just one of many possible integrations enabled by FreeIPA’s robust feature set.</p>\n<p>The ACME protocol allows automated interactions between certificate authorities and your servers so you can automate the deployment of your public key infrastructure at a low cost, with relatively little effort. ACME protocol combined with the new features incorporated in the last release of mod_md make it so easy to have a completely automated environment to manage the renewal of the certificates of your webservers. Using the ACME feature of FreeIPA integrated with mod_md you can manage multiple security sites in a  completely automated and scalable way without any external dependencies so you will never need to be concerned about common topics such as: when to perform the operation, possible disruptions, long times waiting for the CA to sign your certificates or any kind of problems you experienced in the past. Mod_md also includes several fine tuning mechanisms about when to perform the operations to make the server aware of any issue in your certs.  We will also review them and this combined with appropriate monitoring reduces the renewal operation to the minimum.</p>\n<p>Whether you manage Kubernetes, hybrid infrastructure, or standalone systems, FreeIPA offers a flexible and scalable approach to SSL/TLS management. Join us to uncover how FreeIPA’s ACME support can transform your certificate lifecycle management, improving security posture with minimal complexity no matter your applications are running on top of Kubernetes or on Apache. Don’t miss the opportunity to master certificate automation with FreeIPA!</p>",

This talk outlines the progress made toward achieving IPA-IPA trust, a feature that mirrors existing integration with Active Directory (AD) but adapts to modern, self-sufficient deployments that may not rely on traditional AD infrastructure.</p>\n<p>IPA-IPA trust leverages Kerberos cross-realm authentication to establish secure relationships between distinct FreeIPA domains and allows seamless access to resources across trusted environments. Building on existing support for AD trusts, the approach reuses proven mechanisms in <a href=\"https://github.com/freeipa/freeipa\">FreeIPA</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/SSSD/sssd\">SSSD</a> to resolve identities, enforce access policies, and manage trusted domain configurations. This includes adapting Kerberos authorization data extensions to securely exchange identity details and group membership information, which FreeIPA already utilizes for AD trusts.</p>\n<p>Key developments include enhancing SSSD to support multiple subdomain types, enabling it to handle IPA-specific identity structures, and introducing new mechanisms to facilitate identity information retrieval across trusted IPA domains. Initial experiments demonstrate the viability of this approach, with prototypes and Fedora-based builds available for testing. </p>\n<p>This talk highlights the technical challenges, solutions, and <a href=\"https://vda.li/posts/2024/05/31/ipa-ipa-trust-progress/\">progress achieved</a> so far, offering insights into the collaborative efforts that aim to extend FreeIPA’s trust capabilities.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Logical replication in PostgreSQL is great for multiple use cases such major upgrades with nearly-zero downtime, consolidation of multiple databases into a warehouse, and more recently, bi-directional replication for geo-redundancy, with the promise of an active-active architecture. All these possibilities are evidence that logical replication is far richer than physical replication. However, that richness comes with higher complexity and nuances that makes it challenging. Oh yeah, and that’s fun, isn’t it?</p>\n<p>In this presentation we will not just discuss in theory the nuances and challenges, we will have a live session analysing different scenarios, reviewing best and worst practices, breaking the replication and fixing it, so that the publisher database keeps on streaming, keeping the beat.</p>\n<p>Logical replication is complex, but as the Zen of Python says, “better complex than complicated”.</p>",

The organisation wants to use this data to answer real-world business questions such as “what percentage increase in sales did we see as a result of this marketing campaign?”.</p>\n<p>This means you need to run analytics queries (OLAP activity) against the data; complex queries that work on large data sets and are therefore very resource intensive.</p>\n<p>How can you do that without compromising the performance of your application?</p>\n<p>Let’s look at some of the ways that you can design your environment and tune your database to work with this hybrid (OLTP + OLAP) workload.

    "abstract": "<p>Short abstract\nUnderstanding table-level locks in Postgres is a quite useful skill as almost all DDL operations require acquiring one of the different types of table-level locks on the object being manipulated. If not managed well, schema changes can result in downtime. In this talk we will explain fundamentals of table-level locking, covering how different types of locks are applied and queued during schema changes. Attendees will learn how to identify and manage lock conflicts to minimize downtime, avoid deadlocks, and maintain smooth database operations, even during high-concurrency schema changes.</p>\n<p>Long abstract\nIn PostgreSQL, managing schema changes without downtime can be a challenging task. Table-level locks, which control access during Data Definition Language (DDL) operations like ALTER or DROP TABLE, can result in unintended application slowdowns or even service interruptions when not fully understood. This talk will provide a comprehensive dive into table-level locking and lock queueing in PostgreSQL, helping attendees gain the insights they need to perform efficient schema changes.</p>\n<p>We’ll start by explaining the various types of table-level locks in PostgreSQL such as Access Share, Exclusive, and Access Exclusive and how they are automatically managed during common DDL operations. Then, we’ll break down lock queuing: how PostgreSQL organizes lock requests, what happens when transactions wait for locks, and how deadlocks can arise in complex environments.</p>\n<p>Next, we’ll focus on practical approaches to managing table-level locks for near-zero downtime. Attendees will learn techniques to minimize locking impact, including understanding lock conflicts, using online schema migration patterns, and identifying lock-heavy queries. We’ll introduce open-source tools like pgroll, which utilizes the expand/contract pattern to make schema changes in small, lock-free steps.</p>\n<p>By the end of this session, attendees will be equipped with practical strategies and knowledge to control lock behavior during schema changes, ensuring data integrity and reducing operational disruptions. This talk will provide the tools needed to manage PostgreSQL schema changes with confidence and minimal impact on production environments.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>BZip2 is a famous and powerful lossless data compression format.\nIt is very good on some data, like English novels or computer source code.\nAn outstanding aspect of BZip2 is its simplicity.\nNo tricky hash trees or convoluted state machines.\nHowever, compression software is generally very difficult to debug, in part impossible.\nSo it is better to do things right the first time and use a language that does its best finding errors before running your program.\nI show you how I built a working encoder in a few days by leveraging the precise and customisable type system in Ada, especially range types that seem to have been made for this kind of software.</p>",

Most of the time this is due to languages not implementing such concepts or the way they are taught and presented make them seem a lot more technical and not-so-practical.\nIn this talk, I would like to explain what liquid types, contracts and proving code are. The examples will use the Ada programming language as it supports all of these features out of the box and it is a very easy to read and understand language. The examples given will also try to show the practicality of these features, as they are a set of wonderful techniques that tend to be overlooked in \"real world\" programs.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>With the increased use of small robots in human households like vacuum robots the next logical step is the introduction of more complex robots which are capable of manipulating objects. Introducing such robots into human household poses a multitude of new challenges, they need to operate in dynamically changing environments while being aware of their surrounding to avoid accidents. Furthermore, they need to be able to reason about the outcome of actions and change their behavior accordingly, to name a few. \nPyCRAM is a framework to design high-level cognition enabled robot behavior, designed to address the aforementioned challenges of deploying robots in human households. This is done by providing tools to define a robot control plan, which is written as high-level human instructions like \"go to the table\" or \"pick up the cup\". PyCRAM is then able to translate these instructions to instructions for a robot while taking the current context the robot is operating in into account. Resulting in robot behavior which is constantly adapting to the current state of the environment and context.</p>\n<p>You can find the framework on GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/cram2/pycram\">PyCRAM</a></p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Although ROS is an amazing platform it can also be frustrating, especially for a hobby-roboticist like me. From packages only being available in one specific ROS version, to dependencies which don’t compile on your specific linux version, some problems already start when trying to install your software. But that is just the start for the hobby-roboticist. The flexibility of ROS theoretically allows for cheap robots to be built, but in practice it’s hard to get your odometry, mapping, and movements in general set up correctly if you don’t have any of the more standard supported platforms. \nIn this talk I will go over my experience with ROS as a hobby roboticist, give tips to the developer community, and will introduce a new ROS package to make it more affordable to get started with robotics.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>In the world of robotics, simulations have become an essential tool for developing, testing, and deploying robotic systems. But what exactly is simulation, and why is it so transformative? A simulation is a virtual environment that emulates robot behavior and interactions with the world, using mathematical models to replicate physics, sensors, and actuators. By eliminating the need for expensive or inaccessible hardware, simulation empowers developers everywhere to create, refine, and scale their robotics applications.</p>\n<p>This talk explores how open-source general-purpose simulators (like Gazebo, Webots, O3DE, etc.) are breaking barriers in robotics development. From reducing costs and improving safety to accelerating development cycles and enabling large-scale testing, simulations are revolutionizing the field. Importantly, they are fostering inclusivity by providing accessible tools for regions with limited access to robotics hardware, such as Argentina and other less than well-resourced areas.</p>\n<p>We’ll discuss the critical factors to consider when choosing a simulator, including its focus, community support, and compatibility with open-source tools. We’re excited to invite you to join us and discover how open-source simulations are democratizing robotics, empowering developers, and shaping the future of this exciting field.</p>\n<p>Plan for the talk (20 minutes + 5 minutes of discussions and questions):</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Introductions</li>\n<li>Robots and simulators\n   2.1 What is a robotic system?\n   2.2 What is a robotic simulator?\n   2.3 What can I do with a robotic simulator?</li>\n<li>Picking the right tool for the job\n   3.1 How to pick a robotic simulator?\n   3.2 One robot, many simulators: Gazebo, Webots, O3DE, MuJoCo, Flatland</li>\n<li>Discussion and questions</li>\n</ol>",

Additionally, it will explain why it has been chosen as an alternative middleware for ROS 2 and how it unlocks a series of use cases that were extremely hard to implement before. Finally the talk will give an overview of what's coming next with Zenoh for robotic and beyond.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>These days it is easy to design your own AI hardware accelerators using cheap FPGA boards and open source tooling. It's even possible to turn these into ASICs using open source technology.\nBut how do you get such designs to integrate into your favourite open source AI tooling?\nIn this talk we'll take you end-to-end through the process of designing custom AI hardware and  integrating it into standard AI workflows, all using open source technology. We will cover:\n* Designing your open AI hardware by extending the open RISC-V instruction set\n* Creating a software layer to interface with and program it via OneAPI and the SYCL parallel programming language\n* Integrating this software layer with existing open AI tooling</p>\n<p>This talk draws on our experience with a number of projects at Southampton University and with companies developing next generation AI accelerators.</p>",

This includes <a href=\"https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit\">NVIDIA CUDA</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/ROCm/ROCm\">AMD ROCm</a>, <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/tpu/\">Google TPU</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/de/ai/machine-learning/neuron/\">AWS Neuron</a> accelerator runtimes, or even a CPU. The process also includes pushing the image to your container registry—all in one command. Identical executable, single image.</p>\n<p>We’ll also go into the lengths <a href=\"https://github.com/zml/zml\">ZML</a> goes to in downloading and auto-packaging only the absolute essentials of the chosen runtimes at build-time, such as CUDA, ROCm, etc, significantly reducing the size of the built artifact, whether it’s an OCI image or a .tar file.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/zml/zml\">ZML</a> is also developer-friendly, automatically providing the Zig compiler, language server, and pre-configured setups for <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/\">VS Code</a> and <a href=\"https://neovim.io/\">NeoVim</a>. Its use of <a href=\"https://ziglang.org\">Zig</a>, a systems programming language with low-level control and robust abstractions, supports efficient memory management, error handling, and software correctness—key factors for production-grade solutions.</p>\n<p>With this talk, we’d like to share our excitement about <a href=\"https://github.com/zml/zml\">ZML</a>, its unique approach to simplifying the complexities of delivering production-ready AI systems, and how it enables developers to efficiently transition from development to deployment.</p>",

Previously, the sheer size of LLMs, requiring massive GPUs and RAM, made local deployment impossible for most developers. This reliance on cloud services limited experimentation, customization, and affordability.</p>\n<p>My presentation focuses on Llama.cpp, an inference engine enabling efficient execution of LLMs, including Meta's Llama, Qwen, and Mistral models, on CPUs. </p>\n<p>I detail the process of acquiring, building, and quantizing models for local use, showcasing how Ruby bindings and a built-in HTTP server simplify interaction.  I also introduce two open-source tools I've created: Llamagator and Rspec-Llama. </p>\n<p>Llamagator is a Rails application, streamlines the management, testing, and comparison of various LLMs, both local and cloud-based. With it, you can create prompts, define assertions, and evaluate model performance and easily implement pattern of LLM-as-a-judge.</p>\n<p>Rspec-Llama extends Rspec with a specialized DSL for interacting with and validating responses from LLMs, making it easier than ever to integrate these models into testing workflows. These tools, combined with the ability to run LLMs locally, empower developers to explore AI's potential without relying on external providers.</p>",

The MOF aims to prevent misrepresentation of models claiming to be open, to guide researchers and developers in providing all model components under permissive licenses, and to help individuals and organizations differentiate models that are truly open from those that are not.\nThis session will give attendees an overview of the MOF and practical information on how they can use it along with the <a href=\"https://mot.isitopen.ai/\">Model Openness Tool (MOT)</a> to find out which models are really open and evaluate how their own models line up with the MOF.</p>",

Unlike LLMs which are limited by the data they were trained on, agents use external tools to obtain up-to-date information, optimize workflow and create subtasks autonomously to achieve complex goals. Our speakers, seasoned experts in AI and Kubernetes, will share insights into the benefits of using Kubernetes for deploying AI agents and provide best practices for designing and implementing them using open source tools. We'll do a deep dive on the Bee Agent Framework, which makes it easy to build scalable agent-based workflows with your model of choice. We will show how to use Instructlab to add specialized knowledge to an existing model without the need for fully fork and fine-tune. Don't miss out on this opportunity to level up your AI skills and learn how to create intelligent agents that can interact with users and perform various tasks. See you there!</p>",

Scaling your solution as your team grows.\n  2.  Supporting models beyond LLMs, such as using diffusion models for role-playing applications, TTS models for NotebookLM equivalents, rerankers and embeddings for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and more.</p>\n<p>Today, both models and inference engines are highly diverse and rapidly evolving, while GPU resources remain fragmented and heterogeneous.

    "abstract": "<p>Tool use or function calling is one of the key features required to realize the promises of agentic applications. While it is still a novelty with a lot of experimentation and variation among model providers, protocols such as the OpenAI function calling extensions of the chat completions API have become a standard for a specific case of tool calling. In this talk we're going to explain how function calling works all the way from the API endpoint down to the actual model prompt. We're going to explore the different kinds of interaction flows that are possible with this protocol and what the current limitations are.</p>",

Both Large Language Models and other generative models for image/video/sound use huge deep learning models, running on expensive and energy intensive GPUs. However there are several other application areas of machine learning, operating under other contraints. One of these is the area of \"TinyML\", where machine learning is used to analyze sensor data on microcontroller-grade systems. A typical TinyML system is under 1 watt, under 1 MB of RAM and FLASH and under 10 USD bill-of-materials.</p>\n<p>emlearn is an open-source project started in 2018, which provides machine learning inference implementations for microcontrollers. It is written in portable C99 code, and supports models trained with scikit-learn and Tensorflow/Keras. Since 2023 the emlearn project also provides bindings for MicroPython, a Python for microcontrollers.</p>\n<p>In this talk we will talk about machine learning on microcontrollers; the applications, developments in the field over the last years, and current trends - both on software and hardware side. This niche of machine learning is extremely concerned with computational efficiency, and we believe that these perspectives may be useful also to developers working in different areas.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>We described our idea of a guest virtual machine driven firmware update mechanism for confidential cloud deployments (where tenant and cloud providers are two different entities) in our KVM Forum talk 2024 titled “Empowering confidential VMs in the cloud to use their own firmware upon instantiation.” [1] . We already demoed a prototype in action at KVM Forum [4]. In this talk, we will briefly describe our motivation for this work for the benefit of those not present in the KVM Forum. Then, we will argue how signed UKIs can be a simple, easier and guest OS agnostic means of deploying the trusted and measured firmware images for tenants in the cloud. We will also describe how UKIs can trigger an update of the firmware using our proposed simple hypervisor interface. Discussions around implementing this have already started within the systemd community [2][5]. We will describe some of the details around our design decisions. We will also seek inputs from the community on implementing the hypervisor specific support needed in UKI for interacting with the hypervisor by proposing some initial ideas.</p>\n<p>This talk is mostly UKI/systemd focussed. We will not describe QEMU specific details. For QEMU details, those interested may please refer to our 2024 KVM Forum talk and other future presentations at the KVM Forum or other conferences.</p>\n<p>This work is being driven within Red Hat in collaboration with AWS.

    "abstract": "<p>Confidential VMs are generally available on popular public clouds today and on-premise hypervisor solutions are trying to catch up. The main selling point of the technology is the assumed ability to isolate guests from the owner of the infrastructure thus gaining true confidentiality. Are we there yet? In the talk I will try to describe (from a general purpose Linux based operating system perspective) what would it take to build full chain of trust. In particular, I'd like to discuss the following parts: why/how can we trust \nthe hardware, the firmware, the bootloader, the kernel, and the userspace; how we can ensure confidentiality and integrity of the workload.\nThe talk is supposed to be fairly high level with the main purpose to provide an overview of the current state of affairs; highlight parts of the chain where the required solutions are already there, parts, which are 'work and progress', and parts where we've just scratched the surface.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>In the rust-vmm project, we implement VirtIO devices in Rust by following the VirtIO specification that defines how devices and driver interact. For example, the specification outlines the steps that drivers must follow to initialize a device. If a driver makes any incorrect sequence, the device returns an error.\nWhile the driver or device may not always conform to the spec, deviations can lead to unexpected behaviors or bugs. In this presentation, we introduce two tools to check whether a VirtIO device conforms to the specification. Firstly, we present Kani - a tool developed by Amazon that is used to verify conformance in devices implemented in Firecracker. Secondly, we discuss an experimental tool that validates conformance during the execution of the device. This is a Rust tracer that developers can add to an existing device to ensure its implementation conforms to the specification. Traces are compared with the specification at runtime to detect any violations that may have occurred.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>In the <a href=\"https://kubevirt.io/\">KubeVirt</a> architecture, scheduling as well as network and storage management is completely delegated to the underlying Kubernetes cluster, with KubeVirt extending it with virtualization functions.\nWhen developing KubeVirt, we are often faced with a dilemma: should we solve a problem in KubeVirt in a way that is best optimized for VMs, or should we take a more general path and develop or rely on solutions that are also suitable for generic pod-based workloads?\nThe <a href=\"https://kubevirt.io/user-guide/architecture/#the-razor\">KubeVirt razor</a> that states \"if something is useful for Pods, we should not implement it only for VMs” is our guiding principle and has proven to be a wise and smart idea over the years.\nHowever, we still frequently receive questions from experienced users coming from other more traditional virtualization solutions who want to know how they can perform certain scheduling/maintenance activities following patterns that have proven successful for them in the past.\nAn example of these questions is live migrating one of my VMs to a named node as and when I wish bypassing the cluster scheduler decision, or how to automatically and regularly rebalance the cluster according to the real-time resource consumption of my long-lived VMs. In the past, such questions have not found an easy answer in KubeVirt.\nIn this session, we will discuss how to <a href=\"https://github.com/kubevirt/community/pull/320\">extend the VirtualMachineIstanceMigration object to allow the cluster administrator to specify a desired target node</a>.\nWe will then move on to a more advanced use case and discuss why <a href=\"https://docs.kernel.org/accounting/psi.html\">PSI (Pressure Stall Information) metrics</a> collected at node and workload level (cgroupv2) are like barometers that provide fair warning of impending resource shortages (memory, CPU, IO), and how we can proactively leverage this information by using a novel load-aware plugin for the <a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/descheduler\">Kubernetes descheduler</a> that can trigger evictions and live migrations (for VMs) to automatically manage and balance resource utilisation on cluster nodes.\nPlease note that these novel proposals are still controversial and the subject of an interesting discussion between KubeVirt developers. So this talk may be an interesting opportunity for discussion to influence the future development of your preferred virtualization solution.</p>",

This requirement adds complexity to the already challenging Kubernetes networking landscape, and brings into focus the needs for network isolation in Kubernetes, questioning the fundamental decisions for networking in Kubernetes.</p>\n<p>To address these multifaceted issues, the user-defined networks OVN-Kubernetes feature has emerged as a powerful solution. This feature integrates natively with the Kubernetes API, supporting services and network policies while providing the necessary tools for effective traffic isolation and NATed egress implementation. Crucially, it also offers the capability to maintain consistent IP addresses for virtualization workloads, ensuring stability during VM lifecycle events.</p>\n<p>Through a live demonstration, attendees will learn practical steps to implement traffic isolation using OVN-Kubernetes User Defined Networking functionality. Including NATed egress and stable IP addressing for VMs on their clusters. By the session's end, participants will understand how to tailor Kubernetes networking to meet their organization's specific requirements, bridging the gap between Kubernetes' flexible architecture and the stringent networking needs of both traditional virtualization and managed Kubernetes environments. This knowledge will empower attendees to create more effective and secure networking solutions, enabling them to fully leverage cloud-native technologies while maintaining operational security and compliance across diverse deployment scenarios.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>To ensure a competitive market in the EU, customers of data processing services, including cloud and edge services, must be able to switch seamlessly between providers. This benefits customers by allowing them to choose services that best meet their needs, while also benefiting providers by expanding their potential customer base. However, significant barriers currently hinder this flexibility, including high costs for data egress, lengthy switching procedures, and a lack of interoperability between providers, which can lead to the loss of data and applications.</p>\n<p>The Data Act, coming into force on 12 September 2025, aims to address these challenges by ensuring that switching between providers is free, fast, and seamless. This presentation will describe and demonstrate a new open-source virtualization layer developed within the IPCEI-CIS project to further facilitate smooth transitions between data processing services.</p>\n<p>This integrated virtualization system ensures interoperability by providing a control plane that manages distributed resources, virtual machines, and Kubernetes clusters across multiple cloud providers. It also guarantees portability, enabling applications to run seamlessly on any provider without the need for conversion. Additionally, it supports efficient migration of applications between providers with minimal downtime.</p>\n<p>The demo will showcase a testbed combining resources from six EU cloud providers and resources from U.S. providers to illustrate the migration of workloads. This initiative demonstrates how the new virtualization layer enables true flexibility and portability in the cloud ecosystem, driving the vision of a competitive and interoperable cloud market in Europe.</p>",

SEV is an extension of AMD-V technology and allows to run encrypted virtual machines on the top of “untrusted” hypervisor. Even though the hypervisor still controls the lifecycle of virtual machines, it’s up to SEV enabled guest to decide whether its memory is encrypted or not. The SEV enabled hardware ensures that the hypervisor nor other software (VMs) running on the platform can’t access (decrypt) this memory. \nIn the heart of the SEV technology is the “AMD Secure Processor” hardware component which offers an interface to the system software (hypervisor or guest kernels) allowing to manage virtual machines and the whole platform, so these pieces of software can run and communicate without compromising each other’s security.  X86 instruction set was also enriched to fully benefit from SEV technology.\nWe will present our project which targets to integrate SEV extension to Xen hypervisor, the necessary developments and adaptions that have been done, where we are with this project and our future work.</p>",

Does Lennart actually run an image based system himself?!! The answer is no! He runs a mostly stock Fedora system (luckily without grub). So how do we get Lennart onto an image based system? That's where ParticleOS comes in, an image based distribution built completely on top of systemd tooling that intends to implement all of the ideas presented and implemented by Lennart across the years.</p>\n<p>Unlike other image based distributions, ParticleOS focuses on letting users assemble, configure and sign their own image based distribution instead of providing a prebuilt and presigned one that is hard to customize. Users build ParticleOS themselves and sign it with their own keys. As ParticleOS is built with mkosi, any distribution supported by mkosi can be used as the base distribution and users can customize the image to their liking (adding packages, running arbitrary commands, switching to a different filesystem, ...).</p>\n<p>This talk will first expose Lennart, then introduce ParticleOS, compare it to other image based distributions and hopefully convince the listeners that ParticleOS is a good fit for power users looking for a customizable, self-signed image based distribution based on top of all the ideas evangelized by Lennart over the years.</p>\n<p>ParticleOS: https://github.com/systemd/particleos\nmkosi: https://mkosi.systemd.io/</p>",

This is done, similar to Git, using only hashes.  This means that the signature on the UKI effectively signs the whole tree.</p>\n<p>With composefs, file content is split from the metadata which enables de-duplication at the file level. We can thus host any number of OS images on a single filesystem and there is no need to reserve space on the system in advance for each image. This frees us from fixed size disk image formats such as dm-verity which is used in a lot of image based systems.</p>\n<p>We illustrate this architecture by building an OS image using an OCI container via the familiar Containerfile syntax, then pushing it to a container registry and finally deploying it on a system.</p>",

Secure Boot is typically a feature that ensures the integrity of loaded binaries (such as vendor firmware, bootloaders, initramfs and the Linux kernel) to unauthorized modifications of essential boot components. If the bootloader or the Linux kernel does not match with what's expected, the boot process will be halted. After securizing as possible the boot process, there are other methods to enforce the rootfs like using dm-crypt for encryption, dm-verity for integrity...</p>\n<p>This presentation will explore these security features in the context of an embedded operating system called redpesk OS. How can they enhance system security? Can they be applied to specific embedded systems? These are some of the key topics we will cover, with general security features then we'll explain some difficulties we had by deploying boot security features in a restricted environment (old Linux kernel version, CPU &amp; memory usage).</p>",

But all these pieces are neither plugged together by its official installer nor would that help when you need offline-built and signed images.</p>\n<p>The Civil Infrastructure Platform project (https://www.cip-project.org) aims at closing this gap, specifically for Debian use cases in the embedded industrial field, although results are not limited to that.

    "abstract": "<p>As containers continue to reshape how applications are deployed and managed, bootable containers have emerged as the next frontier—extending cloud-native concepts down to the operating system itself. In this talk, we’ll introduce Bootc and explore how it powers image-based OS deployment, boot integrity, and manageability. By leveraging Bootc, the operating system becomes as portable and manageable as a containerized app, bridging traditional OS management with modern DevOps practices.</p>\n<p>We’ll cover \"Image Mode\" for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Fedora, an approach that allows developers, operations teams, and solution providers to manage the entire OS as a container image. Image Mode incorporates the bootc CLI, the main command-line tool for managing updates and other tasks on end devices, along with the bootc-image-builder, which can generate a variety of image types. These include disk images (such as ISOs) suitable for disconnected installations, and virtual disk image formats like QEMU Copy-On-Write (QCOW2), Amazon Machine Images (AMI), and Virtual Machine Images (VMI). This method not only reduces complexity across environments but also enables a unified DevOps approach, integrating seamlessly with container-native tools and CI/CD pipelines. Attendees will learn how image-based deployments address security needs with containerized scanning, validation, and signing tools, and hear about opportunities for standardization within the container ecosystem to ensure boot and operational integrity at scale.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>The German <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bildschirmtext\">Bildschirmtext</a> system was an early large-scale public access information service established in 1983.  Using telephone connections, users would dial in to a central system which offered them with access to commercial and non-commercial offerings.  Television sets were used as display devices, with a set top box or built-in decoder proving the terminal functionality.  Communication was bi-directional with a low-speed back channel that allowed typing in text messages.</p>\n<p>The introduction of Bildschirmtext overlapped with the home computing era, but for regulatory reasons, home computers could not easily be used as Bildschirmtext terminals.  This, among other technical and non-technical reasons, caused the service to fail to reach its full potential.  It remained in use as a carrier system for home banking and other high security applications until it was finally switched off in 2007.</p>\n<p>As Bildschirmtext was a centralized system operated by the federal Deutsche Bundespost on mainframe systems, much of the content that was available has been lost.  A couple of the original data files of the Chaos Computer Club have survived, however, and as the CCC became notorious in the context of Bildschirmtext, that content made for an entertaining exercise in re-engineering.</p>\n<p>In the talk, I will present my journey as a recent Bildschirmtext enthusiast. I will describe how the service was organized, how content providers edited content and put it into the system and how users would access it.  I will also dive into my implementation of a Bildschirmtext terminal emulator in Javascript and a central service system written in Common Lisp, providing the audience with an insight of the challenges, constraints and possibilities of the system.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>The talk tracks the evolution of the peripheral devices that transmit their motion to a cursor - namely mice and trackballs. The analysis covers motion detection methods, the way signals are transmitted to the computer, ergonomics, and ways to test the device with a modern computer. The pre-commercial phase is covered, which includes early marine radar trackballs, Douglas Engelbart's wheel mouse, and Rollkugel ball mouse. The commercial phase is tracked through the following personally studied devices, including early Xerox mice with mechanical and optical encoders, Mouse Systems' design with a simplified optical encoder and reflective mouse pad, Depraz and Apple mice that commercialized the optomechanical encoder, the returns to  Engelbart's original approaches in 1980s analog mice for home computers and wheel mice such as Torrington/Numonics Manager mouse and Hawley DEC mouse, and, finally, the ProAgio Scroll mouse that started the wheel scrolling revolution. Considered connection methods include parallel, serial, serial bus, and analog ones. Surprisingly, all mice and trackballs covered in the talk can be connected to modern computers using open-source converters, which are also examined and discussed.</p>",

But who wants to develop like it’s 1979?</p>\n<p>Cross-compiling for one architecture, while sat in the comfort of another, is nothing new. But these modern tools are specialised, and not always general enough to be packaged with every distribution. Or if they are available today, will they tomorrow? Or do they require extensive dependencies, specific versions, or changes to the host OS and libraries that are incompatible with your day-to-day?</p>\n<p>Docker, first introduced in 2013 (which almost makes it retro itself!), lets us run these tools in a safe  containerised environment that act like a virtual time capsule, providing fully reproducible builds and super-fast turn-around so you can stay in the creative flow.</p>\n<p>In this talk we see two similar projects, ZXDocker and Dragon Docker, to see how simply retro development tools like cross-compilers, assemblers, BASIC→binary converters, and emulators can be combined into a Docker image that results in a one-click workflow.</p>\n<p>Perhaps this will future-proof the retro development process for another 40 years!</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>We are the Museo Interattivo di Archeologia Informatica (MIAI) and the Museo dell’Informatica Funzionante (MusIF), two Italian cultural organizations dedicated to preserving and exploring the history of computing and its societal impact. We focus on creating engaging, interactive exhibits that highlight vintage hardware and software, offering hands-on experiences to captivate visitors of all ages.\nOne of our signature events, Electric Dreams, is an annual gathering for members, supporters, and enthusiasts. In its first four editions, the event centered on the restoration of a General Electric GE-120, a historic computer that represents one of the early successors to Olivetti’s groundbreaking ELEA 9000 series—the first solid-state transistor-based computer in history.</p>\n<p>The computer was used at the Zurich Airport until its decommissioning in 1984. This machine played a key role in early aviation systems and its restoration offers a window into the technological evolution of the 20th century.</p>\n<p>Thanks to the fact that the donor preserved the original manuals—written in four languages, and partially hand written—  our archival team has fully digitalized 57 binders worth of documentation. Meanwhile, the restoration team has focused on following the original testing procedures to validate the components of the CPU.</p>\n<p>Reconstructing the self-test rig has been a critical milestone, enabling efficient identification and replacement of all the parts that tested as defective.</p>\n<p>To complement this effort, we are also developing a full emulator for the GE-120, creating a bridge between its historical operation and modern exploration.\nThis talk will trace the journey of the restoration project, detailing achievements to date and setting the stage for the future.</p>\n<p>With a look ahead to Electric Dreams 2025, usually occurring during the last weekend of July, we invite the audience to join us in sunny Calabria for a hands-on experience with this exciting challenge.</p>\n<p>https://github.com/MusIF-MIAI/ge-120-test-rig/</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Interactive GPU workloads, such as Jupyter notebooks and generative AI inference are becoming increasingly popular in scientific research and data analysis.\nHowever, efficiently allocating expensive GPU resources in multi-tenant environments like Kubernetes clusters is challenging due to the unpredictable usage patterns of these workloads. Container checkpointing was recently introduced as a beta feature in Kubernetes and has been extended to support GPU-accelerated applications. In this talk, we present a novel approach to optimizing resource utilization for interactive GPU workloads using container checkpointing. This approach enables dynamic reallocation of GPU resources based on real-time workload demands, without the need for modifying existing applications. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through experimental evaluations with a variety of interactive GPU workloads and present preliminary results that highlight its potential.</p>",

YODA (Yet more Objects for Data Analysis) addresses this challenge by providing a lightweight, C++-based histogramming library optimised for HPC use cases. In this talk, we’ll delve into YODA’s design principles and its approach to memory efficiency and parallel processing. We’ll discuss how YODA’s architecture supports large-scale histogramming workflows in data-intensive fields, with particular focus on LHC data analysis applications. Through examples, we’ll demonstrate YODA’s ability to handle high-throughput demands, leveraging modern C++ features to ensure compatibility with HPC and GPU architectures. This session will be of interest to developers and researchers working in high-performance data analysis who seek efficient, open-source solutions for handling complex datasets in resource-intensive environments.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>We present DynaModERA, an open-source Python package to perform Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) at scale on the publicly available ERA5 dataset, the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1940 to present. DMD is a popular technique for data-driven modeling of a variety of dynamical systems due to its simplicity and interpretability. In contrast to state-of-the-art deep learning models for data-driven weather prediction, such as those developed by NVIDIA, Huawei and Google DeepMind, DMD is a computationally inexpensive algorithm that provides a best-fit, linear characterization of a non-linear dynamical system, and generates explainable and interpretable results in the form of spatial modes with temporal evolution. These modes often have physical meaning that align with the underlying physics of the problem.</p>\n<p>A common limitation of DMD is its inability to handle large datasets. DynaModERA addresses this challenge by enabling DMD on big weather data through the generation of low-rank approximations of ERA5 and the construction of smaller DMD models for different temporal subsamples. These models are then combined into a unified framework, allowing for stable predictions across all time scales. DynaModERA also provides a comprehensive pipeline for the entire process, including downloading appropriate ERA5 slices from the cloud, data versioning and tracking using Data Version Control (https://dvc.org/) , producing low-rank approximations at scale, and generating DMD models and predictions. By applying DMD to extensive portions of the ERA5 dataset, DynaModERA not only establishes a benchmark for comparing more advanced data-driven weather prediction models but also provides valuable physical insights through DMD modes, which can be used as input features for deep learning models.</p>",

The talk highlights the interoperability of the programming models (HIP, OpenMP®, OpenCL™) with the supported languages (C, C++, Fortran), given the common compiler infrastructure. The talk summarizes the different compilers that AMD provides to address the confusion and point users to the correct compiler for their application. Since programming environments are not complete without libraries, the talk also showcases available libraries, such as rocBLAS. The talk provides a high-level overview together with examples on how to use the different approaches.</p>\n<p>First, it covers some fundamentals of GPU programming and the execution model of HIP. It then shows how to construct an easy HIP kernel from scratch. This is followed by a look at the HIPIFY tool to port codes from CUDA to HIP. Second, the talk covers OpenMP® as GPU programming model in both C++ and Fortran. It highlights the difference between HIP and OpenMP® when it comes to control and convenience. Third, the C++ stdpar capability of ROCm™ is presented to highlight that the user can write pure C++ programs while still benefiting from GPU offload via compiler magic. Lastly, an example is given on how libraries can be used to offload the most relevant computation to the GPU without the need to write GPU kernel code at all.</p>\n<p>All components mentioned in the talk are open-source, with most of the actual compiler work being done in the upstream llvm-project.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>ReFrame is the tool of choice of many data centers and vendors alike when it comes to HPC cluster validation, ranging from small university clusters to large national supercomputers. Despite its highly capable test programming API and its feature-rich runtime, it has always delegated the post-processing of the test results to the user, requiring homegrown site-specific solutions for post-processing. In this talk we will present our recent contribution to ReFrame that enables support for basic analysis of past performance results. All the information about the test cases that have run in a session is stored in a backend database and a new set of CLI options are added for querying, analyzing and comparing past results. We will also discuss how we make use of this feature in our highly dynamic data center environment.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>While digitalisation leads to ever growing data collections, exploiting the full potential of these data collections remains a challenge. Relevant data is difficult to find and it's not easy to use either. At the same time making data available such that others can find and (re)use them is cumbersome. For more than a decade various approaches - technical, organisational, cultural - are followed to help improve the situation, yet at best one witnesses isolated solutions and for many research data management remains a hassle. </p>\n<p>Solving challenges of Research Data Management (RDM) requires coordinated efforts of many parties involved. What happens often is that research projects start by writing down a Data Management Plan (DMP), then do their research and at the end struggle making their data publicly available as required by publishers and research funders.</p>\n<p>This talk proposes extensions to EESSI - the European Environment for Scientific Software Installations (pronounced as \"easy\", https://eessi.io) - to help improve research data management. EESSI provides a large software stack of hundreds of software installations that are streamed on-demand to client systems. It combines several FOSS tools including CernVM-FS (https://cernvm.cern.ch/fs/), Gentoo Prefix (https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:Prefix), EasyBuild (https://easybuild.io) and Lmod (https://lmod.readthedocs.io/) to build a service that can be used by anyone on any Linux machine anywhere in the world. A user just needs to install and configure a small client on his/her system and is ready to do science - analysing or generating data - within a few minutes.</p>\n<p>A key building block of EESSI is its compatibility layer which provides system-level tools and libraries for basic functions such as file management, process creation, and so on. The compatibility layer uses Gentoo that is installed under a prefix. For each of the CPU families supported by EESSI - x86_64 and aarch64 (and soon riscv64) - EESSI just needs a single common installation of Gentoo. Because Gentoo is built from sources, extending a few functions in that layer is particularly easy and everyone who uses EESSI would be enabled to use these extensions.</p>\n<p>Extending core functions of EESSI's compatibility layer facilitates the logging of data accesses (which process accesses what data and when) and simplifies access to remote data (data that is not already present where the data processing should happen).</p>\n<p>Logging information about data accesses facilitates the creation of data flow graphs which can be used for optimisation, reproducibility, and in particular to automate the description of how results such as diagrams, tables, other data products were obtained. Detailed descriptions may help others to understand how the data was processed, to apply the processing to new data or to modify the processing to their needs.</p>\n<p>Today, more and more data sets are published and associated with a persistent identifier. Instead of downloading data sets in a separate step and then processing them, the EESSI compatibility layer can be extended such that data sets can be accessed directly via persistent identifiers. While it may seem like a small improvement, this would enrich the logging information. Without any further steps by a researcher the used data sources would be identifiable and they could be cited automatically. Reproducing results would be improved and last but not least those who published the data would be acknowledged more easily.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Cloud and HPC increasingly converge in hardware platform capabilities and specifications, nevertheless still largely differ in the software stack and how it manages available resources. The HPC world typically favors Slurm for job scheduling, whereas Cloud deployments rely on Kubernetes to orchestrate container instances across nodes. Running hybrid workloads is possible by using bridging mechanisms that submit jobs from one environment to the other. However, such solutions require costly data movements, while operating within the constraints set by each setup’s network and access policies. In this work, we explore a design that enables running unmodified Kubernetes workloads directly on HPC. With <a href=\"https://github.com/CARV-ICS-FORTH/HPK\">High-Performance Kubernetes (HPK)</a>, users deploy their own private Kubernetes “mini Clouds”, which internally convert container lifecycle management commands to use the system-level Slurm installation for scheduling and Singularity/Apptainer as the container runtime. We consider this approach to be practical for deployment in HPC centers, as it requires minimal pre-configuration and retains existing resource management and accounting policies. HPK provides users with an effective way to utilize resources by a combination of well-known tools, APIs, and more interactive and user-friendly interfaces as is common practice in the Cloud domain, as well as seamlessly combine Cloud-native tools with HPC jobs in converged, containerized workflows.</p>",

Despite the generated code in most cases being equivalent,\nI observe significant performance differences on the same hardware. I\ncan identify the root causes of most of these differences, many of\nwhich are due to relatively superficial details such as inconsistent\ndefaults regarding compiler optimisation and numerical accuracy,\nalthough a few remain mysterious.

Highlighting techniques implemented on modern GPU architectures, we discuss their applicability to scientific computing workloads, including LU factorization and beyond.

Through high performance computing, we have a cost effective pathway to future power solutions through a digital engineering approach. \nTherefore we need to develop connected multiphysics tools that can scale up to and beyond the exascale to truly be able to perform in silico analysis of prototype fusion power plant designs.</p>\n<p>This work presents a collection of open source multiphysics tools covering electromagnetics, neutronics, computational fluid dynamics, heat transfer and isotope transport. These tools can be coupled through \nthe MOOSE framework allowing the concurrent solution of all the physics of interest in a system. And thus can be used for the analysis of power plant systems at scale and enable the acceleration of making fusion power a reality.</p>\n<p>Fusion is not a problem that can be solved by a single group and so we leverage the benefits of open source in our digital engineering approach to enable global collaboration in addressing the challenge of climate change and future renewable energy sources.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>HPC clusters are characterized by powerful hardware and fine-tuned software environments to extract as much performance as possible from the system. Surprisingly, many HPC systems typically use the default kernel provided by its Linux distribution of choice, which is a generic binary built to maximize stability and compatibility and lacks the fine-tuning for performance characteristic of such systems.\nWe explored the impact of different optimization techniques that can be carried out on the Linux kernel without changing its code. We tested compiler optimizations with GCC and LLVM, using CPU instruction sets specific to the target hardware, profile guided optimizations (PGO) or link time optimizations (LTO). The result is that such optimizations on kernel space have limited effects and depend on the type of workload, rendering them difficult to apply on HPC systems with a diverse ecosystem.\nThe main goal is to generate (more) optimized kernel images with the same exact functionality of the distribution kernel used in your system. We specifically target kernels of RPM-based Linux distributions and show how to generate drop-in replacements with the aforementioned optimizations.</p>",

Starting with decimal data types, we will examine their suitability for financial and commercial applications where precision and exactness are paramount. Next, we will discuss fixed-point data types and their application in real-time systems and embedded devices where computational resources are limited. A significant portion of the presentation will be dedicated to floating-point data types, including the IEEE 754 standard and its evolution. We will investigate the trade-offs between range, precision, and performance, as well as the challenges of accurately representing real numbers in a finite digital format. </p>\n<p>Recent developments in floating-point formats, such as the IEEE 754-2019 standard, Google's Brain Float 16, NVIDIA's 19 bit TensorFloat 32, and the 18 flavors of 8 bit floating point, will also be covered. Additionally, we will explore the concept of shared exponent data types, including block float and posits which have gained popularity in recent years. We will analyze the potential benefits and drawbacks of these formats, including their impact on numerical computations and their suitability for specific applications. Throughout the presentation, we will draw on real-world examples, benchmarks, and use cases to illustrate the practical implications of choosing the right data type for a particular task. \nBy the end of this talk, it is the hope of the speaker that attendees will gain a deeper understanding of the history, trade-offs, and best practices for working with non integer data types, enabling them to make informed decisions in their own projects and applications.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>When we consider the grand challenges addressed by distributed systems, we likely imagine large-scale machines and parallel code. Yet, these two pillars of computing – hardware and software – are not enough to ensure high efficiency and reproducible performance. When unaware of the topology of the underlying hardware, even well-designed applications and software libraries can fail to achieve their scientific goals. Affinity – how software maps to and leverages local hardware resources – forms a third pillar critical to computing systems. </p>\n<p>Multiple factors motivate an understanding of affinity for HPC and Data Science users. On the software side, applications are increasingly memory-bandwidth limited making locality more important. On the hardware side, today’s computer architectures offer increasingly complex memory and compute topologies, making proper affinity policies crucial to effective software-hardware assignments.</p>\n<p>In this talk, I will present <a href=\"https://github.com/LLNL/mpibind\">mpibind</a>, a memory-driven library to map parallel hybrid applications to the underlying architecture transparently from the point of view of applications. This library provides a simple interface for computational scientists and results in a full mapping of MPI tasks, threads, and GPU kernels to hardware processing units and memory domains. Furthermore, scientists do not have to deal with intricate details of the hardware topology and thus increasing their productivity. Finally, mpibind is portable across computer architectures bridging the gap between performance and ease-of-use on parallel clusters.</p>",

By providing an intuitive user interface, <em>ClusterCockpit</em> simplifies performance analysis and enhances usability for diverse stakeholders. While analyzing job profiles can provide critical insights, manual analysis often requires significant time and expertise. To streamline this process, we developed <strong>Patho-Jobs</strong>, an automated tool that leverages data from <em>ClusterCockpit</em> to detect underperforming jobs or those requiring intervention.

    "abstract": "<p>From frontend developers to data scientists; from hobbyists to researchers, the JavaScript programming language offers something to everyone. Still, while everybody asks \"what is JavaScript?\" nobody asks \"how is JavaScript?\".</p>\n<p>It might therefore be interesting to dig a bit deeper into this complex and versatile programming language: Where is it going? How has it evolved over the years? How does language design and evolution happen in the first place? What are the rules put in place to ensure that it evolves in the right direction and continue to serve its ever-evolving set of users and other stakeholders?</p>\n<p>Join me in this overview of the TC39 standards committee, its processes and initiatives as we learn just how much work goes into reshaping the most popular programming language for the future.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>The landscape of AI training data stands at a critical crossroads. As large language models increasingly shape our digital ecosystem, the methods of data collection and curation have become a complex battleground of legal, ethical, and technical challenges.</p>\n<p>Concerns from creators have spurred lawsuits and prompted AI companies to limit transparency about training datasets, undermining accountability, innovation, and research. While using open access or public domain data could address these issues, at the time of writing, no large-scale competitive models trained on such data exist yet due to challenges like unreliable metadata, digitization costs, the “consent crisis,” and the need for legal and technical expertise.</p>\n<p>In this talk, we will discuss pioneering community efforts toward creating open and responsible AI training datasets that challenge the current opaque practices of major AI companies and chart a path toward open datasets as part of a larger public AI ecosystem that can address humanity's most pressing needs while distributing control among many stakeholders.</p>\n<p>In June 2024, Mozilla and EleutherAI convened 30 open dataset builders from across the field—organizations such as Hugging Face, Pleias, Cohere4AI, LLM360, TogetherAI, and many more—to address these critical issues. Based on the insights from this gathering, we co-created a research paper titled \"Towards Best Practices for Open Datasets for LLM Training\". This paper outlines the challenges of navigating the production of open datasets and provides practical recommendations for sourcing, processing, governing, and releasing such datasets. These recommendations are rooted in on-the-ground experience and paired with examples of what is already being done. While the paper references OSI's Open Source AI definition, it goes further by outlining possible tiers of openness and offering avenues for more ethical data governance in AI datasets. </p>\n<p>This session will provide an in-depth exploration of the current landscape and its main players, unpacking the legal ambiguities surrounding AI training data and highlighting the critical importance of transparency and governance. We will share a practical roadmap for developing datasets that promote healthy openness, respect people and communities’ broadly defined rights, and advance the field of artificial intelligence from a digital public good perspective, as well as an overview of concrete policy and tech investments that would unlock the ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Building a future where AI systems can be trained on openly licensed data that is responsibly curated and governed requires collaboration across legal, technical, and policy domains, and fostering a culture of openness. With this session, we hope to engage you in a discussion around the unique insights into this cutting-edge work and invite you to add your voice to the growing community of responsible open-source AI developers and advocates.</p>",

The ability to efficiently store high volumes of dimensional time series also makes Prometheus a perfect fit broader operational analytics use cases. Examples are observing fleets of IoT devices, connected vehicles, media streaming devices, and any distributed resources. However, the high cardinality and frequency of events generated by these sources be challenging. Apache Flink can preprocess observability events in real-time before writing to Prometheus. Reducing cardinality or frequency, adding contextual information, calculating derived metrics, will improve the efficiency of your observability platform. In this talk, an Apache Flink committer and the maintainer of the new open source Flink-Prometheus connector, will illustrate potential use cases, key challenges, and how to leverage Flink and Prometheus together to supercharge your observability platform.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Auto-instrumentation sounds like a free lunch - press buttons, get signals - but nothing is truly free. Auto-instrumentation requires resources just like any other process, and this requirement scales with the application it's automatically instrumenting.</p>\n<p>So what's the cost? Well, I can't tell you what it will be in your application, but over the last year or so we’ve been auto-instrumenting quite a lot of code. So let's explore some performance testing experiments to learn more about how much you're paying for that free lunch.</p>\n<p>Oh, and what are the benefits? Let me show you that too :)</p>",

We’ll show you how metadata can be transmitted and embedded in various parts of the TCP/IP packet to send context to the other side, outside of the application protocol.</p>\n<p>The second approach uses TCP/IP Level 7 protocol manipulation to embed the additional trace context information. We’ll show two different Level 7 protocol extension approaches we’ve implemented and describe some of their pros and cons.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>OpenTelemetry is often introduced as a way to send your metrics, traces, and logs to separate backend databases. But in reality, most organizations juggle at least half a dozen monitoring tools in production. What we really need isn’t just a standardized way to collect telemetry—it’s a unified datastore that brings all the backends together, much like how OpenTelemetry has unified telemetry collection.</p>\n<p>Could ClickHouse be that solution? In this talk, Joshua will dive into the fundamental nature of telemetry and explore what we truly need from a unified telemetry datastore. He’ll break down the specific features of ClickHouse that make it an exceptional choice for tracing and logs today—and hint at its growing potential for time-series data in the future.</p>\n<p>From there, he’ll highlight the seamless integrations between ClickHouse and open-source tools like OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, Grafana, and Kafka, showcasing how these technologies work together to enhance observability pipelines. Finally, we’ll take a closer look at cutting-edge, open-source observability platforms built on ClickHouse, including CoRoot, QRYN, and SigNoz.</p>\n<p>Whether you’re building a complete observability platform or exploring how to simplify your own observability strategy, this session will equip you with insights into leveraging ClickHouse as a core part of your telemetry infrastructure. Join us to learn how to move beyond fragmented tools and unlock the power of unified observability.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>KubeVirt, which provides additional functionality to Kubernetes clusters, to perform virtual machine management, is a large multi-component project that, like many others, grew rapidly with a strong focus on delivering new features. In the beginning, observability was not a priority. Whenever necessary, the developers of each component would add Prometheus instrumentation in their code bases in very different ways.</p>\n<p>As the project matured and observability became increasingly more important, we created a dedicated team. By then, there were high levels of intertwined observability and business logic code. It was challenging to keep a mental model of how different teams implemented observability across repositories and difficult to maintain them in sync with new features.</p>\n<p>This presentation will outline and demo how we modularized the code and made it more readable, and maintainable. By encapsulating the Prometheus monitoring best practices and the common patterns into a library with a strict interface and using it as a dependency for all KubeVirt components, we reduced code complexity, made it easy to maintain and evolve, and reduced the risk of introducing errors. Our experience will give you a clear path forward on how to clean up and improve observability code in your projects.</p>",

F1 is one the most complex engineering disciplines on the face of the Earth. What these people did in under 23min is nothing short of amazing.</li>\n<li><strong>Clear processes</strong>. Everyone new their place. Everyone knew exactly what they needed to do. Coordination was as close to perfection as it could be.</li>\n<li><strong>Clear communication</strong>. Clear messages between people (engineers, managers, etc). Zero confusion. Everyone focused on getting the job done.</li>\n<li><strong>The calmness on everyone's voice</strong>. No shouting. No need to emphasize urgency or pressure on requests. They know people will perform at their best if they're as calm as they possibly can.</li>\n<li><strong>Making quick decisions</strong>: The team had to rapidly decide whether to attempt a fix on the grid or forfeit Verstappen’s starting position.</li>\n<li><strong>Teamwork</strong>: The mechanics worked together efficiently to remove and replace damaged parts within a tight timeframe.</li>\n<li><strong>Postmortem:</strong> Formula 1 team debriefs are brutal but it’s the price to pay for excellence.</li>\n</ul>",

But, the same strengths in running applications on Kubernetes can be a huge hurdle when monitoring these same deployments.</p>\n<p>A single pod can easily expose 25 different metrics, and each container can add another 20 metrics. So, for a minimal single node K8s cluster, even running a minimum of 10 pods can let your metrics volume to 5000 data points. Now imagine, running a multi node cluster in a multi cluster fleet , what a chaos it can be! This brings up a huge challenge of understanding and handling metrics that are actually useful.\nIt doesn’t really end at just understanding your metrics - How do you set up alerting? How do you correlate this enormous data? How do you develop or adopt the right tooling? </p>\n<p>This talk delves into the art and science of building a robust observability ecosystem tailored for large-scale environments. We'll focus on the key three fundamentals for managing observability at scale without sacrificing performance - Metrics, Alerts and Correlation.</p>\n<p>Drawing from our daily experience managing a multi-cluster, complex fleet as SREs at Red Hat, we'll share our approach to effectively collecting and managing metrics, developing alerting strategies, and extracting valuable insights by properly correlating telemetry. These practices help establish a solid foundation for a strategic and robust cluster monitoring system.\nWhether you're starting from scratch or optimising your existing setup, these insights will help you build a resilient, scalable observability framework.

This enables our small team of Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) to rest assured while maintaining best-in-class uptime for our customers.</p>",

Building a cohesive strategy with widely available tooling shortens the time-to-productivity for new contributors to projects internal and open-source, demonstrating that the maintainers care about onboarding and the developer experience. I'll introduce how my team solved this problem using a nearly 50-year-old program and push the audience toward better developer experiences, starting at the greatest common denominator of tooling. Some newer tooling makes some of this easier, but corporate Python projects and open source projects alike benefit from this approach.</p>",

Or maybe you are someone who loves Open Source (possibly even contributed to some open source projects) but does not feel like you will ever be able to contribute a project of your own that might interest others. If you connect with one of these three descriptions, I have prepared this talk for you.

I will explain that Nim can be used as a fast and easy to use complement to Python with a great interoperability and metaprogramming superpowers. Nim has also a powerful type system, functional features and can compile to Javascript.</p>\n<p>In the second part I will tell you a bit about my story on how I got attracted to Nim coming from Python, the benefits of a niche community, and how I came out with a deeper appreciation for the Python project and community.</p>\n<p>In the third part, I will show you how easy it is to create your own open source project with Nim and share it with the world (maybe even a Python version of it), and I will tell you a little bit about my own open source project, called Nimib, a literate programming tool for interactive explanations.</p>\n<p>The talk is kept approachable for beginners while trying to be interesting also for experts.

By combining Django, HTMX, and web components, we can create fast, interactive sites without unnecessary complexity.</p>\n<p>To showcase how these advantages come together in practice, we’ll explore a small example. Introducing <a href=\"https://github.com/ephes/django-resume/\">django-resume</a>, a lightweight third-party Django app that adds a resume and CV section to your site—with no dependencies besides Django itself. It demonstrates:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Achieving SPA-like behavior using HTMX with server-side rendering.</li>\n<li>Storing all data in a single JSONField to simplify database interactions and data export.</li>\n<li>Enabling inline editing with contenteditable elements and web components.</li>\n<li>Adding features through plugins without database migrations.</li>\n<li>Using JSON data with Large Language Models (LLMs) for content creation.</li>\n</ul>",

It's been known for a while that those are not reproducible: on different architectures, the bytecode for exactly the same sources ends up slightly different. Fedora is working on making all package builds reproducible, and with 8500 Python source packages, we quickly found out that differences in bytecode give us grief. One source of the difference (reference flag numbering) has been known for a while. But after cleaning that up, we found that there are at least two other ways in which bytecode is irreproducible: one related to reference use (also solved), one related to object order (still unsolved). In this talk we'll describe the problem and report how Fedora rewrites bytecode files in package builds to make them smaller and reproducible.</p>",

Even the previous real-time-related enhancements brought so many valuable fixes and features for kernel deployment outside the RT area that Linus Torvalds recognized the community around RT deployment of GNU/Linux as valuable and worthy of gradually incorporating its work over the years.  The first meeting of the community interested in using GNU/Linux in RT applications took place in Vienna exactly 25 years ago (<a href=\"https://www.osadl.org/RTLWS-1999.rtlws-1999.0.html\">Real Time Linux Workshop</a>). Another round anniversary is 20 years since kernel list debate following by possible solutions for real-time Linux deployment debate at the Real Time Linux Workshop <a href=\"https://www.osadl.org/RTLWS-2006.rtlws-2006.0.html\">conference</a> at Lanzhou University in China. The first minor modifications (<a href=\"https://lwn.net/Articles/185666/\">runtime locking correctness validator</a>) were included in the main development tree by that time as well as <a href=\"https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/locking/rt-mutex-design.html\">mutex priority inheritance</a>, the fundamental requirement for each RTOS. To date, about 10,000 changes have been submitted to the main kernel tree directly by the RT development team and 5,000 changes in the related drivers and subsystems added by their maintainers in response to patch requests and other needs.</p>\n<p>In this talk, I will present the development history, highlight and gaps learned, testing for automotive communication etc. because I have followed the development from the beginning to allow our applications and projects realization.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>The Linux kernel is a foundational element of the modern IT infrastructure, powering billions of devices from smartphones and routers to desktops and supercomputers. Consequently, the quality of its code affects IT's reliability, resilience, performance, and evolution. Through this presentation I aim to improve our understanding of the Linux kernel's code quality regarding its usage of the C preprocessor: a dated, ubiquitous, and often insidious part of the compilation process. I show the characteristics of the C preprocessor's usage, the introduced technical debt, the usage's evolution, and the feasibility of reducing the incurred technical debt, mainly through refactoring and by utilizing facilities of the Rust programming language.</p>\n<p>As a tool for the analysis I extended the <a href=\"https://www.spinellis.gr/cscout/\">CScout</a> refactoring browser to collect tens of metrics before and after the C preprocessor's execution. I then applied CScout on three versions of Linux spanning two decades, running the oldest kernel analysis on the <a href=\"https://www.qemu.org/\">QEMU emulator</a>  and the newest on the <a href=\"https://doc.aris.grnet.gr/system/hardware/\">ARIS supercomputer</a>, processing in total more than 45 million lines of code.</p>\n<p>I found that the C preprocessor is extensively used, often doubling key code elements seen by the C compiler-proper. The preprocessor's use is associated with several types of technical debt including namespace pollution; scoping, namespace, and control-flow confusion; composite identifiers; hybrid call paths; deep and cyclic include hierarchies; expansion explosions; and structural quality metrics deterioration. Although the density of some preprocessor usages is steady or decreasing over time, some worrisome usages are showing significant increases.</p>\n<p>To explore how this situation can be addressed, I present a taxonomy of non-trivial C preprocessor use cases, which indicates that there two broad categories of changes that can be made. First, most object-like macros can be easily refactored into C <code>const</code> objects or <code>enum</code> values, while about half of the function-like macros could be rewritten as C functions. Although this change is wide in scope the corresponding gains in code maintainability will be small. Second, the remaining non-trivial C preprocessor function-like macros could be refactored; many through specific facilities of Rust that I describe for corresponding macro use cases. In this case however the amount of required engineering effort is large.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>The Linux kernel architecture faces inherent limitations in its security design, primarily due to constraints imposed by the underlying hardware. The Linux kernel must not only isolate user-space processes but also protect itself from unauthorized access—a task made increasingly challenging by the presence of vulnerabilities. Since modern security mechanisms rely on the Linux kernel's integrity, their effectiveness collapses as soon as the kernel is compromised. Therefore, the kernel's resilience is crucial to the security of the entire system, raising the fundamental question: how can we maintain robust security despite the presence of kernel vulnerabilities?</p>\n<p>In this presentation, we introduce a virtualization-assisted security architecture for the Linux kernel to address these challenges. Our solution provides a lightweight virtualization layer comprising a thin, formally-verifiable virtual machine monitor on top of the open-source NOVA microhypervisor. Acting as a security support layer, this architecture enables the Linux kernel to effectively leverage the system's virtualization extensions to fortify its defenses. In-line with virtualization-based state-of-the-art security mechanisms, our solution enforces Linux kernel code integrity and protects selected data structures from being abused by malicious actors. Beyond these capabilities, it enables advanced security features, such as isolating selected security-critical subsystems within the Linux kernel itself and providing a versatile event monitoring facility targeting the activity of applications and containers in user space. Overall, by bridging the traditional separation between the OS and system virtualization technologies, our open source implementation integrates both to create a more robust and resilient security foundation. We present our implementation as a promising approach to mitigating the risks posed by kernel vulnerabilities while significantly enhancing the security posture of modern systems.</p>",

Each of these methods has unique application domains, strengths, and limitations in terms of complexity and usability, while sharing core capabilities. Although primarily used for building powerful debugging tools (e.g., gdb, strace), these mechanisms can also be leveraged to construct syscall-based virtual machines, achieving varied performance levels and encountering specific challenges.</p>\n<p>A distinctive feature of syscall-based virtual machines is their ability to selectively emulate system calls. For example, one might choose to emulate open(2) but not socket(2), thereby providing the guest environment with a tailored \"view\" of the underlying operating system.</p>\n<p>This seminar will explore the current state of syscall tracing and virtualization techniques through practical demonstrations, examine their inherent limitations, and propose potential improvements to enhance usability and performance.

You'll need your own laptop (no installs needed, Hedy is webbased) and reading- and basic typing skills (or someone to help you read and type). No prior programming experience is needed.

    "abstract": "<p>Education typically prepares young people for professional life, equipping them with the skills to meet industry demands. Occasionally, however, the flow is reversed - educational research reshapes the industry itself. Historically, work on educational programming languages has sparked innovations like personal computing, graphical user interfaces, and the object-oriented programming paradigm.</p>\n<p>In recent years, visual programming languages - where scripts are built by snapping together graphical blocks - have become a powerful tool for introducing programming to novices. But could there be more to these blocks than just their use in education? Could they point to a broader, transformative approach to programming itself?</p>\n<p>In this talk, I’ll explore the <em><a href=\"https://snap.berkeley.edu\">Snap!</a></em> visual programming language and showcase its recent developments, where blocks become <em>first-class citizens</em> of the language. By treating blocks as a computational domain, Snap! demonstrates how blocks can surpass their textual counterparts in expressiveness and versatility. This shift may offer new ways to form mental models of computation, potentially laying the groundwork for a new programming paradigm.</p>\n<p>Join me as we examine the exciting possibilities of a block-oriented approach to programming and consider whether this marks the beginning of something much bigger.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Open-source software makes it possible to create embroidery designs and stitch them onto clothing, bags, and patches. Learn how to create beautiful designs that can be stitched onto fabric using an embroidery machine.  There are two approaches, one is via programmatic embroidery (TurtleStitch), the other is using design software (Ink/Stitch, based on Inkscape).  The different approaches taken by both software packages will be discussed, and how the resulting output is stitched on an embroidery machine will be demonstrated.</p>\n<p>www.turtlestitch.org\nwww.inkstitch.org\n@megjlow@fosstodon.org</p>",

    "url": "https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-4076-foll-e-open-source-educational-tool-to-stimulate-logical-reasoning/",
    "abstract": "<p>FOLL-E is an interactive tool designed to stimulate and sharpen the logical reasoning skills of children ages 8-12. Inspired by languages such as Scratch and Blockly, we have developed a blocks-based interface for pure logic. Crucially, we have proceeded to turn our blocks physical: children are given tangible \"puzzle pieces\" instead of a keyboard and mouse. This physical nature makes the tool more inviting and fun to play with, yet can still express everything we want.</p>\n<p>The setup consists of a camera attached to a Raspberry Pi, which is connected to a computer screen. On the computer screen, children are presented with two groups of three robots each. A logic rule separates both robot groups (e.g., in one, all robots have a green arm, compared to none in the other). The goal is for the children to figure out this rule, and compose it by assembling the \"puzzle pieces\" into the correct configuration representing this rule. The Raspberry Pi then detects the blocks and verifies their correctness using an open-source logic engine. If correct, it continues on to the next level. If incorrect, it explains to the children where they went wrong, so that they can try again. In this sense, FOLL-E is meant to be very interactive.</p>\n<p>From the get-go, we wanted FOLL-E to be freely available to everyone. As such, all aspects of FOLL-E are open source and available online for free, including among others the code and the design plans for the blocks. Furthermore, we are working on a detailed step-by-step building guide, aimed at e.g. schools. In a sense, anyone with access to a laser cutter and a Raspberry Pi can make their own setups -- which we strongly encourage you to do. :-)</p>\n<p>Feel free to check out https://FOLL-E.com for pictures/videos of FOLL-E or https://gitlab.com/Vadevesi/foll-e to take a look at the source code.</p>",

The time to replace surveillance capitalist based Ed-tech by ethical open source alternatives is now.</p>\n<p>We would like to build a European movement to create a free, sovereign alternative to the proprietary clouds offered by Big Tech that many kids are now forced to use.  We know that there are many beautiful initiatives in several places, but mostly independent of each other. We would like to reach out to our international colleagues, join forces together and help each other to make serious impact.</p>\n<p>With this group, we would like to:</p>\n<pre><code>Build and improve educational tools\nIntegrate existing FOSS tools to create a complete suite for schools\nDevelop deployment methods\nTake legal action\nLobby at the EU\n</code></pre>\n<p>In this presentation, we want to share our strategy and what we have been working on in the Netherlands to get attention for public values in educational software and show FOSS alternatives.</p>",

However, if we go deeper into the way videogames are made, we’ll learn that their market can be brutal and the ethics of their business models highly debatable – if not plain intolerable. Nowadays, playing a videogame usually means having to renounce your privacy and shake hands with realities that we might not condone if we knew what they conceal. Free software allows us to reject this premise and grants people access to these experiences and the means to create games in ways that do no harm. Join us and discover Luanti, the voxel libre game platform that is widely used for both entertainment and education without ever compromising on the premise of total respect for all human beings.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Based on our previous work on the now deprecated Beetle Blocks Snap! fork, we now present a new extension for Snap! that lets users generate 3D geometry programmatically. By giving instructions to a beetle, users can create surfaces and volumes based on simpler lower-dimensional objects. These 3D shapes can then be exported and printed on a 3D printer, or further manipulated in 3D modelling software.</p>\n<p>The fact that these volumes are generated programmatically makes this extension an ideal tool to explore algorithmic and fractal structures, but we have also found it rather convenient to generate more mundane and functional geometry, such as toy replacements or simple home improvement parts.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Vocational Education is often not considered when it comes to open source as it neither happens in Schools or in Universities. Yet today over 300,000 IT specialists alone have completed their vocational education in Germany. In this talk, we will explore the reasons for integrating open source into vocational programs and delve into the specific content of vocational education for IT specialists and the options to add education about open source in the curriculum. I will also share practical examples of our own efforts to incorporate open source learning, providing insights into what works – and what doesn't!</p>",

MIT App Inventor is an intuitive, visual programming environment that allows everyone – even children – to build fully functional apps for Android and iOS devices. Those new to MIT App Inventor can have a simple first app up and running in less than 30 minutes. Our blocks-based tool also facilitates the creation of complex, high-impact apps in significantly less time than traditional programming environments. We will briefly discuss the platform and its design philosophy, build a simple app, and show how to build an extension for Android apps.</p>",
