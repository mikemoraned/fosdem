    "abstract": "<p>We need to talk about war. And we need to talk about companies building bots that propose to rewrite our source code. And about the people behind both, and how we preserve what is great about FOSS while avoiding disruption. How do geopolitical conflicts on the one hand and the risk of bot-generated (adversarial) code on the other influence the global community working together on Free and Open Source software?</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The immense corpus of free and open source software created by a global community of researchers and engineers, developers, architects and designers is an impressive achievement of human collaboration at an unprecedented scale. An even bigger circle of users, translators, writers, creatives, civil society advocates, public servants and private sector stakeholders has helped to further develop and spread this technological Gesammtkunstwerk far and wide - with the help of the internet and the web. With individual freedoms and user empowerment at its center, these jointly created digital public goods have removed many economic and societal barriers for a large part of the world's population. Users are not just allowed to benefit from technology, but each and every user can in principle actively help shape it. On top of the FOSS ecosystem our global economy has been propelled to unprecedented levels.</p>\n<p>Much of this incredible growth was achieved within a (relatively) calm geopolitical situation, in the wake of the cold war which ended in the very same year that also saw the genesis of the World Wide Web at CERN in Switzerland. Economists, philosophers and other observers at the time spoke of the 'end of history' and expected no more big conflicts at the superpower level. We could now globalise the economy and all work together. The flood of innovation taking place all around us promised a bright future for all, with room for altruism and collaboration. In retrospect it certainly was an ideal situation for an optimistic and constructive global movement like the FOSS community to take over the helm.</p>\n<p>But apart from the fact that under the surface that narrative was already flawed (with some actors like the USA having a double agenda, as the Snowden and Shadowbrokers revelations exposed) history didn't end. To some ironic extent we are now becoming victim of our own success. In recent years we've seen geopolitical stability punctured by war effort levering low cost technology that includes heaps of FOSS. Social media powered by FOSS infrastructure promote disinformation and have successfully stirred large scale polarisation. Within some of the largest and most populous countries on the planet authoritarian regimes have successfully used technology to break oppression in a new race towards totalitarianism. While for instance Europe has tried to regulate 'dual use' technology, \"any use\" technology (which our libre licenses guarantee) has escaped our attention. Even in countries which had stable non-authoritarian regimes there is a visible technology-assisted relapse towards anti-democratic movements. On the back of a tech stack which consists of FOSS with a thin crust of proprietary special sauce, unprecedented private capital (sometimes referred to as 'hypercapitalism') is interfering with global politics at an alarming rate. Apart from the direct democratic disbalance the resulting oligarchy is giving rise to overt nepotism, corruption and a new global protectorate for predatory business models and unethical extractive behaviour. Expecting peace in cyberspace any time soon is probably naive, and free and open source technology stands to make up for a significant part of the battleground.</p>\n<p>At the same time we are facing other challenges, such as climate change and an imminent scarcity of non-renewable resources. We have more people living on the surface of the planet than ever before, and they are consuming more raw materials and more energy than ever. This won't go on indefinitely. And right at that point we see an army of next generation Trojan horses galloping through the gates of our global commons villages, accelerating our use of both. Generative pre-trained transformers (also known as Large Language Models) kindly offer to take cumbersome and boring coding work off our hands. They can liberate us from responsibility and allow us to do other things or move even faster.</p>\n<p>But is it really wise to accept this apparent gift, or should we be a little more suspicious? Just as it has proven way too easy for AI to poison the web with fake content, our software supply chain is vulnerable to manipulation. The attack surface is immense. Due to the inherent complexity of software it is easier to achieve and harder to detect manipulation before it is too late. While many talented and committed people have spent years reverse engineering binary blobs to avoid the associated risks, those blobs were at least isolated and clearly marked. AI is the ultimate black box and it introduces significantly more uncertainty: it rewrites the truth from the inside.</p>\n<p>AI in its current form has no actual sense of truth or ethics. Like with Russian roulette, once in a while the models completely bork up and create phantom code and real risk - and that is even in a best case scenario, without assuming malicious intent and manipulation from the outside. In an adversarial scenario (and this adversity can come from traditional nation state actors with non-aligned interests but also from corporate or even private individuals with some determination - like Cambridge Analytica illustrated so vividly) manipulation only requires subtle changes. At the frantic scale at which any available learning content is ingested from the internet these days one can expect targeted adversarial training to manipulate specific code with subtle triggers to go unnoticed.</p>\n<p>As a community we have spent billions of hours of careful coding and software engineering to make free and open source technology as trustworthy as it is today. Geopolitical conflict is an incentive to hollow out that trust. AI is an additional leap of faith, and if you look at the forces driving its adoption and their interests, are we really sure those black boxes are safe to invite into our trusted coding base? It is clear that the end game of AI coding is not a healthy FOSS ecosystem, but its total displacement. The threat of machine crafted and man-crafted malicious code in war-time FOSS are equally realistic. Perhaps we can find a middle ground, where we combine some of AI and human skill - and add enough checks and balances, and a variety of assurances through compartementalisatoin, formal and symbolical proofs and other traditional means of quality assurance.</p>\n<p>This talk is an open exploration of some of the challenges the FOSS community will have in the years ahead, working towards a hopeful notion of maximal defendable FOSS.</p>",

It still has many warts: user experience, arbitrary limitations, performance issues and no good support for large binary files are just some of the issues that users commonly complain about.</p>\n<p>In this talk you'll learn what is happening in the Git project to address these issues.

    "abstract": "<p>Git is a tool most programmers rely on, whether for work or personal projects. It’s far more than just a method for syncing local and remote changes. Git embodies a way of thinking that serves as the foundation for development workflows and steers project evolution.</p>\n<p>At its core, Git has essential concepts such as commits, change history, branching, rebasing, and merging. While Git offers many features, these are its heart. Misusing them can lead to significant opportunity costs, while striking the right balance simplifies development at all levels and benefits the project’s community (if it has any).</p>\n<p>In this talk I am sharing my own experience how applying these core concepts in real projects significantly accelerates development, especially in mission-critical systems. I’ll cover specifically the following topics with true examples from my work places, both open and closed source:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The importance of commit “atomicity” and what it means.</li>\n<li>The cost and value of maintaining a clean commit history.</li>\n<li>How “multi-commit patchsets” can accelerate development and code review.</li>\n<li>Using rebase as a method for constructing patchsets.</li>\n<li>Merge-Commits vs Fast-Forward.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All of that combined into a framework that I call \"Atomic Flow\".</p>\n<p>Many teams enforce strict Git practices based on these key principles, and for good reason. I’ve worked on projects that fully harnessed Git’s potential from the outset, as well as those that initially overlooked its strengths but later embraced them. My goal is to help more teams achieve greater efficiency by adopting these best practices, provided their project highly depends on uncompromising code quality and easy maintenance. This is what \"Atomic Flow\" is about.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>I stumbled upon a forum post of Jean, tasked in 2010 with recovering text documents for a friend from their broken Windows 95 computer. Their friend used Microsoft Bob, and the Microsoft Bob letter writer exclusively.</p>\n<p>I was fascinated by this story, and then spent months reverse-engineering the Microsoft Bob APIs. Ultimately producing the first third-party Microsoft Bob application. During this I learned that Microsoft Bob isn't only a laughable flop, (The word \"only\" is doing a lot of work here), it also had strong ideas on what computing should be.</p>\n<p>We will take a tour of Bob and its history and what I discovered about its technical underpinnings while reverse engineering. </p>\n<p>Hopefully I can convince you that these stories are still relevant today, and can inform us on how we think about the software we use. But most importantly; the software we recommend our (non-techy) friends and family to use.</p>\n<p>Introducing Hard-working, Easy going Software Everyone Will Use</p>",

Remarkably, raylib is still actively developed and maintained by a single person: its original author.</p>\n<p>In this talk, we will explore this 12-year adventure directly from its creator. We will look at how the library has evolved, how a tools ecosystem and community has been formed around it, what challenges and decisions shaped raylib direction and how the project has influenced the creator’s life. This is the story of a passionate open-source adventure.</p>",

While Linux rules the cloud, servers, and mobile devices, the desktop is where control, compliance, and independence become tangible. This talk explores the current state of Linux on the desktop in Europe, with a focus on two real-world case studies from a leading automotive company and the German government. We’ll examine success stories, roadblocks, and new approaches like immutable Linux, zero-trust models, and EU-level OS initiatives. If we ignore the desktop, we risk leaving the front door of digital sovereignty wide open – or we can start where it matters most: every desk, every user, every day.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Libreboot is a coreboot distribution — just as Debian is a Linux distribution — providing fully free (libre) boot firmware for x86 and ARM systems. It replaces proprietary BIOS/UEFI firmware, initializing hardware and starting your operating system. Linux and BSD operating systems are well supported.</p>\n<p>Coreboot provides essential hardware initialization and then jumps to a payload program that boots your OS. Libreboot provides several payloads including, but not limited to, U-Boot, SeaBIOS and GRUB. Firmware images are provided pre-compiled, for ease of installation.</p>\n<p>Libreboot began in 2013 and, as of September 2025, is an official Associated Project of Software in the Public Interest (SPI), joining long-established Free Software initiatives such as Debian. This talk will be presented by Leah Rowe, Libreboot’s founder and lead developer.</p>\n<p>Firmware freedom is more critical than ever as we increasingly depend on computing, for participation in every aspect of civil society. Proprietary firmware endangers privacy, ownership, and repairability. Libreboot ensures that users truly control their hardware — protecting both user freedom and hardware longevity — while promoting a sustainable culture of hardware reuse.</p>\n<p>Libreboot provides faster boot speeds, better security, and greater flexibility than typical proprietary firmware. Libreboot continues to provide updates — including security updates — long after vendors have dropped official support. The project’s philosophy is simple: you should keep using your hardware until you decide otherwise. Planned obsolescence is only a lack of imagination. Unlike the vendors, we will not try to control the users; our goal is to set you free!</p>\n<p>This talk will trace Libreboot’s long-term development history, its current progress, and its future roadmap. This talk will also include a live demonstration showing how easy and affordable it is for non-technical users to build and install Libreboot via automation. Libreboot makes free firmware accessible, practical, and even fun, empowering even non-technical users to take back control.</p>\n<p>At the time of this talk, Libreboot 25.12 (December 2025) also includes a Tianocore UEFI payload and extensive new hardware support — including hundreds of Chromebooks, several Intel Alder Lake platforms, and numerous Kaby Lake and Skylake ThinkPads. These additions, the result of sustained work throughout 2024 and 2025, mark a major expansion of Libreboot’s scope and capability.</p>\n<p>Libreboot’s main code repositories are hosted at: <a href=\"https://codeberg.org/libreboot\">https://codeberg.org/libreboot</a></p>\n<p>Libreboot’s SPI association provides fiscal sponsorship, ensuring transparent management and legal protection for the project. Libreboot also receives corporate support from Minifree Ltd, operated by Leah Rowe, which provides computers pre-installed with Libreboot firmware.</p>\n<p>Libreboot is a community project and we welcome every new contributor. Join us on Libera IRC (<code>#libreboot</code>) or via our SourceHut mailing list to participate.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>The integration of Open Source Software (OSS) in functionally safe systems represents a critical intersection of innovation and compliance requirements across multiple industries. This talk examines two complementary aspects of this evolving landscape: the current state of OSS in functional safety applications and the persistent barriers hindering wider adoption.</p>\n<p>2024/2025 have marked significant acceleration in the visibility and adoption of OSS in safety-critical environments, with diverse projects demonstrating varying levels of maturity. Foundation-backed initiatives like the ELISA project within the Linux Foundation are establishing frameworks for Linux in safety applications, while specialized operating systems such as Zephyr and Xen continue to gain traction. The Eclipse Foundation's Safe Open Vehicle Core (S-Core) project represents another significant advancement, aiming to create a common certifiable automotive middleware stack that addresses critical safety requirements. The ecosystem now spans from microkernel solutions like L4Re and seL4 to full-featured platforms, with Linux serving as a prime example of the opportunities and challenges in this space. Infrastructure improvements like the SPDX safety profile address critical aspects of safety documentation in Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs), while safety-certified components like the Ferrocene Rust compiler create new possibilities for language-level safety guarantees.</p>\n<p>Despite this progress, substantial barriers impede broader OSS adoption in functionally safe systems. A particularly persistent challenge remains the confusion around terminology and approaches - exemplified by the distinctions between \"safety Linux\" versus \"safe Linux\" that illustrate broader issues in how safety responsibility is allocated between OSS components and system-level mitigations. By examining architectural concepts currently implemented in production systems or under development, this talk cuts through marketing rhetoric to provide clear distinctions between approaches across various open source technologies.</p>\n<p>The author will address uncertainty around certification pathways, challenges in establishing sufficient evidence for safety arguments, fragmented governance models, and incomplete understanding of OSS development processes among safety assessors.</p>\n<p>Attendees will gain practical insights for evaluating safety approaches in OSS-based systems, including key questions to ask when assessing different safety concepts across industries, with particular emphasis on applications where both manufacturers and suppliers are seeking to implement open source software in safety-critical production systems.</p>\n<p>Links to relevant example projects as part of the talk are available in the resources.</p>",

This fragmentation prevents multi-lingual projects expressing precise dependencies across language ecosystems, means external system and hardware dependencies are implicit and unversioned, and obscures security vulnerabilities that lie in the full dependency graph. We present the Package Calculus, a formalism for dependency resolution that unifies the core semantics of diverse package managers. Through a series of formal reductions, we show how real-world package manager features reduce to our core calculus. We define the language Pac to translate between distinct package managers and show we can perform dependency resolution across ecosystems.</p>",

    "url": "https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/EP8AMW-oss-rebuild-observability/",
    "abstract": "<p>While reproducible builds provide a gold standard for artifact integrity, they often treat the build process itself as a black box: either it matches or it doesn't. But in an era of sophisticated supply chain attacks like the XZ backdoor and Shai Hulud, understanding why a build behaves the way it does is just as critical as the final output. To secure the open-source package ecosystem, we needed to look inside this black box. In this talk, we explore how OSS Rebuild instruments the build environment to detect \"badness\" in real-time. We detail our open-source observability suite, featuring a transparent network proxy for uncovering hidden remote dependencies and an eBPF-based system analyzer for examining build behavior in fine detail.</p>",

We'll share how PURLs enable accurate package tracking across ecosystems for vulnerability management (PURL is now part of CVE format), tool interoperability (already adopted by security tools, SCA platforms, and package registries), and compliance and security workflows (generating accurate and actionable SBOMs and VEXs).</p>\n<p>Whether you maintain a package manager, build supply chain security tools, query packages or vulnerability databases, or just want better visibility into your polyglot dependencies, you'll learn how this lightweight standard is the essential infrastructure for modern software ecosystems.</p>",

The story is different for binary dependencies: <em>numpy</em> depends on <em>OpenBLAS</em>'s binaries, but package managers can't easily see this. We must map the OSS ecosystem's binary dependency relationships to reliably (1) identify upstream security vulnerabilities and (2) properly credit and financially support maintainers. I propose solving this problem by creating a global index of binary dependencies, using a <em>global linker</em> that tracks binaries' symbols across the entire Open Source ecosystem, combined with auxiliary strategies like statically analysing build recipes.

Secondly In addition to these ports, the upstreaming first approach with Wine allowed us to quickly update the Wine version available after a release.\nThis talk will shed a light on the available compatibility tools  and how we can leverage these tools to improve the gaming experience on FreeBSD.</p>\n<p>Links to the mentioned project:\nhttps://docs.freebsd.org/en/articles/linux-emulation/\nhttps://www.winehq.org/\nhttps://github.com/shkhln/linuxulator-steam-utils\nhttps://github.com/ValveSoftware/wine\nhttps://github.com/shkhln/libc6-shim</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>It is no secret that certain applications, such as firewalls, routers, and hardened web services, perform best on BSD systems. Yet Linux dominates cloud infrastructure, forcing users to either port these applications or run them as full BSD virtual machines, each requiring special handling and management. This talk presents <code>urunc</code>, a container runtime for unikernels and single-application kernels that enables BSD workloads to run efficiently in Linux environments. <code>urunc</code> executes BSD applications in tiny microVMs and software-based sandboxes while integrating them seamlessly with existing Linux container platforms. This allows Kubernetes and similar systems  to manage BSD workloads alongside Linux containers without extra effort or special handling. A live demo will walk through building, packaging, and deploying BSD applications with urunc, with initial performance metrics on startup time and network throughput, showing that BSD applications remain practical even in BSD-“hostile” environments.</p>",

It is written for a cross-project kernel and file system hacker audience, a rare opportunity provided by this FOSDEM devroom.  The presentation begins with a high-level problem space overview, before diving down to user space, VFS and device levels to discuss the options as I see them.  It includes some exploratory patches developed over the past few years of working full time on PostgreSQL I/O, porting and testing on ~10 operating systems, and hacking on FreeBSD for fun and education.</p>\n<p>It is a 25 minute talk, broken up into 5 subtopics consisting of 5 one-minute slides, and the pace will be fast:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What databases want and why, a 30,000 foot overview </li>\n<li>User space programming interfaces for asynchronous I/O</li>\n<li>Kernel interfaces for asynchronous I/O</li>\n<li>PostgreSQL on FreeBSD/ZFS</li>\n<li>Using FreeBSD/UFS as a starting point for database/kernel interface exploration</li>\n</ul>",

    "abstract": "<p>We live in a age where internet is a requirement for our every day routines, whether it is to work from home, keep in contact with our family or our own leisure. It is a common to hear about how some company we trusted with our data has been hacked, and all our data is now floating around the internet. Many of us take steps to increase the security of our laptops, and our mobile phones. Some of us reject the use of SAAS services (such as Google Drive, Dropbox, Discord etc) and host our own, either on our own hardware or hardware rented in the cloud.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, this often leads us to assume that our local network is secure, thinking only about the security of our services and not the connectivity to them. Many routers issued to consumers by an ISP or bought often miss security patches (YMMV) and often reach EOL within a very short lifespan. It is also not uncommon for these routers to have their own custom configuration format, which is device specific, making migration to new hardware more difficult.</p>\n<p>Introducing OpenBSD, \"free, functional and secure\"! Any old hardware could become a router, that Raspberry Pi you have lying around? That old desktop you do not use anymore? OpenBSD comes with all the software you need for a router (and more!) within the base system.</p>\n<p>Join me, and lets discuss how to keep your network secure, and give you more control over your network.</p>",

It gives users control, but it also isolates them, with each server becoming a separate island.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cloudillo.org/\">Cloudillo</a> changes this. It is a self-hosted application platform that makes collaboration extensible, privacy-preserving, and organic — letting groups and organizations collaborate freely across different installations without relying on any centralizing infrastructure,\nwhile keeping their data private and under their control.</p>\n<p>At its core, Cloudillo provides all the building blocks of a modern collaboration suite: file storage, real-time database, live editing, social interactions, and user identity.</p>\n<p>But what’s the kicker with Cloudillo? It is that these are not closed features, but open APIs developers can use to build new applications that integrate seamlessly into the platform. A built-in DNS + PKI-based identity layer enables people and organizations to connect securely, exchange data, and seamlessly\nshare both content and applications across independently hosted Cloudillo instances — without any third-party coordination service.</p>\n<p>Cloudillo’s entire backend is delivered as a single 30MB Rust binary, with no external dependencies. It emphasizes simplicity, performance, and security. Developers can deploy it in minutes, extend it in Rust, or build applications in TypeScript, then immediately gain access to a global framework for\ndistributed collaboration.</p>\n<p>This short talk introduces the concept behind Cloudillo, explains its technical foundations, and demonstrates how developers can create their own apps — apps that reach beyond a single server, thanks to Cloudillo — the platform that aims to make privacy-first collaboration not just possible, but convenient and open for innovation.</p>",

    "slug": "GTZSA8-docspec",
    "url": "https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/GTZSA8-docspec/",
    "abstract": "<p>This talk is presented by Stephan Meijer (NL government, NLdoc/La Suite Docs) and Albert Krewinkel, maintainer of <a href=\"https://github.com/jgm/pandoc\">Pandoc</a>.</p>\n<p>Public administrations hold millions of documents trapped in formats that are hard to reuse and often fail WCAG requirements: PDFs, legacy Word templates, ad-hoc styles. At Logius, with the NLdoc project, we were tasked with turning those documents into accessible, reusable HTML and other open formats. Our first instinct was the obvious one: use Pandoc and wrap it with some pre- and post-processing. It worked… until it didn’t. Every new edge case, every new target editor, every new accessibility rule meant more custom glue code and brittle filters.</p>\n<p>So we flipped the problem: instead of chaining converters, we designed a JSON-based document Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) with an OpenAPI specification and built dedicated conversion services around it. That AST now sits at the centre of a small ecosystem: PDFs and DOCX files are converted into the AST, and from there into editors such as Tiptap and BlockNote, or directly into formats such as HTML. Support for ODT, Markdown and EPUB is on the way.</p>\n<p>The same AST also powers the NLdoc Tiptap-based editor, where authors get real-time accessibility validation and can export to accessible formats. It also powers the import functionality in La Suite (Docs), the FR–DE–NL sovereign collaboration stack.</p>\n<p>In this talk we’ll walk through that journey: why \"just use Pandoc\" wasn’t enough, what our AST looks like, how we wired it into a queue-based microservice architecture, and how this approach turns document conversion from a one-off migration hack into an interoperability layer for accessible, sovereign collaboration tools.</p>\n<p>Recent versions of the document specification are available at <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/logius/nldoc/spec/document/-/releases\">the Releases page of its repository</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Several converters are available in <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/logius/nldoc\">the NLdoc GitLab group</a>.</li>\n<li>The import API for La Suite Docs is published at <a href=\"https://github.com/docspecio/api\">github.com/docspecio/api</a>.</li>\n<li>The La Suite Docs application itself is available at <a href=\"https://github.com/suitenumerique/docs\">github.com/suitenumerique/docs</a>.</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"https://pandoc.org/\">Pandoc website (pandoc.org)</a>.</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"https://github.com/jgm/pandoc\">Pandoc repository (github.com/jgm/pandoc)</a>.</li>\n</ul>",

    "abstract": "<p>Four years ago, the We4Authors initiative united several content management tools (mostly open source) to identify and document accessibility best practices in preparation for the European Accessibility Act. It was the most coordinated effort to help content authors produce accessible digital content at scale. Yet, despite the groundwork, only the recommendations have not been widely adopted. The Web Almanac confirms what many suspected: web accessibility has not meaningfully improved in preparation for the Act’s introduction. https://events.drupal.org/europe2020/sessions/top-cms-tools-are-working-together-build-more-inclusive-world.html</p>\n<p>Much of this was built on or extending ideas in Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) 2.0. https://www.w3.org/TR/ATAG20/</p>\n<p>Today, the context has changed.</p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence—especially small, local language models—offers a new opportunity to deliver accessibility guidance where it’s needed most: at the moment of authoring. CMSs can leverage open source AI to suggest accessible alternatives, improve media descriptions, and identify structural issues in real time—without sending user data to third parties or compromising privacy.</p>\n<p>This talk will explore how we can:\n    •   Revisit the ATAG 2.0 &amp; We4Authors guidance and align it with today’s AI capabilities. https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/atag/\n    •   Integrate small language models within CMS authoring environments.\n    •   Collaborate across open source communities building on the Open Web Alliance\n    •   Build shared datasets, APIs, and modules to improve author support and accessible defaults.</p>\n<p>Accessibility progress requires shared effort, not just compliance checklists. Let’s use open collaboration and new tools to help every author publish content that works for everyone.</p>",

It will highlight how re-embracing HTML and other markup languages can improve interoperability between platforms and how better tooling can make working with these legacy formats less painful.</p>\n<p>Having a spec-compliant DOM parser is useful, but a spec-compliant and minimally-allocating streaming parser can be a game-changer in high-demand and low-latency applications.

Version 2.0 introduces the ability to automatically generate a tiled and optimised physical layout, simplifying chip-level integration significantly.</p>\n<p>The framework supports extensive customisation, including user-defined primitives, I/O cells, and integrating complex blocks such as CPU cores or ADCs. It has demonstrated superior area density in both standard-cell and custom-cell-based flows and has been validated across more than 15 manufactured chips, spanning 28 nm to 180 nm, including open (SKY130, IHP130, GF180) and industry (TSMC 180, 130, 28) PDKs.

    "abstract": "<p>The use of programmable logic devices, such as FPGAs, requires a range of software tools, from editors for HDL design to the place and route software that maps the design to the physical device and the software that handles the actual configuration process. \nThese are often combined into a coherent IDE to improve efficiency and ease the learning process by offering smooth transitions between the different stages of development, from writing HDL via synthesis, simulation and implementation to the configuration of the device. In the world of FPGAs, these IDEs are mostly proprietary software, developed and owned by the few big FPGA vendors, that only support their own hardware. This means that once design flows are established around one vendor’s software suite, switching to a different vendor’s hardware becomes a tedious or even entirely unworkable task.\nFor years now, pioneers in the open-source community have been steadily working to bridge the gap between commercial and open design tools, to the point that competitive solutions now exist for many aspects of FPGA design. With all the building blocks now available we in the FEntwumS project are now working to integrate a whole range of these tools into one coherent IDE that is as vendor-agnostic as possible and, most importantly, free and open-source.\nAs a representative case study to validate and benchmark this platform, we integrate OpenEye, an open-source and fully FPGA-compatible neural network accelerator developed within the consortium. Its scalable architecture enables us to evaluate the robustness of the toolchain across different device classes and design configurations, testing synthesis behavior, implementation quality and runtime characteristics. By using OpenEye as a practical test vehicle, we ensure transparent evaluation, reproducibility and alignment with the open-source philosophy that underpins the entire project. \nIn this talk, we will present our approach, our current progress, issues we have encountered and our future plans.</p>",

First, HTML fuzzy hashing - a new algorithm that generates structural fingerprints from DOM trees, enabling detection of phishing emails that reuse legitimate templates with modified links. Second, multi-class Bayesian classification that extends the traditional spam/ham model to support up to 20 categories (newsletters, transactional mail, promotions) with single-call Redis lookups. Third, protocol improvements including TCP transport for fuzzy queries and encrypted ZIP archive handling via libarchive. Fourth, neural network refactoring into a provider-based architecture for combining multiple feature sources. We'll also discuss practical experience using LLM tools for code generation, documentation, and PR review during this development cycle - what worked, what didn't, and where human judgment remains essential.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) enable visual customization of HTML emails. However, this flexibility comes at a cost: in this talk, we reveal how CSS creates serious privacy and security vulnerabilities. We demonstrate that CSS facilitates fingerprinting and tracking in HTML emails, even undermining the privacy protections offered by email clients that use proxy services to access remote resources. These tracking capabilities enable targeted phishing and spam campaigns.</p>\n<p>More critically, we present a novel scriptless attack that exploits container queries, lazy-loading fonts, and adaptive ligatures to exfiltrate arbitrary plaintext from PGP-encrypted emails. The attack targets mixed-context scenarios—cases where email clients render both trusted (encrypted) and untrusted (attacker-controlled) HTML content within the same message view. We successfully demonstrate end-to-end exfiltration of PGP-encrypted text from Thunderbird, along with two other major email clients that permit such content mixing.</p>\n<p>These findings expose fundamental gaps in current isolation mechanisms, demonstrating that post-Efail mitigations remain insufficient against CSS-based attacks.</p>",

Using a 1,024-node cluster as a concrete example, we will examine the architectural patterns that make planet-scale email possible, and how similar approaches are used by providers such as Apple iCloud.</p>\n<p>The session covers the full stack of distributed email challenges: storing and indexing messages across a cluster, running spam and phishing filtering at scale without becoming a bottleneck, managing distributed MTA queues for reliable delivery, and load balancing IMAP, JMAP, and SMTP traffic across nodes. We will also look at how Stalwart handles cluster coordination, orchestration, and autoscaling, how to reason about failure scenarios before they occur, and how to adapt a deployment to fluctuating load in dynamic environments.</p>\n<p>Attendees will leave with a practical understanding of how modern distributed email systems are built and operated, and how to apply these principles using open-source technology.</p>",

With the addition of A/V APIs, webgl acceleration, rich media APIs, RTC and, more recently, the wide open field of web assembly-supported features, more or and more of the typical user interaction and applications happens within the browser.</p>\n<p>However, not all processing is meant to happen browser-side. In particular, when dealing with media with potentially large resolutions, exotic formats or complex compute-heavy effects, to provide a full user experience, it might be required to move back and forth between the browser and a backend server processing.</p>\n<p>But this comes with its own sets of challenges: what kind of processing is well suited in the browser? How to best interface a browser-based API with a backend-end based one? How is it possible to transpose a user experience that is built on javascript APIs available in the browser to a backend-based processing where these APIs typically have no bearing.</p>\n<p>In this talk, which is based on some of the challenges faced when building Descript, a feature-rich web-based video editor, we will review some of the technologies that are available to help interfacing web and backend processing, illustrate some of the challenges that these pose and also solve and explore potential future solutions using recent or prospective technologies.</p>",

This led me to studying not only QUIC itself, but also RTP Over QUIC (RoQ) and Media Over QUIC (MoQT).</p>\n<p>As part of my learning process, I started writing a QUIC library, called imquic. While it can (mostly) be used as a generic QUIC/WebTransport library, I also implemented native support within the library for both RoQ and MoQT, as a testbed to use for prototyping the new protocols in an experimental way. This presentation will introduce these new protocols and the imquic library implementing them, talking a bit about the existing demos and the proof-of-concept integration in the Janus WebRTC Server for QUIC-to-WebRTC translation.</p>",

    "url": "https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/DBFZE3-rspace_galaxy_integration/",
    "abstract": "<p>Modern research workflows are often fragmented, requiring scientists to navigate a complex path from the lab bench to computational analysis. The journey typically involves documenting experiments in an electronic lab notebook and then manually transferring data to a separate computational platform for analysis. This process creates inefficiencies, introduces errors, and complicates provenance tracking. To address this challenge, we have developed a tight, two-way integration between two open-source solutions: RSpace, a research data management platform and ELN, and Galaxy, a web-based platform for accessible, reproducible computational analysis. By connecting two open-source platforms, we're building truly open research infrastructure that institutions can adapt to their specific needs while maintaining full control over their research data. </p>\n<p>The integration's foundational step makes RSpace a native repository within Galaxy, enabling researchers to browse their RSpace Gallery and import data directly into Galaxy histories. This connection is bidirectional; not only can data be pulled into Galaxy but also selected outputs or even entire histories can be exported back to RSpace. This creates a seamless FAIR data flow that preserves the critical link between experimental results and their computational context.  </p>\n<p>Building on this foundation, the integration has been further extended to allow researchers to initiate analysis directly from RSpace. By selecting data attached to a document and clicking a Galaxy icon, users upload it into a fresh, systematically-annotated Galaxy history that traces the data to its experimental source. This allows to document field work, launch a complex analysis, monitor its progress, and import the results, all while maintaining a clear and auditable link between the initial data and documentation and the outputs of the final computational analysis.  </p>\n<p>This partnership between two open-source platforms represents a significant stride towards more open, integrated, cohesive research infrastructure that institutions can build upon, reducing friction so scientists can focus on discovery rather than data logistics. Future developments will focus on improving the native repository integration, automated reporting of results back to RSpace, enhanced RO-Crate support for standardized metadata exchange, and improved templating in RSpace for sharing and reusing specific workflow configurations.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>https://galaxyproject.org/</li>\n<li>https://www.researchspace.com/</li>\n<li>https://galaxyproject.org/news/2025-02-27-rspace-talk/</li>\n<li>https://galaxyproject.org/news/2025-06-23-rspace-integration/</li>\n<li>https://www.researchspace.com/blog/rspace-galaxy-filesource-integration</li>\n<li>https://www.researchspace.com/blog/rspace-adds-galaxy-integration</li>\n<li>https://documentation.researchspace.com/article/zzsl46jo5y-galaxy</li>\n</ul>",

These tools enable highly accurate protein structure predictions by leveraging advances in deep learning. However, their implementation can pose technical challenges for users, who must navigate a complex landscape of dependencies and large reference databases. Providing the community with a standardized workflow framework to run these tools could ease adoption.</p>\n<p>Thanks to its adherence to nf-core guidelines, the nf-core/proteinfold pipeline simplifies the application of state-of-the-art protein structure modeling techniques by taking advantage of the optimized execution Nextflow’s capabilities on both cloud providers and HPC infrastructures. The pipeline integrates several popular methods, namely AlphaFold 2 and 3, Boltz 1 and 2, ColabFold, ESMFold, HelixFold, RosettaFoldAA, and RosettaFold2NA. Following structure prediction, nf-core/proteinfold generates an interactive report that allows users to explore and compare predicted models together with standardized confidence metrics, harmonized across methods for consistent interpretation. The workflow also integrates Foldseek-based structural search, enabling the identification of known protein structures similar to the predicted models.</p>\n<p>The pipeline is developed through an international collaboration that includes Australian BioCommons, the Centre for Genomic Regulation, Pompeu Fabra University, and the European Bioinformatics Institute, and it already serves as a central resource for structure prediction at several of these organisations and others. This broad adoption demonstrates how nf-core/proteinfold, through its open-source and community-driven development model, is lowering the barrier to using deep learning based approaches for protein structure prediction in everyday research.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, nf core proteinfold represents a new generation of Nextflow workflows designed to place multiple alternative methods for the same task within one coherent framework.

    "slug": "YCJBJN-interproscan6",
    "url": "https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/YCJBJN-interproscan6/",
    "abstract": "<p>The rate of sequencing novel biological constructs far outpaces the capacity for accurate laboratory-based functional annotation. Computational methods help prioritise research and manage resources, yet protein function prediction remains a core challenge in bioinformatics. InterProScan is a widely adopted tool for functional annotation, scanning protein sequences against predictive models, including HMMs and BLAST PSSMs, and mapping results to InterPro entries. This facilitates assignment of Gene Ontology (GO) terms, pathways, and other curated data. InterProScan is integral to genome annotation pipelines like UniProt, Ensembl, and MGnify Genomes.</p>\n<p>InterProScan 5 introduced a Java-based architecture capable of coordinating multiple analyses across compute environments. However, its monolithic design and tight coupling to specific data releases created challenges: users had to download large bundles and manage dependencies manually, complicating installation and reproducibility.</p>\n<p>To address these issues, we present InterProScan 6, a complete reimplementation using the Nextflow workflow management system. Designed for flexibility, scalability, and reproducibility, it incorporates modular data handling, modern container technologies, and improved integration mechanisms.</p>\n<p>InterProScan 6 is a modular Nextflow pipeline, enabling parallelisation and scalability across environments ranging from local systems to HPC (e.g. Slurm, LSF) and cloud platforms (e.g. AWS, Google Cloud). Users need only install Nextflow and a container engine (e.g. Docker, Singularity); all other dependencies are bundled in containers and automatically retrieved by the workflow, ensuring consistent environments and simplifying setup.</p>\n<p>InterProScan 6 supports predictive tools from InterPro member databases (e.g. CDD, Pfam) and others like AntiFam, Coils, and MobiDB-lite. It also integrates advanced deep learning predictors: TMHMM is replaced by TMbed for transmembrane helix prediction, and SignalP 4.1 by SignalP 6.0. The architecture allows easy integration of new methods without altering the core pipeline.</p>\n<p>Another major improvement is the decoupling of code and data. Unlike prior versions, software and data are no longer distributed as a single package. Users can specify the InterPro data version at runtime (via ‘--interpro <version>’), enabling reproducibility and cross-version comparisons without reinstallation.</p>\n<p>To lower the storage burden and improve usability, InterProScan 6 introduces on-demand data retrieval. By invoking the pipeline with the ‘--applications’ and ‘--interpro’ parameters, the workflow automatically fetches only the necessary signature data required for the selected analyses and InterPro version. This significantly reduces disk usage and simplifies setup for users only interested in a subset of available tools.</p>\n<p>Containerisation is central to InterProScan 6’s design. Every pipeline step is executed within a defined container image, bundling all required software and system libraries. Profiles for Docker, Singularity, and Apptainer are included, allowing users to run the pipeline consistently across different environments. This approach removes the need for manual dependency management, simplifies troubleshooting, and greatly enhances reproducibility.</p>\n<p>InterProScan 5 uses the Match Lookup Service, a web service that provides precomputed matches for known sequences. When sequences are scanned with InterProScan, their MD5 checksums are submitted to this service, which returns existing annotations for recognised sequences, allowing InterProScan to bypass redundant local computation and improve performance. However, the original Match Lookup Service was purpose-built for InterProScan 5 and not designed for broader accessibility, representing a missed opportunity to share over 14 billion matches derived from 1 billion sequences with the wider research community. To address this, the Match Lookup Service has been reimplemented as the Matches API (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/matches/api), a modern, developer-friendly, RESTful web service. The Matches API supports programmatic submission of up to 100 sequence checksums per request and returns results in JSON format consistent with InterProScan 6 output. Unlike the original service, the API also returns associated InterPro entries for matches linked to integrated signatures, as well as residue-level annotations for CDD, SFLD, and PIRSR. Furthermore, support for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) allows client-side web applications to directly access the API, greatly facilitating integration of InterPro annotations into external tools and analysis pipelines.</p>\n<p>InterProScan 6 is available under the Apache 2.0 open source license, and distributed via GitHub (https://github.com/ebi-pf-team/interproscan6/), with containers hosted on DockerHub. Extensive documentation and example configurations are provided to help users deploy and customise the pipeline for diverse annotation scenarios.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Advances in DNA sequencing and synthesis have made reading and writing genetic code faster and cheaper than ever. Yet most labs run experiments at the same scale they did a decade ago, not because the biology is limiting, but because the software hasn't caught up.</p>\n<p>The conventional digital representation of a genome is a string of nucleotides. This works well enough for simple projects, but the model breaks down as complexity grows. Sequences aren't constant: they evolve, mutate, and are iterated on. Unlike software, there's no instant feedback loop to tell you if an edit worked; wetlab experiments take time. You gain some of that time back by working with multiple sequences in parallel. But keeping track of thousands of sequences and coordinate frames is tricky at best when a researcher is working solo, and far harder when collaborating with other people or agents on the same genetic codebase.</p>\n<p>Gen is a version control system built specifically for biological sequences (http://github.com/genhub-bio/gen). It models genomic data as a graph rather than flat text, preserving the full structure of variation, editing history, and experimental lineage. On top of this, projects are organized into repositories with branching, diffing, and merging, just like git. Git was first released 20 years ago and transformed how software teams collaborate on shared codebases. Gen brings that same workflow to biology.</p>\n<p>This talk will introduce Gen's design philosophy and walk through a real-world use case.

    "abstract": "<p>AI is gaining importance in bioinformatics with new methods and tools popping every day. While applications of AI in bioinformatics inherited a lot of technological solutions from other AI-driven fields, such as image recognition or natural language processing, this particular domain has its own challenges. An alarming example is a study showing that most AI models for detecting COVID from radiographs do not rely on medically relevant pathological signals, but rather in shortcuts such as text tokens on the images (DeGrave et al., Nat Mach Intell, 2021, doi: 10.1038/s42256-021-00338-7), stressing the importance of the data, on which the AI models were trained. Equally special is the data used for training biological language models: first, it is not that large compared to natural languages (e.g. one of the most successful protein language models ESM-2 has been trained on only 250M sequences), and second, it is highly structured by evolution and natural selection, and thus has a relatively low intrinsic dimension.</p>\n<p>In my talk, I will speak about consequences of this underlying structure of the data for performance of models that are trained with it -- spoiler alert! it is terribly overestimated. The reason for this is information or data leakage: the model remembers irrelevant features highly correlated with the target variable and does not learn any biologically meaningful properties that can be transferred to out-of-distribution data. I will present our own check list (see our paper Bernett et al., Nat Methods, 2024, doi: 10.1038/s41592-024-02362-y) and a solution (https://github.com/kalininalab/DataSAIL, Joeres et al., Nat Comm, 2025, doi: 10.1038/s41467-025-58606-8) for avoiding the information leakage pitfall. I will discuss examples and applications from protein function prediction and drug discovery.</p>",

    "url": "https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/9VLSXV-movement-tracks-python/",
    "abstract": "<p>The study of animal behaviour has been transformed by the increasing use of machine learning-based tools, such as DeepLabCut and SLEAP, which can track the positions of animals and their body parts from video footage. However, there is currently no user-friendly, general-purpose solution for processing and analysing the motion tracks generated by these tools. To address this gap, we are developing movement, an open-source Python package that provides a unified interface for analysing motion tracking data from multiple formats. Initially, movement prioritised implementing methods for data cleaning and kinematic analysis. We are now focusing on expanding its data visualization capabilities and on developing metrics to analyze how animals interact with each other and with their environment. Future plans include adding modules for specialised applications such as pupillometry and collective behaviour, as well as supporting integration with neurophysiological data analysis tools. Importantly, movement is designed to cater to researchers with varying levels of coding expertise and computational resources, featuring an intuitive graphical user interface. Furthermore, the project is committed to transparency, with dedicated engineers collaborating with a global community of contributors to ensure its long-term sustainability. We invite feedback from the community to help shape movement's future as a comprehensive toolbox for analysing animal behaviour.

    "abstract": "<p>Tabular data, often scattered across multiple tables, is the primary output of data analyses in virtually all scientific fields. Exchange and communication of tabular data is therefore a central challenge. With Datavzrd, we present a tool for creating portable, visually rich, interactive reports from tabular data in any kind of scientific discipline. Datavzrd unifies the strengths of currently common generic approaches for interactive visualization like R Shiny with the portability, ease of use and sustainability of plain spreadsheets. The generated reports do not require the maintenance of a web server nor the installation of specialized software for viewing and can simply be attached to emails, shared via cloud services, or serve as manuscript supplements. They can be specified without requiring imperative programming, thereby enabling rapid development and offering accessibility for non-computational scientists, unlocking the look and feel of dedicated manually crafted web applications without the maintenance and development burden. Datavzrd reports scale from small tables to thousands or millions of rows and offer the ability to link multiple related tables, allowing to jump between corresponding rows or hierarchically explore growing levels of detail. We will demonstrate Datavzrd on real-world bioinformatics examples from tools such as Orthanq and Varlociraptor, highlighting how it can turn complex analytical outputs into interactive, shareable reports.</p>\n<p>Software: https://github.com/datavzrd/datavzrd\nGeneral Website: https://datavzrd.github.io</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>The MapLibre community is currently in the midst of developing the MapLibre Tile Format, a modern, open, and fully community-governed successor to the ubiquitous Mapbox Vector Tile (MVT) format. While MVT has served the mapping ecosystem well for over a decade, it also carries historical constraints that limit interoperability, formal specification quality, extensibility, and independence from proprietary platforms. As MapLibre continues to grow as the central open-source foundation for web-based map rendering, it has become increasingly clear that a future-proof, openly specified, and collaboratively designed tile format is essential.</p>\n<p>This talk will offer a look into why we initiated this engineering effort and what gaps the new format aims to close. I will explain the core design principles behind the specification—clarity, strictness where needed, optionality where useful, and full transparency throughout the process. Attendees will gain a technical understanding of how the format works, including its data model, feature encoding strategy, metadata approach, and compatibility considerations for existing infrastructure.</p>\n<p>Beyond the current specification draft, I will outline the major areas still under active development. These include discussions about schema evolution, advanced geometry representations, compression strategies, and interoperability with raster, elevation, 3D  and non-geographic datasets. I will also provide insight into the collaborative workflow between maintainers, researchers, vendors, and the wider open-source community, highlighting where contributions and feedback are particularly welcome.</p>\n<p>Finally, the talk will cover how the rollout is progressing in practice. This includes early tooling support, reference implementations, testing frameworks, and real-world trials by organizations exploring migration paths away from MVT. The session will present an honest, up-to-date snapshot of the project’s status and a forward-looking roadmap for the next stages of development, helping the community understand both what is ready today and what is still on the horizon.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>In an era of unprecedented availability of Earth Observation (EO) data, the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem (CDSE)(https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/) plays a key role in bridging the gap between data accessibility and actionable insights. Despite the availability of freely accessible satellite data, the widespread adoption of EO applications remains limited due to challenges in extracting meaningful information. Many EO-based projects struggle with non-repeatable, non-reusable workflows, mainly due to the lack of standardized, scalable solutions. \nCDSE tackles these barriers by adopting common standards and patterns, most notably through openEO(https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/analyse/openeo). This open-source solution is a community-driven standard that simplifies access to, processing, and analysis of remote sensing data by offering a unified platform. It empowers developers, researchers, and data scientists to use cloud-based resources and distributed computing environments to tackle complex geospatial challenges. Adhering to the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable), it supports the global sharing and reuse of algorithms, enhancing collaboration and scalability. <br />\nFurthermore, by promoting the development of reusable, scalable, and shareable workflows, openEO enhances the efficiency and reproducibility of the EO workflow. Its feature-rich capabilities have also been used and validated in large-scale operational projects such as ESA WorldCereal and the JRC Copernicus Global Land Cover and Tropical Forestry Mapping and Monitoring Service (LCFM), which relies on its robust and reliable infrastructure. \nThrough this session, we aim to present users with openEO and its capabilities. We will highlight how users can seamlessly convert algorithms into a process graph, thereby creating reusable services.</p>",

The initial pilot focuses on Kajiado County, Kenya, where heat stress, water scarcity, and shifting vector-borne disease risk create urgent planning needs.</p>\n<p>We’ll highlight what works, what’s hard, and what’s next: data interoperability, scalable analytics, offline-friendly UX for low-bandwidth contexts, and governance for sustainable local ownership. We’re actively seeking collaborators to co-develop Climate Pulse—especially on geospatial data layers, standards alignment, and field testing—so that open climate intelligence can meaningfully support health systems under pressure.</p>",

    "abstract": "<h1>Harnessing Hardware for High-Performance Traffic Management in VPP</h1>\n<p><strong>Traffic Management (TM)</strong> is critical for predictable network performance. It controls packet priority, shapes transmission rates, and allocates bandwidth to meet SLAs in large-scale deployments such as ISPs, telecom networks, and data centers.</p>\n<p><strong>FD.io Vector Packet Processing (VPP)</strong>, a widely adopted high-performance networking stack across these environments, currently relies on <strong>software-based TM</strong>. This introduces bottlenecks at scale: CPU overhead grows with traffic classes, latency spikes under load, and token bucket waste cycles. At 100G/200G and beyond, these limitations pose a critical risk of <strong>SLA violations</strong>. </p>\n<p>The new TM framework addresses these challenges by <strong>offloading shaping and scheduling to hardware</strong> through a <strong>vendor-neutral</strong> architecture and a <strong>unified API</strong> that works across all platforms supporting traffic management in silicon. </p>\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>The proposed TM framework integrates VPP with hardware traffic management engines in supported NICs, SmartNICs, and DPUs. It detects hardware capabilities, classifies flows in software, and steers them to hardware queues where TM policies are enforced at line rate—eliminating software-based per-packet arbitration.</p>\n<h2>Key Features</h2>\n<p><strong>Hierarchical Scheduling:</strong> Organizes traffic into multi-level queues to prioritize critical services while preserving fairness across remaining traffic. \n<strong>Dual-Rate Shaping:</strong> Applies committed and peak rate control with burst handling, compliant with RFC 2698, to prevent congestion and maintain predictable performance. \n<strong>Priority and Fairness:</strong> Combines strict priority for latency-sensitive traffic with weighted sharing for bulk flows to balance resources. \n<strong>Policing:</strong> Enforces traffic limits at line rate by dropping or marking packets appropriately.</p>\n<h2>Advantages of Traffic Management in Hardware</h2>\n<p><strong>Performance:</strong> Delivers line-rate Traffic Management with high accuracy and low latency. \n<strong>Scalability:</strong> Supports thousands of queues at line rates without proportional CPU costs. \n<strong>Efficiency:</strong> Shifts workload to hardware, enabling CPUs to focus on application logic while reducing energy usage \n<strong>Reliability:</strong> Ensures stable Quality of Service under peak load conditions. </p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Hardware-assisted TM is no longer optional—it is mission-critical for networks scaling toward 400G/800G with diverse traffic and tight latency budgets. The VPP TM framework delivers this through a vendor-neutral API, <strong>making VPP ready for demanding telecom and data center workloads</strong> while preserving its modular design. For open-source stacks like VPP, this is not just an enhancement—it’s a long-overdue capability.</p>",

This methodology drives terabit-class packet and session performance on commodity x86/Arm - reliably and repeatably.\nTakeaways: a replicable recipe (tools, configs, artifacts) for your lab; why benchmarks-as-code beat ad-hoc testing; and concrete contribution paths across CSIT and VPP (tests, profiles, analysers, data visualisation).</p>\n<p>Relevant links:\nhttps://fd.io/\nhttps://csit.fd.io/\nhttps://wiki.fd.io/\nhttps://github.com/FDio/</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Rethink Firewall is the most downloaded FOSS network security tool on F-Droid for Android devices. For seemingly always-on, always-connected smartphones, on-device firewalls are notoriously hard to implement and maintain. This talk is about how 3 unsuspecting developers frustrated by digital surveillance and internet censorship got together, using the $12k in grant awarded by Mozilla in 2020, to build the missing \"network sandbox\" for 3B+ Android users, and the financial, technical, systemic challenges they faced along the way: From fighting the networking gods to make IPv6 work across a garden variety of topologies, to pushing the limits of SQLite for real-time stats &amp; capturing network flows, to using Rethink itself to monitor &amp; block its own egress, to testing the frontier of packet manipulation (for Deep Packet Inspection censorship resistance) and IP/domain filtering (supporting over 12 million entries) an Android app can achieve consuming limited resources (battery, processor, and memory), all the while supporting multiple WireGuard upstreams at once through open source virtualization layer (gVisor) Google built for its cloud servers! With a stream of recommendations from GrapheneOS, CalyxOS, DivestOS, the Guardian Project developers, and the varied feature-set Rethink packs, has made it the most downloaded (and probably the most confusing) WireGuard client on F-Droid.</p>\n<p>Since Aug 2020, we've also been operating Rethink DNS, an anycast, public, censorship-resistant, highly-available DNS resolver serving 40bn requests per month &amp; 400 TB / month in traffic at peak. It has been subject to DDoS attempts &amp; bans by state actors. It is used in the default configuration by some popular anti-censorship projects like VLess, Hiddify, and I2P. The costs for Rethink DNS is paid for by its lead developers and partially by grants from FOSS United, an Indian non-profit. Besides discussing the software optimizations on both the client and server to bring down the costs, an unexpected lending hand from Cloudflare played a major role in handling traffic surges and keeping bad actors in check.</p>\n<p>An anti-censorship and anti-surveillance tool for non-rooted Android devices is something we wished existed. We thought we'd be done in a year, but it is year #5 and we've so much left to do, as new users bring in newer feature requests, which mean more bugs and higher costs, too. To give a sense of our strong purpose, the toll of having drawn no salary for 5 years yet feeding our kids, living a frugal lifestyle just so this thing that we're building would exist, is not something our wives take very lightly!</p>\n<p>Code:\nhttps://github.com/celzero/rethink-app (the UI)\nhttps://github.com/celzero/firestack (the network engine)\nhttps://github.com/serverless-dns/serverless-dns (the resolver)</p>",

We will showcase its seamless integration with the cloud-native ecosystem, specifically enabling L3 EVPN tunneling to common Kubernetes network components like Calico and MetalLB.\nAdditionally, we will demonstrate how OpenPERouter naturally extends to virtual machine networks by achieving a cross-cluster Layer 2 overlay using EVPN, VXLAN, and KubeVirt.

We will start with a brief overview of GoBGP's architecture and its gRPC/HTTP APIs, then dive into how those APIs can be leveraged to build a flexible control plane that reacts in real time to external events (for example, service discovery, telemetry feedback, or orchestration workflows).</p>\n<p>The core of the session focuses on multi‑tenancy and operational aspects:\n- Building logical separation between tenants while sharing the same GoBGP control plane.\n- Mapping tenants to their own BGP server, route policies, and address families, and keeping configuration manageable as the number of tenants grows.\n- Handling dynamic tenant lifecycle events (creation, updates, deletion) through the API without disrupting existing sessions.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Deploying a Private 5G network has traditionally been the domain of proprietary vendors with complex, closed hardware. However, the maturity of open-source projects now allows engineers to build fully functional networks using standard servers and open software. Using purely open-source components requires precise orchestration of the hardware and software stack. This session aims to demonstrate a complete, end-to-end O-RAN deployment blueprint on top of OpenNebula. We will explain how to orchestrate the srsRAN suite (providing the centralized and distributed units) and Open5GS (the 5G Core). We will dive into the specific infrastructure requirements for running latency-sensitive telco workloads, focusing on Enhanced Platform Awareness (EPA) features. Attendees will learn how to configure SR-IOV and Passthrough for optimized network throughput, implement CPU Pinning and NUMA awareness for performance isolation, and manage Precision Time Protocol (PTP) synchronization from the host to the guest VM. The session will include a walkthrough of the automation blueprints used to configure 5G-ready edge nodes and instantiate verified telco appliances from the OpenNebula Marketplace.</p>",

At Meta, we observed that 17% of our jobs fail due to RDMA-related syscall errors which arise due to bugs in the RDMA driver code. Unlike other parts of the Kernel RDMA-related syscalls are opaque and the errors create a mismatched application/kernel view of hardware resources. As a result of this opacity and mismatch existing observability tools provided limited visibility and DevOps found it challenging to triage – we required a new scalable framework to analyze kernel state and identify the cause of this mismatch.</p>\n<p>Direct approaches like tracing the kernel calls and capturing meta involved in the systems turned out to be prohibitively expensive. In this talk, we will describe the set of optimizations used to scale tracking kernel state and the map-based systems designed to efficiently export relevant state without impacting production workloads.</p>",

This is what Cillium currently still does. Compiling on target empowered a core value of Cilium: \"you do not pay for what you do not use\".

    "abstract": "<p>XDP and AF_XDP provide a high-performance mechanism for driver-layer packet processing and zero-copy delivery of packets into userspace, while maintaining access to standard kernel networking constructs — capabilities that distinguish them from full kernel-bypass frameworks such as DPDK. However, the current AF_XDP implementation offers no efficient in-kernel mechanism for forwarding packets between AF_XDP sockets in a zero-copy manner. Because AF_XDP operates without the conventional full network stack socket abstraction, even basic localhost redirection requires an external switch or additional hardware-assisted NIC capabilities, limiting both performance and usability.</p>\n<p>In this talk, we introduce FLASH, an extension to the AF_XDP subsystem that enables low-overhead, in-kernel packet transfer between AF_XDP sockets. FLASH provides zero-copy delivery for sockets that share a memory area and a fast single-copy datapath for sockets backed by independent memories. The design incorporates several performance-oriented mechanisms, including smart blocking with backpressure for congestion handling and an adaptive interrupt-to-busypoll transition to reduce latency under load.</p>\n<p>We demonstrate that co-located applications using AF_XDP can leverage FLASH to achieve up to 2.5× higher throughput compared to SR-IOV-based approaches, while preserving the programming model and flexibility of the XDP/AF_XDP ecosystem. The talk will also outline future directions and how this technique can be applied across different use cases like DDoS mitigation, load balancing, etc.    </p>\n<p>Github link - https://github.com/networkedsystemsIITB/flash</p>",

    "slug": "N9QWXR-ebpf-io-monitoring",
    "url": "https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/N9QWXR-ebpf-io-monitoring/",
    "abstract": "<p>The interoperability of I/O monitoring and profiling tools is very limited due to their strong dependence on the underlying file system (LUSTRE, Spectrum Scale, NFS, etc) and resource managers (batch jobs, VMs, containerized workloads, etc). Widely adopted generic monitoring tools often lack the temporal information of the I/O activity which is often required to understand the I/O behavior of the applications. The increasing diversity of applications and computing platforms demands greater flexibility and scope in I/O characterization. This talk proposes a framework for monitoring I/O activity using extended Berkley Packet Filter (eBPF) technology which has gained much traction in observability and cloud-native landscape. By tracing the kernel’s Virtual File System (VFS) functions with eBPF, it is possible to monitor the I/O activity on different types of platforms like HPC, cloud hypervisors or Kubernetes. By storing the metrics traced by eBPF programs in a high performance time series database like Prometheus, it is possible to perform system-wide monitoring of computing platforms that use different types of local or\nremote file systems in a unified manner. The current talk presents the basics of eBPF and discusses the framework that is used to monitor I/O activity in a file system and application agnostic way. It also presents the experimental results of quantifying the overhead and accuracy of the proposed framework using IOR benchmark results as the reference. The results indicate that there is negligible overhead in using the framework and bandwidths reported by the proposed methodology are in a very\ngood agreement with the ones from IOR tests. Finally, results from a production HPC platform that uses the proposed framework to monitor I/O activity on the LUSTRE file system are presented.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>When it comes to string handling, C is not the most ergonomic language for the job. But, at least, the standard library provides a basic set of functions for finding characters, comparing strings, or finding sub-strings. The same has not been true for eBPF programs where developers had to implement all the operations manually by looking into individual bytes.</p>\n<p>This has changed in kernel version 6.17, which added a set of eBPF kernel functions (so-called kfuncs) to perform the most common string processing operations. While implementing these sounded like a very straightforward job at the beginning (just call the in-kernel implementations of the respective functions, right?), it turned out that eBPF programs have a number of specifics which required the implementation to be much more complicated.</p>\n<p>In this talk, I will walk you through this journey and show how and why the kfuncs have to be implemented differently from the in-kernel implementations. We'll also dive into the API specifics and demonstrate how string kfuncs have been adopted by bpftrace [1] and what benefits they brought.</p>\n<p>[1] https://bpftrace.org/</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>eBPF is a powerful technology, but it is often hard to use, because its\ntoolchain is non-trivial. In my talk I present\n<a href=\"https://github.com/tecki/ebpfcat\">EBPFCat</a>, a pure Python library that can\ngenerate eBPF directly without any dependency on other code beyond the Linux\nkernel. Unlike most eBPF implementations, no compiler is involved. Instead, the\nuser writes Python code which generates eBPF on-the-fly at runtime.</p>\n<p>In EBPFCat, user- and kernel space are tightly integrated, so\nthat both eBPF and Python code can access the same data structures. This way,\none can use eBPF to write the performance critical parts of a program, while\nretaining the versatility of Python for the bulk of the code. This opens eBPF\nto a large audience who are interested in the performance boost by eBPF, but\nare hesitant to learn an entirely new tool set for it.</p>\n<p>I will go through a simple example to show that using EBPFCat it is possible to\nfit an entire eBPF program including its user space counterpart on a single\npresentation slide. For this example I also show how EBPFCat generates the eBPF\nbytecode.</p>\n<p>While EBPFCat can be employed for usual eBPF use cases, I present one well\nbeyond typical systems-level applications: motion control. EtherCAT is a\nstandard field bus protocol based on EtherNet. Using eBPF we can reduce the\nlatency of communication with EtherCAT devices, allowing for real-time\nperformance. I will show a real-world combined motion system for physics\nresearch that routinely uses EBPFCat.</p>\n<p>Developers new to eBPF will get a jump start into everything needed for their\nfirst project, while experienced kernel developers will be surprised just how\nfar eBPF can take you beyond system programming.</p>\n<p>Links:\n<a href=\"https://github.com/tecki/ebpfcat\">EBPFCat on github</a>\n<a href=\"https://ebpfcat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\">EBPFCat on readthedocs</a></p>",

In this talk, we will highlight what has changed, what’s coming next, and how these developments shape the Rust-and-eBPF ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Over the last year, Aya has gained support for several new eBPF program types, as well as additional map types, such as the family of storage maps (sk_storage, task_storage, inode_storage). We’ve worked with the LLVM community to enable <a href=\"https://docs.kernel.org/bpf/btf.html\">BTF</a> generation for Rust eBPF programs. The overall developer experience has continued to improve, and an increasing number of open-source projects are now building on top of Aya.</p>\n<p>We will also share updates on our ongoing work, most notably our efforts to promote Rust’s eBPF targets to <a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/target-tier-policy.html#tier-2-target-policy\">Tier 2</a>, paving the way for building eBPF programs on Rust stable without requiring nightly toolchains. Alongside this, we are developing support for BTF relocation emission, refining the user-space XDP API, and broadening coverage of program and map types.</p>\n<p>The talk will dive into the technical details behind these features, the architectural decisions that shaped them, and the challenges ahead.

Used for in-app browsers, hybrid apps, and <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/miniapps/\">MiniApps</a>, WebViews form a significant part of the web platform that many developers unknowingly target. Some developers specifically build for WebViews in hybrid apps or MiniApps, while others create standard websites without realizing they'll run in WebView contexts with different behaviors and constraints. </p>\n<p>Through initiatives like <a href=\"https://caniwebview.com/baseline\">Baseline</a>, <a href=\"https://caniwebview.com\">CanIWebView</a>, <a href=\"https://caniwebview.com/apps\">apps</a>, and the <a href=\"https://github.com/WebView-CG\">WebView Community Group</a>, we're working to map this fragmented landscape and identify paths forward. MiniApps that are very popular in some markets also show a very strong fragmentation and very little standardization. With collaboration and improvements between WebViews, MiniApps, PWA, new technologies like <a href=\"https://chromeos.dev/en/web/isolated-web-apps\">Isolated Web Apps</a> or new engines like Servo there is good potential to improve the web in this space, but it's complicated.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/community/webview/\">W3C WebView Community Group</a> was formed to identify, understand, and reduce the issues arising from the use of software components (typically referred as WebViews) that are used to render Web technology-based content. As member and co-chair of the community group I'd like to give a little overview what WebViews are today, the work we've done to improve interoperability, and call to action to \"fix things\" in this overlooked but critical part of the web platform.</p>",

Resumable uploads, on the other hand, allow an application to continue uploading a file exactly where it left off. This preserves previously transferred data and greatly improves the user experience.</p>\n<p>Historically, resumable uploads were implemented in proprietary ways, with each application building its own solution. Developers couldn’t benefit from the advantages of resumable uploads without investing significant engineering effort.</p>\n<p>In 2013, we started the <a href=\"https://tus.io\">tus project</a> and created a free and open-source protocol for resumable uploads. The project and its community provide implementations for various client and server runtimes, making it easy today to add resumable uploads to any application.</p>\n<p>In 2022, we began engaging with the HTTP Working Group at the IETF to make resumable uploads a standardized extension to HTTP.

    "abstract": "<p>A large number of Linux applications have been developed over the years. Reusing them allows developers to reduce development costs, leverage well-established and battle-tested applications, and gain significant benefits by porting them to WebAssembly (Wasm). Migrating Linux applications to the browser as Wasm offers several advantages, such as:\n    1.  Developing browser-based applications by reusing existing Linux libraries\n    2.  Protecting client privacy and reducing server load by moving server-side Linux applications into the browser\n    3.  Building browser-based systems that rely on Linux applications that are traditionally difficult to port (e.g., shells, compilers)</p>\n<p>In this session, I will introduce elfconv, a binary translator that directly converts existing Linux binaries into Wasm without requiring their source code and provides a layer for emulating Linux system calls. This enables Linux applications that depend on system calls unavailable in Wasm (e.g., fork/exec) to run inside the browser.\nFurthermore, by performing ahead-of-time (AOT) translation, elfconv achieves dramatically lower overhead compared to CPU-emulator-based projects such as container2wasm and v86. Our evaluation on several benchmark tests shows that elfconv delivers approximately 30× to 70× higher performance.\nAt the moment, the system call emulation layer in particular is still under development, but I believe that as elfconv matures, it will greatly expand the potential of the browser.</p>\n<p>elfconv: https://github.com/yomaytk/elfconv\ncontainer2wasm: https://github.com/container2wasm/container2wasm\nv86: https://github.com/copy/v86</p>",

    "abstract": "<p><a href=\"https://github.com/oasis-tcs/virtio-spec\">VIRTIO</a> is the open standard for virtual I/O, supported by a wide range of hypervisors and operating systems. Typically, device emulation is performed directly inside the Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM), like <a href=\"https://www.qemu.org/\">QEMU</a>. However, modern virtualization stacks support multiple implementation models: keeping the device in the VMM, moving it to the kernel (vhost), offloading it to an external user-space process (vhost-user), or offloading it directly to the hardware (vDPA).</p>\n<p>Each approach comes with specific trade-offs. Emulating in the VMM is straightforward but can be a bottleneck. In-kernel emulation offers high performance but increases the attack surface of the host system. External processes provide excellent isolation and flexibility, but introduce complexity. Finally, vDPA (vhost Data Path Acceleration) enables wire-speed performance with standard VIRTIO drivers, but introduces hardware dependencies.</p>\n<p>So, how do we decide which approach is best for a specific use case?</p>\n<p>In this talk, we will explore all four methods for emulating VIRTIO devices. We will analyze the architectural differences, discuss the pros and cons regarding performance and security, and provide guidance on how to choose the right architecture for your use case.</p>",

This architecture facilitates deterministic cross-cluster live migrations, better supports legacy workloads needing broadcast/multicast, and enables migrating workloads into the KubeVirt cluster while preserving original networking using open components. Routing domains are also supported for traffic segregation and to provide direct routed ingress to VMs, eliminating the need for Kubernetes services to expose ports.</p>\n<p>Attendees will gain the practical knowledge to design and implement resilient, operationally safe, EVPN-based overlays with OpenPERouter, receiving actionable design patterns and configuration examples.</p>",

We'll explore the current state of WebAssembly in the cloud-native ecosystem: what's production-ready today, and where you should wait before adopting.\nBeyond the basics, we'll look at real-world Cloud-Native Compute Foundation (CNCF) projects already running WASM in production and discuss the two areas where WebAssembly shines: plugin architectures that benefit from small, secure, sandboxed extensibility, and event-driven systems that can quickly scale from zero. Whether you're optimizing for resource efficiency or exploring new isolation patterns, this session provides insights into WebAssembly on Kubernetes and serves as a great starting point.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>With KubeVirt, Virtual Machines become first-class citizens in Kubernetes, allowing VMs and containers to be managed through a unified control plane. As organizations evolve their infrastructure, many early adopters face the challenge of upgrading systems without disrupting essential services. To support this, KubeVirt provides powerful mobility capabilities for both compute and storage.</p>\n<p>KubeVirt enables non-shared storage live migration through QEMU's block migration feature, which is orchestrated by libvirt and KubeVirt components. The core process involves copying the VM's disk data and memory state to the destination node while the VMI remains running.</p>\n<p>Cross-Cluster Live Migration (CCLM) extends this capability across Kubernetes clusters, allowing a running VM to be moved seamlessly between clusters. This enhances flexibility and resilience in multi-cluster environments and is especially useful for load balancing, maintenance operations, and infrastructure consolidation – all without interrupting critical workloads. CCLM requires L2 network connectivity between clusters and compatible CPU architectures.</p>\n<p>Storage Live Migration (SLM) allows you to move the VM’s disk data from one storage backend to another while the VM remains running. This is particularly valuable when rebalancing storage usage, retiring legacy systems, or adopting new storage classes – all without disrupting the applications inside the VM. SLM requires at least two compatible nodes.</p>\n<p>Both CCLM and SLM work with any storage backend, including those using the ReadWriteOnce access mode.</p>\n<p>After the session, you’ll be ready to migrate your running VMs – across clusters and across storage – with confidence, like a seasoned scheduler placing pods exactly where they need to be.</p>",

One of the most edgy use cases is to run an AI coding agent inside a VM, in order to isolate the agent from direct access to host files and commands. This setup ensures that even if an AI agent is deceived by malicious instructions searched from the Internet (e.g., fake package installations), any potential damage is confined within the VM, or limited to files specified to be mounted from the host.</p>\n<p>This talk introduces the updates in Lima v2.0 (November 2025) that facilitates using Lima with AI:\n- Plugin infrastructure\n- GPU acceleration\n- MCP server\n- CLI improvements</p>\n<p>Web site: https://lima-vm.io\nGitHub: https://github.com/lima-vm/lima</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Virtualization has transformed low-level debugging, system analysis, and malware research. By placing a thin hypervisor beneath the OS, developers gain a vantage point the OS cannot access. This blue-pill approach enables fine-grained control over CPU state, memory, interrupts, and hardware events without relying on OS components, supporting transparent breakpoints, VM-exit triggers, memory shadowing, and instruction tracing with minimal interference.</p>\n<p>We present HyperDbg, an open-source hypervisor-based debugger. Leveraging the former characteristics, unlike kernel debuggers that depend on drivers, APIs, or software breakpoints, HyperDbg operates entirely below the OS, combining virtualization-based introspection with interactive debugging. It inspects memory, CPU execution, and traps events without OS cooperation, bypassing anti-debugging and anti-analysis techniques.</p>\n<p>Using modern virtualization extensions like Mode Based Execution Control (MBEC) on top of Second Level Address Translation (SLAT), HyperDbg enforces breakpoints and traps through hardware transitions, independent of OS APIs or exceptions. This allows stealthy, artifact-free binary analysis, providing a powerful platform for reverse engineering and research. In its first iteration, HyperDbg introduced a hypervisor-powered kernel debugger. With the recent release of v0.15, HyperDbg enables cross-boundary debugging from kernel-mode into user-mode. For this talk, we will add special focus on how we implemented cross-boundary debugging, and how it enables users to intercept user-mode process execution using virtualization techniques.</p>\n<p>Resources:\n- HyperDbg repository: https://github.com/HyperDbg/HyperDbg/\n- Documentation: https://docs.hyperdbg.org/\n- Kernel-mode debugger design: https://research.hyperdbg.org/debugger/kernel-debugger-design/\n- Research paper: https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3548606.3560649</p>",

Today, the vast majority of Fedora packages have already been ported to riscv64 (i.e. the RV64GC baseline) and OS images—both generic and board-specific—are available for recent releases.</p>\n<p>RISC-V is currently an <em>alternative</em> architecture in Fedora, so these (non-official) images are built by a dedicated team of community contributors, the Fedora RISC-V team. However, the end goal is to make RISC-V a <em>primary</em> architecture on Fedora.</p>\n<p>So, what changed since the last update at DevConf 2024? What does the path for RISC-V to become a primary architecture on Fedora look like? What are we currently working on and what are our future plans?</p>\n<p>Beyond software, we'll also survey the current hardware reality. Today several development boards are available. If one is getting started with RISC-V today, what board to pick? We'll review the available hardware, from the \"VisionFive 2\" to other capable boards, and outline our experience building Fedora on it.</p>\n<p>Finally, whether you have a board on your desk or just a desire to contribute, there are many ways to help push Fedora’s RISC-V journey across the finish line.

Toolchains, kernel support, hypervisors, RTOSes  and simulators are all evolving, but progress happens at different speeds across the stack.

    "abstract": "<p>The last decade of CPU vulnerabilities has shown how microarchitectural performance optimizations can undermine isolation. Transient execution attacks like Meltdown and Spectre exposed deep flaws in x86 CPUs. RISC-V, by contrast, enters with the promise of simplicity and transparency—a clean slate. Yet the question remains: will we repeat the same mistakes, or can we design a secure architecture from the start?</p>\n<p>This talk takes a critical look at how RISC-V implementations handle microarchitectural security today. We show that even \"simple\" in-order designs already suffer from architectural flaws and powerful side channels. In our earlier work, we demonstrated novel attacks, such as Cache+Time and CycleDrift, on the first commercial RISC-V CPUs, exploiting unprivileged access to instruction-retirement counters and cache-timing leakage.</p>\n<p>But manual analysis does not scale. RISCover, our open-source differential fuzzing framework, automatically discovers architectural vulnerabilities across closed-source RISC-V CPUs. By comparing instruction behavior across 8 commercial CPUs from 3 vendors, RISCover found what manual analysis missed: GhostWrite, a bug in T-Head's XuanTie C910 that lets unprivileged code write directly to physical memory, completely bypassing virtual memory isolation. We also discovered multiple \"halt-and-catch-fire\" sequences that crash CPUs from userspace, leading to denial-of-service.</p>\n<p>These findings reveal a pattern: while the RISC-V specification provides strong security primitives (e.g., PMP and cleaner privilege separation), implementations consistently choose insecure defaults—leaving unprivileged timing sources enabled, shipping undocumented vendor extensions like XTheadVec without proper validation, and omitting features to limit speculation.\nRISC-V is at an inflection point: the architecture is still young enough to fix, but adoption is accelerating fast. The decisions vendors make today—insecure defaults, unvalidated extensions, missing mitigations—will be baked into billions of chips we cannot patch.</p>",

One reason we did this was to support more direct community participation in shaping and deciding the future of Mastodon. In the coming year, we’re also planning to increase our efforts with and on behalf of the communities we support and that surround us: from server admins to the broader social web and Fediverse. </p>\n<p>In this talk, Mastodon’s new Community Director Hannah Aubry will share the foundation’s plans for evolving how the project approaches its many communities, from server admins to the broader social web. Bear in mind this isn’t just a talk; it’s an invitation to co-create the future of Mastodon.</p>",

In an era of geopolitical fragmentation and relentless platform <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification\">enshittification</a></em>, we cannot afford to remain dependent on Big Tech gatekeepers for our digital voices. The Social Web offers an alternative—but only if we actively claim it.</p>\n<p>We'll show you how to establish genuine digital sovereignty by federating different content types across the Fediverse. Through live demos of Mastodon (microblogging), Pixelfed (images), and Castopod (podcasting), we'll demonstrate how these independent platforms seamlessly federate via ActivityPub—allowing you to own your content, control your audience relationships, and maintain your voice across media types without surrendering to corporate platforms.</p>\n<p><strong>What we'll do together:</strong>\n- <strong>Understand why now matters</strong>: We'll examine the geopolitical and economic forces driving platform consolidation and why decentralization is a democratic imperative\n- <strong>Break the enshittification trap</strong>: We'll show how platforms extract value by degrading service, and why federation breaks this cycle\n- <strong>See federation in action</strong>: We'll demo cross-platform federation live—posting from Castopod, watching interactions appear in Mastodon, building community across instances\n- <strong>Get you started</strong>: We'll give you concrete next steps to migrate your digital presence to the Social Web</p>\n<p>By the end of this session, you'll know exactly where to start. If you have a laptop, you can host a podcast on the Fediverse—and we'll show you how. The tools exist. The community is ready.

    "abstract": "<p>The German-European initiative Save Social proposes a 25 minutes session focused on broadening the involvement of society in the development and stewardship of the open social web. Despite immense progress in establishing open alternatives like Mastodon or Friendica, today's open social web has struggled to connect with and empower the wider public, often because structural support has concentrated on technical advancements rather than inclusive engagement and content diversity.\nA handful of global platform monopolies dominate – as we all know - public discourse and information, undermining democratic exchange and transparency. While open alternatives exist, their reach is limited without the structural, content, and educational investment needed to engage broader segments of society. Current alternatives have not always made participation intuitive or relevant for users from fields outside the technology sector, which limits their impact and hinders genuine diversity in dialogue and innovation.\nTherefore the future of the social web is not just a matter for developers, but for everyone—requiring regulatory support, media education, and the creation of citizen committees to define public-good requirements. The session will highlight specific, actionable pathways for different sectors to join the open web movement, making digital democracy a society-wide project rather than a niche initiative, e. g.:\n    • Frame the strategy around a clear democratic and social purpose, not only technical openness.\n    • Frame strategies around stories and lived experiences instead of only technical roadmaps.\n    • Treat communities as Co-desginers, move from “getting feedback” to “sharing authorship.”\n    • Assume most people are not protocol experts and design engagement accordingly.\n    • Build bridges to sectors of society\nSave Social's proposal is for a session that inspires and equips participants to break silos and bring the open social web to everyone, ensuring it serves as a democratic, accessible, and resilient foundation for the digital society of the future.\nSave Social is a network of 120 individuals, being supported by more that 260.000 signatories from Germany, collectively covering journalism, the arts, unions, startup founders, established economic leaders, public institutions, and research. This cross-sector representation is unique and powerful, fostering collaboration and a user-centric approach to digital democracy.</p>",

By developing a general-purpose client app, participating in the specification work, and addressing its shortcomings, we can initiate a new cycle of client app development. This approach will empower platform developers to innovate new services, fostering broader adoption and exploration of ActivityPub’s Federation capabilities across diverse platforms.</p>",

The opposite is true: Regulation gives the Fediverse a chance to compete with Big Tech. The lack of enforcement rewards the service providers who do not comply with the law. What the Fediverse needs is rather more legal certainty.</p>\n<p>This talk gives an overview about the legal pitfalls that service providers in the Fediverse are facing.

What goals and benefits could be achieved through such networks? They would enable regulatory influence and support, secure public funding, and help advocates to sit on public and non-public panels. This would enable them to raise awareness and advocate for decentralised social networks as a means of achieving digital sovereignty. </p>\n<p>One of our important political messages is to emphasize the importance of social networks as a fundamental building block in the pursuit of digital sovereignty in and for Europe. Social networks should also be recognized as a service that must be included in discussions about Eurostacks. </p>\n<p>To get those and other messages heard and repeated, we need more people to join these efforts.

Since its creation, Mastodon.uno has become one of the largest and most active Mastodon instances worldwide, and a central hub for the Italian-language Fediverse community. \nThe talk also presents some projects in development, focusing on FediPress, a WordPress plugin that enhances the official ActivityPub with a mobile-friendly, messenger-like PWA.</p>\n<p>Fedimedia Italia is a non-profit association promoting decentralized technologies, free software, and digital rights, aiming to build an ethical online ecosystem as an alternative to Big Tech platforms.

    "abstract": "<p>Public institutions are beginning to take an active role in the Fediverse, integrating ActivityPub platforms into their communication and identity ecosystems. This shift brings specific organisational challenges: introducing large and diverse user groups to decentralised networks, aligning institutional identity with the logic of the Social Web, establishing internal responsibilities, and ensuring that data protection and communication standards translate into federated environments.\nThis talk reflects on the experience of introducing a Mastodon instance at the University of Innsbruck, where more than 5,000 staff members can access the Fediverse through the university’s Single Sign-On system. The focus lies on the institutional layer of Fediverse adoption: designing onboarding procedures, coordinating collaboration between departments, developing moderation and communication guidelines, and embedding ActivityPub into established workflows.\nIn addition, the talk highlights what the Social Web ecosystem needs in order to better support institutional participation: more flexible onboarding paths, clearer role and permission models, moderation tools suited to organisational contexts and interfaces that help bridge institutional communication cultures with the norms of decentralised networks.\nThe aim is to outline how institutions can adopt ActivityPub at scale and contribute meaningfully to the Social Web, not only as operators of individual services, but as active partners in shaping open, federated digital spaces.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Civil organizations like libraries, schools, government agencies and NGO’s base their efforts on public values over financial profit. In their everyday operation however they often rely on tools that do not align with these public values: Big Tech platforms that sell user data as a commodity, suppress voices, increase polarization and undermine democracy and mental health. </p>\n<p>While alternative tools and platforms are available, public institutions are often reluctant to start using them. At PublicSpaces, www.publicspaces.net, we work with 40 of these larger public institutions like libraries, museums, broadcasters, local governments and health and education institutions. All these partners share a common goal: to communicate on platforms that align with their public mission and public values.</p>\n<p>Doing this as a single institution is often difficult. Institutions often lack the knowledge, the funds or the expertise to create and manage new platforms. By working together we hope to strengthen our efforts, share knowledge and create a common ecosystem. Some of the project we worked on were PeerTube Spaces, a pilot to set up video as a digital commons, the Make Social Social again campaign in which we help institutions to take the first step together by using alternatives to Big Tech social media platforms and the Fediverse Helpdesk we will start in 2026.</p>\n<p>While we know from conversation with or partners what the common bottlenecks and holdback towards adoption of alternative platforms are, we would like to underpin this knowledge with actual data. For this talk we will send out a survey to a representative section of our partners institutions about what the mayor issues are with the use of alternatives are. </p>\n<p>We will analyze and visualize this data, combine it with our experience in working with public institutions and  and present it in a developer friendly form. With this talk we hope to give insight into improvement the developer community can to help public institutions, and their clients,  users, citizens, etc. adopt alternative platforms. We will try to answer questions as:</p>\n<pre><code>• What hare the main holdbacks for civil institutions towards wider adoption of Fediverse tools?\n• What technical and other improvements would help civil institutions adopt Fediverse tools?\n• What types of support and knowledge sharing are needed?\n• What type of organization and governance are needed to support this?\n• How can the Fediverse community help civil institutions and how can civil institutions help the Fediverse community?\n</code></pre>",

    "abstract": "<p>A few years ago I volunteered at a non-profit where the go-to digital badge platform (e.g., Credly) was explicitly prohibited due to cost, vendor lock-in and rigid workflows. We needed a badge system for volunteer recognition, skill tracking and event participation — yet the high price and closed ecosystem killed it every time.</p>\n<p>This is how BadgeFed was born, an open-source, federated badge system built on the ActivityPub protocol and the Open Badges standard. Because it’s an instance you control, deployable in minutes, fully federated and self-hostable, it overcame the cost/lock-in barrier and unlocked recognition for our volunteer community. </p>\n<p>So how do we move digital badges out of locked-down platforms and into the federated social web? In this talk I’ll walk through how BadgeFed, an open-source credentialing system built on the ActivityPub protocol and aligned with the Open Badges spec, powers non-profits to issue, share and verify badges across Fediverse instances.</p>\n<p>I will share:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Why traditional badge systems are brittle and siloed, and how a decentralised model flips that dynamic. </li>\n<li>How BadgeFed implements ActivityPub actors, badge issuance as federated objects, and federated discovery. </li>\n<li>How Community Credentials uses the stack to empower nonprofits and volunteer programs: federated badges that survive issuer shutdowns, open standards, self-hostable instances, social graph integration. \ncommunitycredentials.org</li>\n<li>What remains challenging: federation scaling, discovery/search of badges across instances, identity portability, moderation/trust issues.</li>\n<li>Next steps for BadgeFed and federated credentials in the Social Web ecosystem, and how you as a dev or org can pick it up.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Attendees will leave with a clear understanding of how to deploy a federated badge service, integrate it with their tools, and contribute to a social-web native credentialing future..</p>\n<h2>Referentes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/tryvocalcat/badgefed\">Github repo</a></li>\n</ul>",

    "slug": "KSEUZT-fedify",
    "url": "https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/KSEUZT-fedify/",
    "abstract": "<p>Implementing ActivityPub looks simple at first—it's just JSON over HTTP, right? Then you hit JSON-LD context resolution. Then HTTP Signature verification fails on Mastodon but works on Misskey. Then you realize the spec spans hundreds of pages across W3C documents and <a href=\"https://w3id.org/fep/\">FEPs</a> (Fediverse Enhancement Proposals), and every implementation interprets them differently.</p>\n<p>I went through this pain building <a href=\"https://docs.hollo.social/\">Hollo</a>, a single-user microblogging server. Halfway through, I realized I was building a framework instead of an app. So I extracted that framework and called it Fedify.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://fedify.dev/\">Fedify</a> is an opinionated ActivityPub framework for TypeScript. It handles the protocol plumbing so you can focus on your application logic.</p>\n<p>In this talk, I'll cover:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><em>Type-safe vocabulary:</em> The Activity Vocabulary spec is loosely defined, but Fedify maps it to strict TypeScript types. Your IDE knows that <code>Note.content</code> is a <code>LanguageString</code>, and calling <code>await create.getActor()</code> returns an <code>Actor</code> object. No more guessing at property shapes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Comprehensive signature support:</em> Fedify implements four authentication mechanisms—HTTP Signatures (draft-cavage), HTTP Message Signatures (RFC 9421), Linked Data Signatures, and Object Integrity Proofs (FEP-8b32). For HTTP Signatures, it uses <a href=\"https://swicg.github.io/activitypub-http-signature/#how-to-upgrade-supported-versions\">double-knocking</a>: trying RFC 9421 first, falling back to draft-cavage if rejected, and remembering the preference. This kind of interoperability work is exactly what you shouldn't have to do yourself.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Framework-agnostic design:</em> Fedify works as middleware for Hono, Express, Fastify, Next.js, or any framework that speaks <code>Request</code>/<code>Response</code>. Bring your own database, ORM, and auth—Fedify only needs a key–value store for caching.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>CLI toolchain:</em> The <code>fedify inbox</code> command spins up an ephemeral server to receive and inspect activities. <code>fedify lookup</code> fetches any ActivityPub object by URL or fediverse handle—including from servers that require <a href=\"https://swicg.github.io/activitypub-http-signature/#authorized-fetch\">authorized fetch</a>. No need to create throwaway accounts on production instances.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I'll also share production stories: <a href=\"https://activitypub.ghost.org/day-4/\">Ghost chose Fedify</a> for federating their publishing platform rather than implementing the protocol themselves. Hollo demonstrates single-user microblogging with full Mastodon API compatibility. <a href=\"https://hackers.pub/\">Hackers' Pub</a> shows how a developer community can integrate with the fediverse.</p>\n<p>Whether you're building a new federated service or adding ActivityPub to an existing app, this talk will show you how Fedify turns months of protocol wrangling into days of actual development.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p><b>Digital public products need sustainable vehicles</b></p>\n<p>https://www.publiccode.net/public-product-organizations</p>\n<p>For almost 10 years, the Foundation for Public Code has been working with public administrations and their partners to better develop public digital infrastructure together.  Through many collaborations between cities., states, and other public institutions, we have come to realize that all projects that hope to become sustainable implementations in the context of the public sector would benefit from a well formed nonprofit vehicle that has a strong governance model, financial model, community practice, open license, and continuous integration process.  We have been working with multiple members state governments in the European Union, and with several in the European commission, on defining a legal form for a new type of NGO that we call the public product organization.  </p>\n<p>The PPO, a non-profit vehicle built specifically to develop and steward an open digital public asset [like a software product, dataset, content database, or machine learning model] would become the hub for collaborations among a constellation of public and private partners and establish a strong governance model, provide context and support for a community of practice, and maintain access to an array of developers who could take on specific work packages set out in a shared roadmap, or do bespoke implementations for specific local administrations.</p>\n<p>We believe that building the policy infrastructure to enable the easy creation of vehicles that allow for this type of collaboration will unlock an economy that thrives based on the contribution of a huge network of small software development studios across Europe.  By enabling the creation of an NGO subtype that is specifically qualified to serve as a steward of digital assets, we can de-risk institutional engagement with open source options in procurement, and begin to design sustainable funding mechanisms that support a newly flourishing ecosystem of digital public infrastructure.</p>\n<p>The Foundation for Public Code have served in the process of the creation of products, born from the pioneering work of teams in public administrations and their vendors, who have created some of the most celebrated digital public infrastructure in Europe.  In the past, we have called ourselves \"codebase doulas\", helping products move out of a development cycle funded by a single public institution, which leaves them vulnerable to political change and less capable of engaging with an array of partners at peer administrations.  Now we are helping guide projects toward realization as fully collaborative nonprofit stewardship vehicles.

    "abstract": "<p>Across Europe, institutions are seeking credible, sovereign, open alternatives to proprietary cloud platforms. France’s public digital agency, DINUM, took a bold step in that direction by developing La Suite, a fully open-source service stack. What is unique is not only the openness of the code, but the ambition: that a public administration can edit and publish digital commons for the public good.</p>\n<p>But building a commons is only the first step. Ensuring long-term adoption, usability, and sustainability requires an ecosystem. This is the role of LaSuite.coop, a SCIC (Société Coopérative d’Intérêt Collectif), which extends La Suite beyond the administration to local governments, universities, associations, cooperatives, and civil society. As a democratic, multi-stakeholder cooperative, LaSuite.coop enables users not just to access the tools, but to co-govern them — reclaiming strategic control over their digital environment.</p>\n<p>LaSuite.coop brings together several open-source service providers — Open Source Politics, Yaal, lebureau.coop, Galae— who mutualise development, DevOps, hosting, support, UX, and community engagement. This model funds open-source development sustainably without enclosure, venture capital, or extractive business models.</p>\n<p>This talk explores how La Suite and LaSuite.coop illustrate a public–private–commons partnership model:</p>\n<p>a public entity creating and guaranteeing the commons,</p>\n<p>a cooperative ecosystem maintaining and scaling it,</p>\n<p>a community steering its evolution,</p>\n<p>and a sustainable business model aligned with the public good.</p>\n<p>We believe this hybrid model offers a concrete blueprint for future European digital commons.</p>",

Our goal was not to “export” code, but to evaluate:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>how to co-develop open-source modules with other Member States,</li>\n<li>how to make reuse realistic across different administrative cultures</li>\n<li>and how to try to pool efforts and resources and leverage EU funding to support sustainability rather than siloted prototypes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2. What we tried (and what we learned)</strong></p>\n<p>This objective can be accomplished through the establishment of a European strategy for the funding and development of open source products led by member states</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Seek out other enthusiastic European partners capable of co-developing or utilizing open source digital products to increase the number of active users in the EU</li>\n<li>Pinpoint the most appropriate European funds for these topics to pool and leverage national investments</li>\n<li>Submit applications for relevant project calls with suitable partners</li>\n<li>Promote awareness within member states, particularly among product/project managers, about the opportunities to work with open source with European partners.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Use case 1 : The 100Days Challenge: iterative hackathons, real code</strong>\n<strong>Use case 2 : GovTech4All: 16 partners, 3 pilots, 3 sustainability challenges</strong></p>\n<p>We also see this talk as an opportunity to inform and connect with European partners across various administrations to encourage cooperation and lay the groundwork for future projects</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>While digital sovereignty is increasingly prompted on European and National levels, the urgency and risks implied have yet to reach the regional and local levels of government. Building robust public digital infrastructure and services on open source foundations have potential both in addressing risks while also providing a substantial economic up-side considering how public digital services are mirrored across regional and local borders. This talk shares insights from a cross-country, multiple-case study investigating how collaboration, sharing, and reuse among local governments are actively forging sovereignty from the ground up.</p>\n<p>Drawing on detailed examples—including democratic engagement platforms, public desktop solutions, open data infrastructure, parliamentary transparency tools, and national public transport systems —the session highlights governance models and practical mechanisms enabling local actors to translate policy ambitions into operational, interoperable, and sovereign public digital infrastructure. By foregrounding how municipal IT teams partner with foundations, non-profits, and each other, the presentation illustrates how public digital infrastructure that can be adapted and reused across borders, tailored to local needs yet scalable for European cooperation.</p>\n<p>Attendees will gain concrete recommendations for institutionalising open source in public service delivery, developing community capacity, and ensuring public values are embedded in digital infrastructure. The session advocates for bottom-up, collaborative approaches, demonstrating that digital sovereignty is not merely a national top-down project. Attendees, including policymakers, practitioners, and technologists eager to operationalise digital sovereignty at local and regional levels, will benefit from actionable narratives and strategies grounded in real, European experience.</p>\n<p>The full report with all case studies are openly available via OSOR: https://interoperable-europe.ec.europa.eu/collection/open-source-observatory-osor/news/multiple-case-study-public-sector-open-source</p>",

Flurfunk is a Proof of Concept wireless and wired network with a sizable number of human users with purely FOSS infrastructure: Routers, Switches, WiFi Access Points and a Certificate Authority, all of them running FOSS firmware, operating systems and services. This whole infrastructure is centrally orchestrated and requires almost zero maintenance.</p>\n<p>The magic lies in OpenWrt https://openwrt.org/ (for the network components) and Smallstep step-ca https://smallstep.com/open-source/ combined with OpenSSL https://www.openssl.org/ (for the CA), as well as Debian https://www.debian.org/ , Das U-Boot https://u-boot.org/ and coreboot https://www.coreboot.org/ (behind the scenes).</p>\n<p>Yes, the network supports the latest and greatest in authentication standards (WPA3 Enterprise), but it also offers user-friendly setup for users and admins. This includes automated certificate rollout to all centrally managed laptops and smartphones for WLAN access via WPA3 Enterprise. Yes, Flurfunk aims to be CRA compliant ahead of time.</p>\n<p>Yes, all components are current off-the-shelf hardware and yes, installing OpenWrt on them is easy (no tools needed).</p>\n<p>No, Flurfunk is not a production network nor does it come with support, it's a PoC.</p>\n<p>Do you want to stand on the shoulders of giants as we do, and replicate the setup for your own network? \nOf course the configuration files for all components as well as links to the relevant firmware/OS images will be provided for download.

Technology is often the easy part. The real challenge lies in transforming not just infrastructure, but mindsets, workflows, and institutional culture. True independence requires successfully leading organizational change - preparing teams, managing resistance, and building confidence in open source alternatives.</p>\n<p>This talk shares proven change management strategies from leading IT transformations and guiding public sector clients through transitions from Jira to OpenProject, demonstrating how to build sustainable and resilient digital ecosystems that serve citizens rather than vendors. You'll learn how to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Co-create change through proven leadership best practices</li>\n<li>Create ownership for the open source solutions within public sector</li>\n<li>Build the business case and frame the open source narrative that resonates with public sector stakeholders and decision-makers</li>\n<li>Drive the mindset shift to FOSS</li>\n<li>Identify your use cases and foster transition to open source products</li>\n<li>Build internal champions who drive adoption across departments</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Drawing from real-world public sector experiences and Rosanna Sibora's experience in driving IT transformations, this session reveals the human factors that make or break digital sovereignty initiatives.

In this talk, we present the TAPPaaS blueprint and show how we combine existing FOSS building blocks into a sovereign, standards‑based stack that can be operated by SMBs, NGOs and local governments with limited resources. We highlight how automation and common patterns reduce operational effort, improve security and resilience, and avoid lock‑in to proprietary hyperscalers.</p>\n<p>TAPPaaS is work in progress, so we share what already works well in pilots and prototypes, where we still hit hard problems, and which trade‑offs we made along the way. Attendees will leave with a concrete blueprint for running a sovereign PaaS with a small team.

The home automation system manages short-term control. Together, they combine strategic planning with real-time execution, delivering the best of both worlds in home energy management.</p>\n<p>Common applications include optimizing consumption under dynamic electricity tariffs, ensuring cost-efficient EV charging, shifting flexible loads to cheaper periods, and connecting seamlessly with systems such as Home Assistant or NodeRED.</p>\n<p>EOS stands out through its genetic algorithm, enabling optimization of any behavior that can be simulated—without the limitations of linear or convex models. Non-linear battery degradation, grid-stress signals, comfort models, or heat pumps with non-linear COP fields can be used directly, without artificial simplification. This makes EOS highly modular and flexible, allowing new components or physical models to be added and immediately included in the optimization.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Optimally planning the energy flows across multiple sites becomes more important, e.g. for orchestrating the aggregated flows due to grid congestion, or for implementing energy sharing. This approach can break bottlenecks and increase savings - as such, energy communities are an important topic for the European Commission.</p>\n<p>In this talk, we present our ongoing work towards a Community Energy Management System (CEMS) with FlexMeasures. We discuss our architectural approach: optimizing the flows for each sites by themselves and then adding an orchestration layer on top. This approach is being tested in a project with TNO in the Netherlands. The goal is to manage neighbourhoods as well as commercial sites optimally.</p>\n<p>In addition, we want to discuss how scalable any CEMS system can be, as many circumstances and conditions often vary, per site and per energy community. We chose our CEMS architecture approach for this reason, but versatility has been a design principle for FlexMeasures since the beginning. In this talk, we will showcase a complete example script of a setup orchestrating a few homes. This script is written with the FlexMeasures client and is also open source. FlexMeasures being 100% scriptable is a design choice that lets many developers built just what they need in energy intelligence.</p>\n<p>This is also an opportunity to visit some fundamental improvements we have made in the last year in the documentation of FlexMeasures and its flexibility options - both for developers and users.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Solar energy is predicted to be the largest form of power generation globally by 2040 and having accurate forecasts is critical to balancing the grid. Unlike fossil fuels, renewable energy resources are unpredictable in terms of power generation from one hour to the next. In order to balance the grid, operators need a close estimate of when and how much solar and wind power will be generated on a given day. </p>\n<p>Open Climate Fix (an open source AI company) developed and deployed PVNet, a large ML model which forecasts solar generation for the next 36 hours. The forecasts are used by the UK electricity grid operator for real-time decision making and for reserve planning. These forecasts can save 300,000 tonnes of CO₂ and £30 million per year. </p>\n<p>But how do we have a global impact? We decided to build a lightweight solar forecast that works anywhere in the world, which we showcased last year at FOSDEM. Combining this with every country's solar capacity, we are able to produce a solar forecast for every country in the world. In this talk, we'll demo our Global Forecast and discuss how this forecast can support grid transition as well as open-source renewable energy projects all over the globe. </p>\n<p>Open Climate Fix is an open-source not for profit company using machine learning (ML) to respond to the need for accurate renewable energy forecasts. Connecting energy industry practitioners with ML researchers doing cutting-edge energy modelling is our aim, and one way we seek to do this is by making much of our code open-source.</p>",

This session explains why a full stack of tools, testing methods, and feedback loops is essential for true interoperability, and how the open-source EVerest ecosystem has become a practical integration point for these technologies. We will show how Software-in-the-Loop testing, Golden SUT validation, conformance tooling, virtual charger parks, testing-hackathons, and cloud-based remote debugging work together to close the gap between specification and reality. The talk demonstrates how open-source reference implementations can strengthen standards, improve certification tools, and reduce interoperability pain across the EV charging industry.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>In this talk, we introduce <strong>µSolarVerter</strong>, our open-hardware micro-inverter designed to support decentralised solar production while giving users full control over the information their system generates. The project grew from a simple question: <em>how do we make small-scale solar both understandable and adaptable, without locking people into a black box</em>?</p>\n<p>Our presentation will be split into three parts: </p>\n<h3>1. Design Journey — focusing on what people actually use</h3>\n<p>We’ll walk through the design process by following the things users interact with most: <strong>clear and accessible data</strong>, <strong>a flexible software layer</strong>, and a <strong>hardware platform</strong> that supports both without getting in the way. The story is about enabling insight and experimentation: good telemetry, open interfaces, and a control system that stays transparent, all backed by a converter designed to be efficient, safe and repairable without requiring deep power-electronics expertise. Hardware is there, but it’s not the centrepiece — it’s the foundation beneath a system meant to be explored, extended and trusted.</p>\n<h3>2. Deliverables — µSolarVerter as a platform</h3>\n<p>We'll show you how we made <strong>µSolarVerter as a platform</strong>, built with the intention of gathering a community around it. We will unveil our <em>open documentation, open firmware and open data flows</em>, making it easy to integrate with domotics systems like Home Assistant or openHAB, or to build your own dashboards and analysis tools. Users can experiment with their own production/load-matching logic, develop new applications, or simply keep their data fully local. The openness is practical: it’s there to be used, not just admired.</p>\n<h3>3. Invitation — unveiling the beta program</h3>\n<p>We will introduce our <strong>OwnTech beta program</strong>, inviting participants who want early access to the platform, to test it, review it, or contribute improvements. Whether you are interested in decentralised energy, open design, or taking a more active role in your own solar production, this is a chance to get involved from the start and help shape where the project goes next.</p>\n<h3>More information</h3>\n<p>Project's repository: https://github.com/owntech-foundation/micro-inverter\nOwnTech's Forum: https://forum.owntech.org/\nOwnTech's documentation center: https://docs.owntech.org/latest/</p>",

As the system evolved, the effort required for each refactor decreased, highlighting an organic, evolutionary structure shaped by practical needs and use cases. </p>\n<p>I will discuss the challenges and insights gained during this evolution, focusing on how we integrated static network models, time-series data, transient analysis, and long-term planning. Additionally, I will cover how we overcame the challenges of multi-binary pitfalls and ensured seamless interaction between these diverse functionalities.</p>\n<p>This session will provide an overview of how these continuous improvements have produced an open-source tool that bridges the gap between research, operational applications, and long-term infrastructure planning.\nSee: https://github.com/SanPen/VeraGrid</p>",

It is made for researchers, planners and utilities with basic coding aptitude who need a fast, easy-to-use and transparent tool for power and energy system analysis.</p>\n<p>The first public version was released in 2016 and has since gained many users and contributors from around the world, becoming one of the most <a href=\"https://docs.pypsa.org/latest/home/users/\">widely used</a> energy system modeling tools. In October 2025, <a href=\"https://docs.pypsa.org/latest/user-guide/v1-guide/\">version 1.0</a> was released, which now enables modeling under uncertainty with a two-stage stochastic programming framework. This allows for more realistic decision making by accounting for multiple possible futures with uncertain renewable generation, demand, and prices, rather than optimizing for a single expected scenario.</p>\n<p>The talk will give a general overview of PyPSA and showcase the new stochastic programming functionality by solving an energy system planning problem under uncertainty. It is suitable for both experienced PyPSA users and newcomers to energy system modeling.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Energy systems are undergoing rapid transformation as sector coupling intensifies and variable renewable generation grows, creating a pressing need for flexible and transparent modeling tools. While many open-source frameworks offer rich features, extending them with new mathematical models typically requires writing custom software—a barrier for many analysts.</p>\n<p>We present GEMS (Generic Energy Systems Modelling Scheme), a  high-level modelling language designed to make multi-energy system adequacy and planning studies both more expressive and more accessible. GEMS brings model definitions out of the codebase and into simple YAML configuration files, where users describe variables, parameters, and constraints using natural mathematical expressions. These expressions are parsed into abstract syntax trees and automatically expanded—across time structures, scenario trees, and study data—into a complete optimization problem. This model-agnostic architecture enables rapid experimentation, lowers development and maintenance costs, and promotes true reusability: adding a new component requires no code, only data. The language is already supported in Antares Simulator and in the Python package GemsPy.</p>\n<p>We present how GEMS could paves the way for interoperability between modelling tools, offering a neutral and extensible modeling layer that can be shared across the open-source energy modeling ecosystem.</p>",

We’ll examine how open source observability ecosystems are beginning to address carbon awareness and promote more efficient data practices. Through examples, I’ll show how teams can reduce ingestion volume, lower storage requirements, improve performance and enhance reliability through green coding practices.\nBy linking observability design choices to the Green Software Foundation’s principles, attendees will see how green observability supports a broader sustainable software strategy. They’ll also learn why sustainability in observability isn’t just an organizational obligation, it's a responsibility each engineer carries in the way we collect, store, and interpret data.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>E-Paper technology is often highlighted for its reflective readability and near-zero static power consumption, making it an attractive choice in a world where digital displays are becoming increasingly ubiquitous. From public transport signage to smart meters and IoT devices, the number of deployed displays continues to grow—and with it, the cumulative energy they consume. A sustainable future does not require removing or avoiding displays, but rather designing and driving them intelligently.</p>\n<p>If you work with E-Paper displays, you will inevitably encounter a situation where the manufacturer provides only partially documented driver code—or, in many cases, a binary blob packed with initialization parameters and so-called waveform lookup tables (LUTs). Experimenting with these values often leads to unwanted side effects such as ghosting, low contrast, long-term image retention, or even permanently damaged panels. A solid understanding of the physics behind E-Paper driving is essential for safely modifying LUTs and optimizing them for lower active energy usage through improved waveform design and voltage-generation strategies.\nIn this talk, we break down the electrical and algorithmic principles that govern E-Paper operation and show how waveform LUTs influence update speed, ghosting behavior, image quality, and—critically—energy consumption.</p>\n<p>Key Takeaways</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Understand why display energy matters in a world with rapidly increasing numbers of screens—and how E-Paper fits into a sustainable future.</li>\n<li>Learn the physical and algorithmic principles behind E-Paper waveform driving and how LUTs impact image quality, speed, ghosting, and energy use.</li>\n<li>Discover optimization techniques for lowering refresh energy through waveform tuning, voltage management, and timing control.</li>\n<li>See measurement-based comparisons showing how open, community-driven waveform development can outperform standard vendor LUTs in both quality and efficiency.</li>\n</ul>",

    "abstract": "<p>EV charging stations expose a uniquely difficult CRA landscape: A single physical device can be accessed through very different user paths: ISO 15118 (Plug&amp;Charge), RFID cards, mobile apps, credit-card terminals, and OEM-backends. Between the end user and the actual product manufacturer sit multiple intermediaries (CSMS, OEM cloud, roaming hubs, payment processors), each with partial control over configuration, telemetry, and security posture. How to deliver all the CRA obligations across this complex eco system? At the same time a typical Charging Station Operator (CPO) has to manage over 300 different manufactures, models, firmware images and cyber security might differ from monitored private charging stations up to high-power public charging stations.</p>\n<p>Rather on relying on \"out-of-band\" CRA management, a better approach might be to integrate all CRA cyber security obligations and especially the vulnerability management deeply into the commonly used management protocols like the Open Charge Point Protocol (OCPP). This removes the disconnect between CRA compliance work and operational reality.</p>\n<p>Work in the Open Charge Alliance (notably the Cyber Security Task Group), CyberStand.eu’s CRA alignment efforts, and the newly NLnet NGI Zero Commons–funded <strong>EVQI</strong> project is already pushing concrete interfaces in this direction: Device-model variables for CRA readiness, structured vulnerability and lifecycle metadata, cross-vendor health monitoring, and standardized audit-trail exports suitable for CRA Article 10-15 reporting.</p>\n<p>This session outlines how CRA obligations can be realized in a heterogeneous, multi-vendor charging ecosystem with an emphasis on operators managing 50000+ of devices. It shows which processes must be automated, which artefacts need to be transported over OCPP, and how deep protocol-level integration enables consistent, scalable CRA compliance across an extremely diverse EV-charging landscape.</p>",

This session is designed for community managers, project maintainers, stewards, and open source contributors interested in practical CRA readiness. The focus is on practical enablement by Community Managers, exploring how they can support compliance without assuming legal liability. </p>\n<p>We’ll show how Community Managers can:\n- Communicate CRA-relevant processes to contributors, downstream adopters, and vendors\n- Structure documentation, governance pages, and onboarding materials for clarity and discoverability\n- Protect newcomers from unnecessary compliance burden, keeping contribution welcoming and accessible\n- Support maintainers, triaging non-technical questions, coordinating workflows, and preventing burnout\nFacilitate cross-project collaboration, shared tooling, and evidence collection practices\n- Manage vulnerability communication to maintain trust and transparency</p>\n<p>The objective is for attendees to leave with practical strategies, templates, and examples that make CRA compliance manageable while keeping open source communities healthy and contributor-friendly. This session is ideal for community managers, project stewards, maintainers, and anyone interested in the human side of CRA readiness in FOSS projects. Attendees will leave with key takeaways:\n- Understand CRA’s indirect impact on community management and a checklist of how tos\n- Learn concrete ways to keep projects welcoming despite increased compliance expectations\n- Explore templates and workflow ideas that reduce friction for contributors and maintainers alike\n- See examples of cross-project coordination and documentation practices that support CRA readiness</p>\n<p>This session emphasizes practical, community-driven solutions focusing on doing and not debating legal strategy making CRA compliance achievable and sustainable for FOSS communities.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>The implementation of the EU Cyber Resilience Act is currently shaped by two flawed assumptions: that most open source projects have a steward, and that stewards are synonymous with foundations. Data from the JavaScript and Rust ecosystems shows the opposite—hundreds of thousands of widely used packages exist outside any stewardship structure, while foundations oversee only a tiny fraction. The CRA anticipated this reality and introduced a separate mechanism to help manufacturers meet due-diligence requirements: a security attestation program intended to function as an open-source analogue to CE marking. Done well, attestations can dramatically simplify compliance while improving security and sustainability across the ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Current proposals, however, lean toward lightweight models that offer limited value to manufacturers and little support for the maintainers who produce the software those manufacturers rely on. This talk proposes a more effective middle path: an attestation approach that leverages maintainer expertise, delivers clear and actionable assurances to manufacturers, and creates sustainable revenue channels for projects.</p>\n<p>Using the OpenJS Foundation’s Ecosystem Sustainability Program (ESP) as a concrete example, we will illustrate how project-approved commercial support, revenue sharing, and clear integration points can produce benefits for both manufacturers and maintainers. ESP demonstrates how a structured program can help fund essential security and maintenance work without requiring projects to become foundation-stewarded. By connecting these lessons to the CRA’s attestation framework, the session outlines what a truly useful attestation system could deliver: practical compliance for manufacturers, meaningful support for maintainers, and a healthier, more resilient open source ecosystem.</p>",

We'll show real-world examples from major package ecosystems: Python packages with wrong license declarations, Java JARs with embedded vulnerable dependencies that scanners miss, Rust crates with incomplete origin metadata. When demonstrating due diligence or attempting automated vulnerability reporting, the underlying data failures make compliance impossible, no matter how good your tools are.</p>\n<p>The good news is that this is solvable, and the FOSS community is already working on it! </p>\n<p>We'll present concrete approaches being deployed across ecosystems: systematic metadata curation projects that scan and fix package data at scale, validation tooling that catches errors before publication, and community infrastructure that makes accurate software metadata freely available. You'll see how projects like Maven Heaven, T-Rust, and Nixpkgs Clarity are cleaning up metadata for the most popular packages, releasing curated data under open licenses, and providing author-facing tools to prevent bad data from entering registries. And we'll discuss how reliable project health data provides critical insights for proactive CRA due diligence and risk management.</p>\n<p>This session gives you practical next steps: how to audit data quality in your dependencies, contribute to metadata curation efforts, integrate validation into your publishing workflow, and leverage community-curated data for more reliable compliance automation.</p>",

By leveraging the prestart hook, we can gain access to the container’s initial PID, allowing an eBPF program to trace all file opens. Tracepoint and LSM (Linux Security Module) eBPF programs are combined to capture the absolute path of each opened file.</p>\n<p>In this presentation, we will show how this approach can allow us to distinguish required files from bloat, validate dependencies, and reduce container image size, resulting in smaller, faster, and more secure OCI images.</p>",

These extensible capabilities have become key launching points for innovation created and even maintained outside of the core project. We’ll look at the details of our snapshotter and shim interfaces, two popular ways to extend containerd that have many examples after 10 years of project development. New features will be demonstrated that utilize these interfaces such as native macOS support that uses the brand new \"nerdbox\" shim and the erofs snapshotter.</p>\n<p>We'll detail the concrete value provided by extensibility and invite other project creators and maintainers to consider how they are designing for extensibility to enable innovation.</p>",

However, this is far from a container-specific issue. Many Unix programs have historically suffered from similar issues, and the various attempts at resolving it have not really measured up.</p>\n<p>This talk will go through the myriad of issues necessary to protect user space programs against these kinds of attacks, completed and ongoing kernel work to try to make these problems easier to resolve, and our experience migrating a container runtime's codebase to a design which emphasises path-safety. In addition, this talk will also include an update on <a href=\"https://github.com/cyphar/libpathrs\">libpathrs</a> (a library intended to make mitigating these attacks much easier for most Linux programs).</p>",

It has evolved quite a bit since our initial talk at FOSDEM 2017. We progressively changed many of the tools and software we have been using, for instance, transitionning from Docker Compose to kubernetes. In more recent time, we are progressively using Nix and NixOS in various part of our work. In this talk, we wish to show what this change actually looks like in our processes.</p>\n<p>As a demonstration, we are gonna deploy an instance of LaSuite.coop, a fully-fledged application suite, starting from a fresh environment. Along the way we'll cover how our provisionning is done with nixos-anywhere and disko, how declarative Nix environments impacted our workflow, how we build reproducible container images using Nix, and more. Basically, if it uses Nix at IndieHosters, we will discuss it!

    "abstract": "<p>Our digital lives are increasingly fragmented across numerous centralised online services. This model concentrates power, leaving us with minimal technical control over our personal data and online identities. The long-term permanence of these platforms is uncertain, and their commercial incentives are often misaligned with user interests. We propose inverting this model: instead of centralising our data in proprietary silos, let’s centralise our presence under our own control using open, federated services. We introduce the concept of ‘digital islands’, or Eileans – self-hosted hubs for an individual’s or community’s online presence. By hosting services ourselves, we regain autonomy and control. Eilean is a project designed to simplify the creation and management of these digital islands. The core idea is to parameterise a complete operating system deployment by a domain name and a desired set of services. This allows users to easily deploy their own instances of federated services like Matrix, Mastodon, and E-Mail. We utilise NixOS to enable declarative, reproducible configuration and deployment of these services. This provides strong guarantees about the system’s state.</p>\n<p>https://github.com/RyanGibb/eilean-nix</p>",

All changes go through GitOps workflows, and services are packaged as NixOS modules that share central identity, secrets, backup and monitoring. We will show the architecture, NixOS/Flake deployment structure and CI/CD pipeline, and how declarative configuration helps with upgrades, failures and restores.\nThis talk is for Nix/NixOS users and operators who want to turn homelab ideas into robust platforms for real organisations. We will share what works and where we struggle, and invite experienced nixers to challenge our choices and point us to patterns and tools we should adopt.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Reproducibility remains one of the largest challenges in benchmarking distributed systems, especially when hardware, kernel settings, and dependency versions vary between tests. This talk presents a NixOS-based approach for constructing deterministic, portable benchmark environments for large-scale data infrastructure. We show how Nix’s declarative system configuration, content-addressed builds, and reproducible packaging model allow engineers to isolate performance variables and eliminate configuration drift entirely. Using Apache Cassandra as the primary case study, the talk demonstrates how NixOS can define and reproduce complete cluster environments—from OS images to JVM parameters and custom benchmarking tools—across both cloud and on-prem setups. Attendees will learn practical patterns for packaging workloads, pinning dependencies, and generating ephemeral benchmark nodes. The session concludes with a discussion of how Nix abstractions can support multi-architecture testing, including cross-compiling workloads for ARM and RISC targets, enabling more transparent and repeatable performance comparisons.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Have you ever felt the need for a virtual machine in your NixOS server environment? Maybe the functionality you want is not available in NixOS? Maybe there’s a custom OS image for a service you want to provide? Maybe you just want to securely isolate your workload? NixOS promises reproducible and declarative systems, but for VMs it just wasn’t there yet. To close this gap we built the <code>ctrl-os.vms</code> NixOS module, a solution to define generic virtual machines directly in your NixOS configuration. It works just like <code>virtualisation.oci-containers</code>, but for VMs instead of containers. 20 lines of Nix make it possible to run any Linux distribution you want as a VM on your NixOS host. To put a cherry on top you can use <code>cloud-init</code>, from our NixOS configuration to configure your guests declaratively, too!\n<code>ctrl-os.vms</code> is part of the <a href=\"https://github.com/cyberus-ctrl-os/ctrl-os-modules\">ctrl-os-modules</a> repository.</p>",

But there's a problem: Nix packages' license metadata is a mess. </p>\n<p>Nix's license tracking uses a custom license ID system that doesn't match the best practice of using SPDX license expressions standards, inconsistently referencing SPDX or ScanCode LicenseDB. The metadata often falls out of sync with the actual code or misrepresents what's really licensed, and packagers typically only check the top-level declared license and skip the file-level details where the real complexity hides. For an ecosystem built on correctness and reproducibility, this is a gap we need to close.</p>\n<p>Nixpkgs Clarity fixes this with state-of-the-art automated license detection. We're correcting and standardizing license metadata across the entire Nixpkgs collection, aligning with SPDX best practices, and making sure what we declare actually matches what's in the code. This matters because accurate license data is critical for software supply chain security, CRA compliance, and anyone who needs to responsibly reuse Nixpkgs packages in production.</p>\n<p>This talk shows how we're detecting and correcting license metadata across Nixpkgs, and what changes when you finally have accurate license data. We'll share how we are tackling the unique challenges of Nixpkgs at scale, with tens of thousands of packages, Nix's functional approach to package definitions, and automated detection in a way that maintainers can trust and verify. </p>\n<p>If you care about making Nixpkgs even more reliable and supply chain ready, come see how we're bringing Nix's correctness principles to Nix packages' license metadata.</p>",

We’ll look at how free-threading affects real workloads through concrete benchmarks. We'll investigate the often overlooked effect of freethreading on webservers. You’ll see how modern servers like Granian, ASGI frameworks, and WSGI stacks behave when threads are no longer serialized by the interpreter.</p>\n<p>By the end, you’ll understand not only what the GIL is, but what its disappearance means for scaling Python applications in production. Whether you're building high-throughput APIs, tuning async code, or planning future architecture, free-threaded Python opens the door to new performance ceilings - along with new tradeoffs every developer should know.</p>",

Real Python. With loops that don’t require learning a DSL. With functions that are... wait for it... actual functions. With error handling that doesn’t involve praying to the YAML gods and sacrificing a virgin bracket.</p>\n<p>In this talk, you’ll see how to:\n- Write infrastructure automation that your IDE actually understands\n- Debug with real stack traces instead of <code>\"ERROR: The task includes an option with an undefined variable\"</code>\n- Use actual Python conditionals instead of <code>when: ansible_os_family == \"Debian\" and not (ansible_distribution == \"Ubuntu\" and ansible_distribution_version is version('20.04', '&gt;='))</code>\n- Import and reuse code like a civilized developer, not copy-paste playbooks like it’s 1999\n- Test your infrastructure code with <code>pytest</code>, not <em>\"let’s run it in staging and see what breaks\"</em></p>\n<p>We’ll explore how a typical Ansible playbook can be transformed into clean, maintainable Python with PyInfra, shrinking from 500 lines of YAML to 50 lines of readable code. You’ll discover the joy of list comprehensions over <code>with_items</code>, and the power of deployment logic that can actually <em>think</em>.</p>\n<p>Stop treating your infrastructure like a configuration file. It’s 2026—your servers deserve better than YAML. They deserve Python.</p>\n<p><strong>Warning:</strong> This talk may cause uncontrollable urges to refactor all your Ansible playbooks.

More modern approaches based on data lakes, swap the T and L, since transformation is more efficiently done in a database system, especially when it comes to large volumes of data.</p>\n<p>In order to make all this work, the usual approach is to have a workflow system, taking care of managing all the intermediate steps, a large data lake database and distributed storage systems. This results in lots of complexity, need for system/cluster administration and maintenance.</p>\n<p>Now, with today's computers, most data sizes used in ETL no longer need all this complexity. Even notebooks or single VMs can handle the load, when used with external object storage, so all you really just need is the right software stack to manage your ETL - without all the overhead:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Python</strong> has grown to be the number one programming language on the planet and is especially well suited for integration work due to its many readily available connectors to plenty of backend systems. It often comes preinstalled on Linux machines and is easy to install on most other systems.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>DuckDB</strong> has emerged as one of the most capable embedded OLAP database systems and supports data lakes with the DuckLake extension, right out of the box. Installation is just a <code>uv add duckdb</code> away.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Both can be run on the same machine and are very resource friendly.</p>\n<p>The talk will give an overview of the typical steps involved in ETL processes, give a short intro to DuckDB and showcase how DuckDB can be put to good use when implementing ETL processes. If time permits, I can also cover a few advanced topics addressing optimization strategies.</p>\n<p><em>Resources:</em>\n- <a href=\"https://www.python.org/\">Python.org</a>\n- <a href=\"https://duckdb.org/\">DuckDB – An in-process SQL OLAP database management system</a></p>",

In this talk, I will explain how to run ROS 2 on non-standard platforms using Apptainer, a practical alternative to Docker. I explain why Apptainer works well for robotics: it enables easy access to USB and serial devices, supports GPUs, and runs GUI programs like rviz without configuration. The talk ends with a short look at when the package manager Pixi might even let you avoid containers altogether. Being less tied to a specific Ubuntu release makes robot development more flexible.</p>",

    "url": "https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/3SFYWM-hacking-cyber-physical_systems-with-ros2/",
    "abstract": "<p>The learning curve for ROS2 can be steep, often requiring the installation and resolution of diverse software dependencies across operating systems, sensors, network configurations and robotic platforms. By combining virtual machines (VMs), with their off-the-shelf, ready-to-use environments resources and modern container registry workflows, we can reduce this complexity and enables learners to focus more directly on developing ROS2 skills. This approach also offers a smoother onboarding process for participants with varying levels of technical experience. In this talk, we share hands-on insights from our hackathon, which explored a distributed setup involving two servers located in different University College London (UCL) departments --Advanced Research Computing (ARC) and Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering (CEGE)-- connected via a Zero Overhead Network Protocol (Zenoh) router with 10 GbE connectivity. One server from CEGE was connected to physical sensors --laser scanners, Inertial Measurement Units, and cameras-- with data streamed through the ROSBridge suite and Zenoh. On the ARC server and platforms (unified-AI and condenser), participants worked with off-the-shelf VMs and within containerised environments running ROS 2 Humble on Ubuntu 22.04. Five to ten participants accessed live sensor data via the ROSBridge Suite to visualise streams, perform object recognition and segmentation, and analyse outputs. They experimented with network constraints by varying sample rates, data types, and file sizes, and explored the trade-off between CPU usage for core ROS 2 packages and GPU demands for intensive tasks. Lessons on containerisation for virtual machines, managing dependencies, understanding latency and bandwidth, balancing resources, and cost considerations were shared, alongside next steps and a call for collaboration to advance ROS 2 skills and infrastructure in academia. </p>\n<p>See the link to our hackathon for further details, the discussion forum, and ways to get involved: https://github.com/UCL-CyberPhysicalSystems/hackathon-01</p>",

We will compare model-based and AI-driven approaches to implement new behaviors on Upkies, discussing what has worked and not worked so far, as well as future plans for the project like integrating vision for perceptive locomotion.</p>\n<p>On the hardware side, we will describe how Upkies use mjbots actuators and PCB cards, which are fully open source (down to motor-driver firmware and KiCad electronics files!). Upkies can be built from off-the-shelf components for around $3,000, making experimentation with bipedal robots more accessible to hobbyists and educators. We will finally conclude by releasing version 2 of the robot hardware with an on-stage demonstration.</p>",

It is written in Rust, with additional bindings for C, C++, Python, and C#, and runs on a variety of operating systems. iceoryx2 is already used in robotics, automotive, medical, finance, and other domains where high-throughput and low-latency communication are critical.</p>\n<p>We will walk through common middleware pain points in robotic systems and show how iceoryx2’s architecture and feature set help eliminate or significantly reduce them.</p>",

We walk through a complete precision landing pipeline using PX4, ROS 2, OpenCV, Aruco markers, and Gazebo, built the same way we teach it in our hands on workshops.</p>\n<p>We start with the pieces of the PX4 architecture that matter to you as a ROS developer, then show how the PX4 ROS 2 interface works, including the PX4 ROS 2 Library by Auterion that makes message handling feel familiar instead of foreign. From there we jump into simulation with Gazebo, run OpenCV based Aruco detection, and wire it all into a precision landing controller.</p>\n<p>The heart of the session is practical. We take the tag pose produced by OpenCV in the camera optical frame, transform it into the body frame and world frame, and use it to run an approach phase with PI velocity control. We cover the spiral search pattern for when the tag is not visible, and the land detection feedback that lets the system finish the job safely.</p>\n<p>To make it easy to try everything at home, we will provide a Docker container and an open repository with all the source code and configuration you need to reproduce the pipeline on your own machine.</p>\n<p>If you have ever thought about connecting your ROS and OpenCV skills to PX4 but did not know where to start, this talk will get you there with a smile and a working example you can take home.</p>",

It by default simulates real world imperfections such as dead time and acceleration limits, comes with six vehicle types (four bicycle/Ackermann + differential + omni/mecanum) and is fully configured through a minimum of ROS parameters.

The project is motivated by the limitations of existing systems, which are tightly coupled to a single environment representation and often introduce unnecessary computational overhead. EasyNav decouples navigation from the underlying map structure, enabling costmaps, gridmaps, NavMap, or other models to be used interchangeably. Its architecture is built around a minimal core and open, extensible stacks that group controllers, planners, localizers, and map managers. The framework is designed to be easy to inspect, modify, and extend through its clear plugin interfaces.

    "abstract": "<p><a href=\"https://github.com/autoapms/auto-apms\">AutoAPMS</a> is a heavily extensible development framework for behavior-based ROS 2 applications. It provides a highly modular integration of behavior trees, implements a powerful execution engine and offers convenient CLI tooling for deploying behaviors with ease.</p>\n<p>The intention of this project is to make it significantly more user-friendly and less error prone to develop autonomous robotics with behavior trees. The core packages are written in C++ and a supplementary Python API exposes high-level features for scripting.</p>\n<p>The framework relies on the popular BehaviorTree.CPP library under the hood and offers a Nav2-agnostic approach for using it within the ROS 2 ecosystem. It was inspired by BehaviorTree.ROS2 and can be considered a spiritual successor. AutoAPMS took the core ideas of the behavior tree paradigm and supercharged it with the following features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Integrated resource management using <code>ament_cmake</code> and <code>ament_index</code></li>\n<li>Modular design for multi-package workspaces</li>\n<li>Flexible and highly configurable behavior execution engine</li>\n<li>Powerful C++ behavior tree builder API (a supplement to BehaviorTree.CPP for enabling automated planning)</li>\n<li>Easy addition of custom behavior tree nodes with almost no boilerplate code required</li>\n<li>Support for custom behavior definitions and tree builder algorithms</li>\n<li><code>ros2cli</code> extension for working with the system directly from the command line</li>\n<li>User guide and API documentation</li>\n</ul>",

The mystery deepened when three different TPC-C benchmarks each told a conflicting story about MySQL’s speed.</p>\n<p>This talk details the systematic investigation to resolve these contradictions and reclaim the lost performance. We’ll walk through the methodical process of isolating variables across the entire software stack, dissecting benchmark implementations, profiling execution end-to-end with advanced tools, analyzing client/server protocol behavior, and comparing query optimization plans.</p>\n<p>The investigation revealed that the performance gap was not caused by a single flaw, but by a cascade of inefficiencies, in multiple areas of the stack. Subtle issues in query planning, protocol handling, and client-side implementation conspired to create overwhelming overhead. By addressing these interconnected problems holistically – through optimizer fixes, protocol enhancements, and client improvements – we transformed MySQL’s performance profile to reveal the engine’s true potential.</p>\n<p>The outcome was a dramatic turnaround: with additional improvements the performance of the new engine on MySQL reaches almost 2 million tpmC now. </p>\n<p>This case study underscores a critical lesson: database performance, for OLTP workloads in particular, is determined not by any single component, but by the precise alignment of the entire database stack, from the client down to the storage engine.</p>",

The in-process component has sometimes been viewed as a limitation when considering DuckDB as a data warehouse.</p>\n<p>However, DuckDB now supports reading and writing to most Open Table Formats (OTFs), including Iceberg, Delta, and DuckLake. This capability puts DuckDB in a very different position: it allows DuckDB to act as a SQL engine in the cloud (or on your local machine) and run queries against any OTF stored in remote cloud storage. DuckDB can now be the all-mighty, single-node query engine that powers your data analytics use cases.</p>\n<p>In this talk I will also dive into:\n- Why this change allows for a \"multi-player\" DuckDB experience.\n- How DuckDB efficiently queries very large tables leveraging table statistics and cache.\n- Why building native implementations with minimal dependencies to interact with OTFs is hard but can potentially pay off.</p>\n<p>Projects:\nhttps://github.com/duckdb/duckdb\nhttps://github.com/duckdb/ducklake\nhttps://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-iceberg\nhttps://github.com/duckdb/duckdb-delta</p>",

What if you would also want to run you database on the same Kubernetes stack. Will you use stateful sets? Will you use network attached storage? These types of storage are introducing a lot of disk latency because of the mandatory network hops. This is why in many environments the database servers still are dedicated machines that are treated as pets while the rest of the fleet is more like cattle.</p>\n<p>In this session I will speak about how we run our databases on Kubernetes by using the local ephemeral storage to store your data and also how we are confident we will not loose it in the process of doing so!</p>",

We’ll start with the shadow database pattern: applying schema files to a temporary PostgreSQL instance and letting Postgres handle all parsing and validation. Then we’ll explore pg_depend and the system catalogs, where PostgreSQL tracks that your view depends on a function, which depends on a table, which depends on a custom type. I’ll show the exact catalog queries that extract this dependency graph, the edge cases that make it interesting (extension-owned objects, implicit sequences, array types, function bodies that pg_depend can’t see), and how to turn it all into a correct topological ordering for migration generation.</p>\n<p>I learned this while building <a href=\"https://pgmt.dev/\">pgmt</a>, a tool that diffs PostgreSQL schemas to generate migrations. But the techniques apply to anything that needs to understand a Postgres schema -- linters, drift detectors, visualization tools, CI validation -- and they let you build on Postgres’s own knowledge instead of reinventing it.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Database usage in practice often involves heavy text processing. For example, in \"observability\" use cases, databases must extract, store, and search billions of log messages daily. Most databases, including many column-oriented OLAP databases, struggle with such massive amounts of text data. The only way to process text data at scale is by using specialized inverted indexes in databases.</p>\n<p>This presentation explains how inverted indexes work and which (text) search patterns they support. Where appropriate, we describe our experience and the gotchas we encountered when adding an inverted index to ClickHouse, one of the most popular open-source databases for analytics.</p>",

Eight years later, this talk revisits Raasveldt and Mühleisen’s argument and describes the central role that the <a href=\"https://arrow.apache.org\">Apache Arrow</a> project has played in realizing this vision—through the dissemination of Arrow IPC, Arrow Flight, Arrow Flight SQL, Arrow over HTTP, and <a href=\"https://arrow.apache.org/adbc\">ADBC</a> across numerous open source and commercial query systems. The talk concludes with a call to action to introduce Arrow-based transport to the systems that continue to “hold data hostage.”</p>",

It was expensive to run and operate, and it simply couldn’t scale to meet the customer demand we were facing. It became clear that we needed a new design.\nBy leveraging a modern architecture and the latest open-source technologies, we rebuilt our database for the cloud era. Recoveries that once took 15 minutes now complete in seconds. Operational costs dropped by 50%, and query latencies improved by 200%. These gains weren’t the result of any single change, but of a holistic redesign powered by technologies like Vortex, DataFusion, Delta Lake, and Rust. </p>\n<p>In this talk, Thor will walk you through the end-to-end journey of this evolution\nthe failure patterns and scaling limits that forced a rethink,</p>\n<p>the architectural principles that guided the redesign,</p>\n<p>the trade-offs and dead ends along the way,</p>\n<p>how modern open-source components were evaluated and integrated, and</p>\n<p>the concrete performance and reliability improvements unlocked by the new design.</p>\n<p>You’ll leave with a blueprint for modernizing a legacy data system: how to identify when your architecture is holding you back, and how to apply today’s open-source ecosystem to build a cloud-native database that’s fast, resilient, and ready for the future.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Building Android is notoriously slow and resource-hungry. Even on high-end hardware, a full AOSP build can take hours, and each release continues to grow by ~10–20%, amplifying compile times and storage pressure. For anyone maintaining custom ROMs, vendor trees, or downstream forks, faster builds are not just nice to have: regulation requiring shipping fixes faster makes build performance a core productivity issue.</p>\n<p>Over the years, the Android ecosystem has tried to keep pace with this growing complexity. Solutions like ccache and distributed build systems (goma, reclient), and even experiments with Bazel have all aimed to make builds faster and more scalable. But these tools were designed for other projects and struggle with Android’s unique challenges — lack of sandboxing, incomplete dependency tracking, and heterogeneous toolchains.</p>\n<p>This talk explains how the Android build system actually works, why incremental builds so often fall apart, and where the time really goes. We’ll then walk through the major open-source acceleration approaches, their strengths and limitations, and what it takes to run them effectively in your own infrastructure—whether you’re a hobbyist with a homelab or maintaining a large downstream tree.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Securely signing Android releases, while being a critical process and operation for every AOSP-based project, has been lacking in comprehensive documentation, especially for building a production-grade and enterprise-level signing infrastructure. This talk presents our experience in designing and implementing a Hardware Security Module (HSM)-based signing solution for CalyxOS that ensures transparency and operational practicality while upholding security standards widely endorsed by security experts with limited resources.</p>\n<p>We will walk through our process of defining criteria for secure signing operations and redesigning a signing infrastructure. In particular, we will discuss the trade-offs and our trajectory to technical decisions, including:\n* Security and operational pros and cons: Why use an HSM; \n* Our criteria for evaluating HSM solutions: Exemplified with the comparison between YubiHSM 2, Nitrokey HSM, Amazon Cloud HSM, and Entrust nShield in open-source standards, cost-effectiveness, and operational practicality; \n* PKCS#11 integration challenges: What it is, why it matters for HSM compatibility, and the specific code changes and scripts we made to to support it;\n* Key ceremony design: The use of Shamir's Secret Sharing (SSS) schema for recovery and additional backup and lessons from the provisioning process; and \n* Audit logging and cryptographic verification of signing operations.</p>\n<p>In addition, this talk invites discussions from participants on experiences in operational security and building trust through transparency and communication. We will focus on how to balance complex Android development needs and overcome challenges with constrained resource and scant systematic documentation. This talk aims to start collaborations on issues such as concurrent multi-device signing, ceremony design, and community-driven criteria across FOSS development teams.</p>",

It can search, view channels, play videos, listen to playlists, download media, and more.</p>\n<p>Developing an application with so many distinct features often involves compromises or <strong>feature trade-offs</strong>. During the talk, we'll explain how TeamNewPipe takes these decisions together with the community. In recent years the team has been supported by <strong>NewPipe e.V.</strong>, a German association which strives to promote access to libre digital media, even outside of the NewPipe app. This more general spirit dates back to the beginning of NewPipe, when the <em>backend library</em> that scrapes data from services was made independent of the user interface, making the backend ideal for use in other projects.</p>\n<p>Usually it's hard to port Android apps to other mobile Linux platforms due to the use of Java and the tight integration with the Android APIs. The user interface libraries required aren't available outside of Android emulation layers and, even if they were, the user interface paradigms would differ greatly. In this talk we'll go on to describe our efforts to <strong>port the app to Sailfish OS</strong>, a Qt-based mobile Linux platform with a user interface paradigm that differs significantly from Android's. The process took us on a <strong>fascinating journey</strong>, compiling Java code for a platform <em>without a JVM</em> and integrating it with the Qt (C++, QML, Silica) layers above.</p>\n<p>This talk will cover topics relevant to AOSP users, mobile Linux users, the Sailfish OS community, Android developers and Qt developers.</p>",

Every notebook and most computers do have cameras, too, and there's a lot of effort to get good support for them concentrated around libcamera project. Unfortunately phones have different hardware than computers (dumb vs. USB cameras) and use cases are very different.</p>\n<p>Pavel will explain challenges presented by phone hardware, explain what is needed to take good photos with phone such as Librem 5 or OnePlus 6, and explain additional challenges with video recording. He'll also talk about his work in this area, Clicks Machine and Millicam and improvements to Megapixels, Millipixels and Libcamera projects.</p>",

Unisoc is an alternative SoC manufacturer from China that is often overlooked due to its focus on the low-end segment and lack of upstream kernel support for important features.</p>\n<p>In 2024, Jolla released the C2 community phone as a new reference device for Sailfish OS, based on the low-end Reeder S19 Max Pro S from Turkey. This phone uses the Unisoc UMS9230 (Tiger T606 / T7200) SoC. A bit more than a year has passed since the phone was first released and the official port still uses libhybris. Meanwhile, I have been working on an unofficial mainline Linux port and am daily-driving it now. Some things are still not working, but there has been a lot of progress since the last FOSDEM.</p>\n<p>This talk is going to explore the challenges involved in porting mainline Linux to a new SoC platform, the features I have implemented so far, and the opportunities this creates for Sailfish OS and other mobile Linux projects such as postmarketOS.</p>\n<p>Linux kernel fork: https://codeberg.org/ums9230-mainline/linux\nSailfish OS port: https://forum.sailfishos.org/t/mainline-linux-kernel-for-the-jolla-c2/21382\npostmarketOS port: https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Jolla_C2_(jolla-c2)</p>",

We will dissect the challenges of enabling complex subsystems—from the Hexagon DSPs and Adreno 750 GPU to the intricate power domains that modern SoCs demand to properly support runtime power management and suspend-to-ram state.</p>\n<p>We will also address the often-overlooked bootloader story, showcasing the current state of upstream U-Boot on this platform and how it interacts with the standard EFI boot flow.</p>\n<p>The Talk Will Feature a Technical Post-Mortem about the whole upstreaming process and a live demonstration running mainline Linux on actual Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 powered device running the mainline kernel with code changes—proving that upstream support is no longer just for development boards.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>With cost and performance requirements becoming more and more relevant in today’s storage products, technologies that leverage algorithmic driven improvements are getting a lot of attention. Erasure coding is the most prominent algorithm and a meanwhile well established standard for saving on-disk space requirements in storage. It is built upon mathematical techniques.\nIn my talk I want to explain and explore these techniques, and thereby the mathematical reasoning underlying these algorithms in a way that does not require a background in mathematics itself (or at least only an insignificant amount). \nI am not a software engineer myself, just an interested mathematics student who aims to introduce someone who is interested and not too fond of maths to the underlying theory of erasure coding.</p>",

We have suspicions, but can’t really recall what might've splintered the system. That changes now.</p>\n<p>In this talk, we introduce a robust command history logging mechanism for CephFS: a persistent log of CephFS commands and standalone tool invocations, backed by LibCephSQLite. Think of it as “shell history,” but purpose-built for Ceph with time ranges, filters, and structured metadata. Every ceph fs subvolume rm, every ceph config set, every mischievous --force — now recorded, timestamped, and queryable.</p>\n<p>Want to know what was run last Tuesday at 3 AM? Or who triggered that well-intentioned-but-catastrophic disaster recovery script? Or just list the last 100 commands before things exploded? It’s all there. This helps debug incidents faster, provides a clear audit trail, and opens the door to proactive traceability. So, when things go sideways around CephFS and no one's sure why — this history has your back.</p>\n<p>This is CephFS-first but not CephFS-only. The path to full cluster command traceability starts here.</p>",

    "abstract": "<ul>\n<li>The pace at which quantum computing is evolving right now, threats of <code>harvest-now-decrypt-later</code> becoming more relevant. The widely deployed classical cryptographic algorithms such as RSA and ECC face a real risk of being broken by quantum attacks, most notably through Shor’s algorithm. This looming threat makes the transition to Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) urgent, not as a future project, but as a present-day migration challenge. </li>\n<li>You may have questions whether the transition to PQC is even necessary at the moment. It is true that quantum computers are years away, but it hardly matters because so many governments, telecom, defense entities worldwide are now requiring a transition.</li>\n<li>In this talk, we would focus on the practical hybrid transition from classical to quantum-resistant cryptography. We would explore NIST’s PQC standardization efforts through newly selected algorithms particularly <code>ML-KEM (key-exchange), ML-DSA and SLH-DSA (digital signatures)</code> in modern cryptographic infrastructures.</li>\n<li>The transition from classical crypto to a hybrid model enable organizations to begin adopting PQC today without breaking interoperability or relying on fully quantum-resistant stacks before they’re ready.</li>\n<li>\n<p>To make this transition concrete, we will  demonstrate a <code>TLS connection with hybrid key-exchange and post-quantum signature</code>, showing how post-quantum and classical algorithms can operate together.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>https://openssl-foundation.org/post/2025-04-29-ml-kem/index.html</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

    "abstract": "<p>Most container images in production are still unsigned, and even when signatures exist, they often provide no clear guarantee about where the artifact came from or what threat the signature is supposed to protect against. Supply-chain attacks exploit this gap and become an increasingly important issue when publishing or importing open-source software.</p>\n<p>This talk presents security capabilities in Docker and Moby BuildKit that address these issues. BuildKit executes all build steps in isolated, immutable sandboxes strictly defined by the build definition, and produces SLSA attestations with complete snapshots of the build’s source material.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Docker will provide a trusted BuildKit instance running inside GitHub Actions infrastructure. Artifacts produced there include signed attestations tied to a well-defined security boundary. The talk explains what guarantees this environment provides and how this differs from traditional approaches.</p>\n<p>The session also covers how to update container-based pipelines to always validate all BuildKit inputs (images, Git sources, HTTP sources) using Rego policies and BuildKit attestations. These checks apply both to artifacts coming from the new trusted builder instance and to any other verifiable artifacts.</p>\n<p>These improvements are designed to strengthen container security and raise the baseline for how open-source projects should sign, attest, and verify artifacts.</p>",

Sequoia git distinguishes itself from projects like sigstore in that all of the information required to authenticate commits is available locally, and no third-party authorities are required.

    "abstract": "<p>Endpoints are where most security incidents begin. Compromises often start with phishing, software vulnerabilities, or misconfigurations on individual laptops and servers. Modern security teams need rich endpoint telemetry for detection, investigation, and response. Commercial products often act as black boxes that limit flexibility, collect data in proprietary ways, and create vendor lock-in.</p>\n<p>This talk presents a practical blueprint for building a scalable endpoint telemetry and security pipeline using open technologies. At the foundation is osquery, a Linux Foundation project that turns every endpoint into a high-fidelity sensor. On top of this, we build four layers: a control layer for managing endpoints, an ingestion, streaming, and storage layer for moving and retaining data, a detection and intelligence layer for applying rules and enrichment, and a correlation, visualization, and hunting layer for analysis and response.</p>\n<p>We will walk through architectural patterns, real-world lessons, and tradeoffs. Attendees will learn how to assemble their own endpoint telemetry stack from collection to correlation without relying on closed products.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>HyperDbg is a modern, open-source hypervisor-based debugger supporting both user- and kernel-mode debugging. Operating at the hypervisor level, it bypasses OS debugging APIs and offers stealthy hooks, unlimited simulated debug registers, fine-grained memory monitoring, I/O debugging, and full execution control, enabling analysts to observe malware with far greater reliability than traditional debuggers.</p>\n<p>When it comes to debugger stealthiness and sandboxing, environment artifacts can reveal the presence of analysis tools - particularly under nested virtualization. To address this issue, we present HyperEvade, a transparency layer for HyperDbg. HyperEvade intercepts hypervisor-revealing instructions, normalizes timing sources, conceals virtualization-specific identifiers, and emulates native hardware behavior, reducing the observable footprint of the hypervisor.</p>\n<p>While perfect transparency remains a future endeavour, HyperEvade significantly raises the bar for stealthy malware analysis. By suppressing common detection vectors, it enables more realistic malware execution and reduces evasion, making HyperDbg a more dependable tool for observing evasive or self-protective malware. This talk covers HyperDbg’s architecture and features, HyperEvade’s design, and practical evaluation results.</p>\n<p>Resources:\n- HyperDbg repository: https://github.com/HyperDbg/HyperDbg/\n- Documentation: https://docs.hyperdbg.org/\n- Kernel-mode debugger design: https://research.hyperdbg.org/debugger/kernel-debugger-design/\n- Research paper: https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3548606.3560649</p>",

    "slug": "BHNWLN-rosa-backdoor-detector",
    "url": "https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/BHNWLN-rosa-backdoor-detector/",
    "abstract": "<p><strong>Backdoors in software are real</strong>. We’ve seen injections creep into open-source projects more than once. Remember the infamous xz backdoor? That was just the headline act. Before that, we have seen the PHP backdoor (2021), vsFTPd (CVE-2011-2523), and ProFTPD (CVE-2010-20103). And it doesn’t stop at open-source projects: network daemons baked into router firmware have been caught red-handed too—think Belkin F9K1102, D-Link DIR-100, and Tenda W302R. Spoiler alert: this is likely just the tip of the iceberg. <strong>Why is this so scary?</strong> Because a single backdoor in a popular open-source project or router model is basically an all-you-can-eat buffet for attackers—millions of systems served on a silver platter.</p>\n<p><strong>Finding and neutralizing backdoors means digging deep into large codebases</strong> and binary firmware. Sounds heroic, right? In practice, even for a seasoned analyst armed with reverse-engineering tools (and maybe a good Belgian beer), it’s a royal pain. So painful that, honestly, <strong>almost nobody does it</strong>. Some brave souls tried building specialized reverse tools—Firmalice, HumIDIFy, Stringer, Weasel—but those projects have been gathering dust for years. And when we tested Stringer (which hunts for hard-coded strings that might trigger backdoors), the results were… let’s say “meh”: tons of noise, so many missed hits.</p>\n<p><strong>This is where ROSA (<a href=\"https://github.com/binsec/rosa\">https://github.com/binsec/rosa</a>) comes in</strong>. Our mission? Make backdoor detection practical enough that people actually want to do it—no Belgian beer required (but appreciated!).\nOur secret weapon: fuzzing. Standard fuzzers like AFL++ (<a href=\"https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus\">https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus</a>) bombard programs with massive input sets to make them crash. It’s brute force, but it works wonders for memory-safety bugs. Backdoors, though, play a different game: they don’t crash—they hide behind secret triggers and valid behaviors.\nSo <strong>we built a mechanism that teaches fuzzers to spot the difference between “normal” and “backdoored” behavior</strong>. We integrated it into AFL++, and guess what? <strong>It nailed 7 real-world backdoors and 10 synthetic ones in our tests</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>In this talk</strong>, we’d like to show you how ROSA works, demo it live, and share ideas for making it even better. If you’re into fuzzing, reverse engineering, or just love geeking out over security, you’re in for a treat.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p><a href=\"https://landlock.io\">Landlock</a> is a Linux Security Module that empowers unprivileged processes to securely restrict their own access rights (e.g., filesystem, network). While Landlock provides powerful kernel primitives, using it typically requires modifying application code.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/landlock-lsm/island\">Island</a> makes Landlock practical for everyday workflows by acting as a high-level wrapper and policy manager. Developed alongside the kernel feature and its Rust libraries, it bridges the gap between raw security mechanisms and user activity through:\n- Zero-code integration: Runs existing binaries without modification.\n- Declarative policies: Uses TOML profiles instead of code-based rules.\n- Context-aware activation: Automatically applies security profiles based on your current working directory.\n- Full environment isolation: Manages isolated workspaces (XDG directories, TMPDIR) in addition to access control.</p>\n<p>In this talk, we will provide a brief overview of the related kernel mechanisms before diving into Island. We'll explain the main differences with other mechanisms and tools, and we'll explain Island's design and how it works, with a demo.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Open-weight LLMs (like LLaMA, Mistral, and DeepSeek-R1) have triggered a \"Cambrian explosion\" of innovation, but they have also democratized offensive cyber capabilities. Recent evaluations, such as MITRE’s OCCULT framework, show that publicly available models can now achieve &gt;90% success rates on offensive cyber knowledge tests, enabling targeted phishing, malware polymorphism, and vulnerability discovery at scale.</p>\n<p>For the Open Source community, this presents an existential crisis. Traditional security models (API gating, monitoring, rate limiting) rely on centralized control, which vanishes the moment weights are published. Furthermore, emerging regulations like the EU AI Act risk imposing impossible compliance burdens on open model developers for downstream misuse they cannot control, such as post-market monitoring.</p>\n<p>In this talk, Alfonso De Gregorio (Pwnshow) will deconstruct the \"Mitigation Gap\"—the technical reality that once a model is downloaded, safety filters can be trivially fine-tuned away. Drawing on his direct consultation work with the European Commission, he will explain how we can navigate this minefield. We will discuss:</p>\n<p>1/ The Threat Reality: A look at tools like Xanthorox AI and DeepSeek-R1 to understand the actual offensive capabilities of current open weights, and the state of the art in offensive AI.</p>\n<p>2/ The Policy Trap: Why \"strict\" interpretations of the EU AI Act could stifle open innovation, and the fight to shift liability to the modifier and deployer rather than the open-source developer.</p>\n<p>3/ The Way Forward: Technical solutions for \"Responsible Release\" (Model Cards, capability evaluations) and the necessity of AI-enabled defenses to counterbalance the offensive drop in barrier-to-entry.</p>\n<p>This session is for security practitioners and open-source advocates who want to ensure the future of AI remains open, while pragmatically addressing the security chaos it unleashes.</p>",

They're also inheriting vulnerabilities 10x faster.</p>\n<p>We need to detect AI-generated code and trace it back to its FOSS origins. The challenge: exact matching doesn't work for AI-generated code since each generation may have small variations given the same input prompt. </p>\n<p>AI-Generated Code Search (https://github.com/aboutcode-org/ai-gen-code-search) introduces a new approach using locality-sensitive hashing and content-defined chunking for approximate matching that actually works with AI output variations. This FOSS project delivers reusable open source libraries, public APIs, and open datasets that make AI code detection accessible to everyone, not just enterprises with massive budgets.</p>\n<p>In this talk, we'll explain how we fingerprint code fragments for fuzzy matching, build efficient indexes that don't balloon to terabytes, and trace AI-generated snippets back to their training data sources. We'll demo real examples of inherited vulnerabilities, show how it integrates with existing FOSS tools for SBOM and supply chain analysis, and explain how this directly supports CRA compliance for tracking code origin.</p>\n<p>Bottom line: if AI-generated code is in your dependencies (and it probably is), you need visibility into what it's derived from and what risks it carries. This project gives you the FOSS tools and data to find out.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>As cyber threats grow in sophistication, the “trust but verify” model is no longer enough. Organizations are rapidly shifting toward Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) — a security paradigm where no user or device is inherently trusted, inside or outside the network. </p>\n<p>Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) is no longer a buzzword—it’s a necessity. With traditional perimeter-based security models failing to address modern threats like lateral movement and insider attacks, organizations are increasingly adopting ZTA’s \"never trust, always verify\" philosophy.  </p>\n<p>This architecture is built on several pillars: \n  -  Identity-centric protection defining identity as the new perimeter. \n  -  Dynamic micro segmentation and contextual access controls to isolate resources. \n  -  Continuous monitoring and behavioural analytics to detect sophisticated lateral movements and insider threats. \nModern ZTA implementations employ AI and automation for adaptive threat detection and response, dramatically reducing breach costs and attack surfaces for distributed enterprises. Adoption of Zero Trust is rapidly increasing, with industry research indicating that over 70% of organizations are integrating ZTA in their cybersecurity frameworks and at least 70% of new remote access deployments will rely on these principles by the end of 2025. Despite its robust security benefits, ZTA demands substantial investment in identity management, policy enforcement, and ongoing operational monitoring. </p>\n<p>But how do we move from theoretical principles to practical implementation? </p>\n<p>This talk explores the why and how of ZTA adoption for mid-level engineers and security practitioners. We’ll break down core ZTA components—identity-centric access, micro segmentation, and continuous monitoring—using real-world examples . </p>\n<p>Attendees will leave with: \n•  A clear roadmap for phased ZTA adoption, starting with high-value assets. \n•  Strategies to balance security and user experience (e.g., just-in-time access). \n•  Lessons from industry leaders like IBM on overcoming common pitfalls. </p>\n<p>Whether you’re in DevOps, cloud security, or IT governance, this session will equip you to champion ZTA in your organization</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>In 2020 the Dutch government adopted the 'open, unless' principle, promoting the use and procurement of open source software, unless impossible. But what happens after such a policy is published? This isn’t as straightforward as we’d think. Within government projects, we still regularly need to answer practical questions such as “are we allowed to build or buy this? Are we allowed or required to publish our code? What do we need security wise? What do our procurement policies say? Where do we put the code? Does code need to be archived like documents? How do we collaborate with other government tenants? And how do we support the open source communities whose code we use?” The ‘open, unless’ principle is clear on paper, but applying it turns out to be more complex.</p>\n<p>In this talk, we will look at how the Dutch are putting 'open, unless' into practice inside the Ministry of the Interior (BZK), through the daily work of our Open Source Program Office (OSPO). Instead of focusing on just policy, the focus is on the operational side. Once the choice for open source is made, what challenges arise then? This will be illustrated with concrete project examples. The first is MijnBureau, a sovereign open source workspace for the government, that has been built openly from the start. The second example is the Dutch Government Codeplatform, a shared development environment, based on Forgejo. A third example is OpenKat, a collectively built open source vulnerability scanner. Together we’ll explore how 'open, unless' is applied in a consistent way (spoiler alert: it’s not). </p>\n<p>These examples show what “from policy to practice” actually looks like for the public-sector. For instance, many open source projects start bottom-up. How do we ensure proper top-down alignment with national strategies, adequate funding and sponsorship? When a project is done, who is going to manage and maintain it? How do we make sure we don’t take advantage of open source communities? </p>\n<p>This talk is aimed at anyone interested in public-sector open source, OSPOs, procurement and policy implementation, or in understanding why “just publish code” is rarely as easy as it sounds, and what we can do to make it easier.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Open source initiatives usually bubble up from the grassroots community, and while governments have been paying more attention recently, policy is often subject to the whims of election cycles. This means long-term continuity is never guaranteed.</p>\n<p>Even when policies are in place, their implementation can be hampered by two significant factors: civil servants' open-source literacy and existing legal/regulatory bottlenecks. Sure, enshrining open source into law would make it mandatory and sustainable, but let’s be real—the legislative process is painfully slow.</p>\n<p>The Open Culture Foundation (OCF) has been deeply embedded in Taiwan’s open source scene for over a decade. Some of our members have been tracking the government’s on-again, off-again open-source journey for nearly 30 years, since the early community days. Others have even moved from leading government open-source policy to eventually return to the non-profit sector. Throughout this journey, OCF has continually adapted how we collaborate with and support the government, seeking the best communication strategies and case studies—all while managing the inevitable cycles of disappointment and excitement.</p>\n<p>Most recently, we saw Audrey Tang depart from the Ministry of Digital Affairs (MODA), and the government's visible focus on open source has noticeably dialed down. However, we also found like-minded partners in the Taipei City Government's Department of Information Technology (DOIT). We are now working with them to ensure that open source software continues to be adopted and deployed within the government.</p>\n<p>In this 30-minute session, we’ll be sharing the different collaboration models we’ve developed with the government and the tangible deliverables we’ve produced. Crucially, we’ll also discuss how we keep the momentum going and move forward even when we face headwinds.</p>",

SFC brought the case as a third-party beneficiary of these copyleft agreements, to demonstrate how users of copylefted software can directly enforce the agreements if a company fails to comply.</p>\n<p>The case finally made it to trial two weeks ago, after several long years of negotiation, hearings, and source candidate reviews.

    "abstract": "<p>This talk details the currently-planned litigation strategy of FOSS Users e.V. (https://foss-users.eu) for the next decade. We are also looking for the community for feedback on other possible strategies. The first part of our current strategy is to get precedent that copyleft violations can be pursued with injunctions against consumer rights infringements in Germany. This is best done with the most obvious violation first: lock down of LGPLed libraries. The next issue will be proprietary Linux kernel modules using EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPLed interfaces.</p>\n<p>This talk wants to explore the options we, as a community, have to safeguard copyleft and software freedom.\nTo this end, the talk takes a two-pronged approach. First, it calls on the community to come up with clever ideas about how to enforce copyleft licenses and protect our commons from more and more savvy and blatant violators. Second, the main part of the talk will be to present my ideas so far on how we should move forward in the next decade. Subject to community feeback on these ideas, I propose that we frame copyleft violations as consumer rights infringements and have a consumer association getting injunctions against these infringements. More broadly speaking, we need a community of hobby legal experts taking the burden from the developers to enforce copyleft. If these hobbyists pursue violations in a rewarding way, they can sustainably take on the task of enforcing the developers' will.\nThe presentation will conclude with discussion of how the audience can contribute. First, they could become members of the consumers association already incorporated in Germany, of FOSS Users e.V. . Under German law, consumers associations need at least 75 members to be allowed to sue. Second, they could donate money for copyleft enforcement. Third, they could make suggestions for improvements to the plan and contribute new ideas to incorporate.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>FOSS communities have historically developed governance models that include within them biases and other problems, often belatedly recognized. For example, there is now general agreement  that no dictator can be benevolent. Common alternatives to the \"benevolent\" dictator— the \"meritocracy\", \"do-acracy\", and the self-perpetuating committee — also have serious problems. Often the alternative offered to these kinds of governance systems is for some kind of elected governance body.</p>\n<p>Democratic governance institutions are messy, however.  We'll consider some historical examples of problems that have occurred in various democratic FOSS initiatives and organizations, and will focus particularly on the Open Source Initiative (OSI) board of directors elections of 2025. We'll  consider the question: how can we design elected governance bodies for FOSS that truly represent the views of our community and are held properly accountable to their constituencies?</p>\n<p>Joe 'Zonker' Brockmeier will moderate this panel, and additional individuals have been invited and will be added once they are confirmed.</p>",

Direct device passthrough is infeasible, as it monopolizes the display and host system resources. Consequently, achieving high-performance LLM inference requires a sophisticated bridging mechanism.</p>\n<p><strong>The Solution: Para-Virtualization via GGML API Remoting</strong></p>\n<p>We present the implementation of an <strong>API-remoting, para-virtualized execution path for llama.cpp</strong>. This novel design is built directly on the <strong>GGML API</strong>, allowing us to selectively offload compute-intensive operations to execute on the macOS host. Crucially, this execution path <strong>natively leverages the GGML-Metal backend</strong>, achieving <strong>full-speed host performance</strong>.\nThis strategy preserves a fully containerized Linux developer experience inside the virtual machine while achieving hardware-level acceleration outside of it.</p>\n<p><strong>Performance and Implications</strong></p>\n<p>We will share concrete performance results demonstrating near-native inference speed compared to running llama.cpp directly on the host. The talk will examine the architectural trade-offs of this split-execution model, providing insight into:\n* The implementation details of the para-virtualized GGML API bridge.\n* The latency overhead of API remoting versus the throughput gain from host GPU execution.\n* How this open-source approach fundamentally changes the future of containerized and accelerated AI tooling on non-Linux platforms, specifically addressing the needs of macOS users in the open-source AI community.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Over the past decade, CPU vector units have evolved faster than most software stacks have adapted. From AVX2 and AVX-512 to NEON, SVE/SVE2, AMX, and SME, each generation introduced wider registers, richer predication, new mixed-precision formats, and entirely new execution models. Yet extracting sustained throughput from these extensions requires understanding architectural asymmetries, compiler behaviour, portability constraints, and the practical limits of auto-vectorisation.</p>\n<p>This session distills ten years of developing SIMD kernels deployed inside large-scale open-source systems, including USearch — a high-throughput vector search engine embedded today in many modern DBMS projects — as well as StringZilla, SimSIMD, and bioinformatics tools. We will examine how different CPU families behave on identical workloads, which instructions consistently deliver real speedups, which look promising but rarely pay off, and where compilers do (and do not) generate optimal vector code.</p>\n<p>Case studies include: AVX-512 reductions exceeding 300 GB/s on current x86 machines; i8/u8 and bf16 pipelines on NEON and SVE2; practical limits of AMX tiles for dense math; and early insights into SME’s streaming execution model. Each example is shown through minimal, reproducible kernel fragments.</p>\n<p>Beyond raw performance, the talk outlines when SIMD is the right tool: which classes of problems benefit most, when auto-vectorisation is sufficient, and when hand-written intrinsics or assembly are justified. We will also discuss hardware selection for SIMD-heavy workloads — both on-prem and in the cloud — and what upcoming extensions mean for open-source systems in the next decade.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>In the era of big data and artificial intelligence, organizations are increasingly relying on data lakehouses to store, process, and analyze vast amounts of structured and unstructured data. The path from raw data to a production-ready AI model is complex, often bottlenecked by data inconsistencies, schema drift, and a lack of data versioning. In the spirit of open source AI hacking, the focus must shift to ensuring the underlying data infrastructure is as reliable and reproducible as the models themselves.\nThis presentation addresses the critical role of Open Table Formats (OTFs)—specifically Apache Iceberg, Delta Lake, and Apache Hudi—in transforming unstructured data lakes into reliable, queryable data lakehouses. OTFs provide database-like capabilities, including ACID transactions, schema evolution, and time travel, directly on low-cost object storage\nThe talk will provide a practical overview of integrating open-source OTFs with popular AI/ML frameworks, empowering \"AI Plumbers\" to build robust, governed, and highly performant data foundations for their next generation of open-source models</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>The growing energy demands of modern AI models pose a significant barrier to sustainable computing. As model complexity and deployment scale continue to rise, training and inference increasingly contribute to carbon emissions and operational costs. This talk begins by examining the technical challenges of accurately measuring energy consumption at multiple levels of abstraction—from system-wide and process-level metrics down to individual source code methods and API calls. Practical strategies for overcoming these measurement hurdles are discussed.\nThe second part of the talk explores power consumption patterns in GPU kernels, highlighting how thread configuration, block geometry, and power limit settings shape kernel-level energy efficiency. We demonstrate how these characteristics influence power draw and discuss techniques for predicting consumption based on kernel properties. The session concludes with insights and best practices for managing performance–energy trade-offs in GPU-accelerated AI applications, offering a path toward more sustainable AI development.</p>",

As part of this session, we will also briefly share DeepComputing’s AI product roadmap to illustrate how these engineering breakthroughs translate into real devices.\nIn this talk, engineers from DeepComputing and Tenstorrent will share how we are solving these challenges together across two ends of the computing spectrum:\n    • AI PC / edge devices:\nHow we integrate high-performance RISC-V CPUs with NPUs, optimize dataflow for multi-die architectures, and overcome compiler/runtime fragmentation to run LLMs locally.\n    • AI servers:\nHow Tenstorrent’s RISC-V cores and scalable mesh architecture handle AI workloads; how we bridge the software gap (compilers, toolchains, scheduling, kernel-level tuning); and how we standardize low-level interfaces for AI compute.\nThe focus is on how these problems are solved—microarchitecture decisions, data movement, kernel optimizations, interoperability layers, and lessons learned from building real products. This session will show why “All in RISC-V, RISC-V All in AI” is no longer a slogan but a practical engineering path forward.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>For nearly a decade, Open Collective has served as the financial and legal infrastructure for over 3,000 open source projects, managing millions in funding. However, for much of that history, the platform itself was owned by Venture Capitalists a tension that sits at the heart of the FOSS funding conversation.</p>\n<p>In this talk, we reveal how the platform’s largest users, specifically the Open Source Collective—orchestrated a coup to boot out the initial investors and restructure the entity into a 501(c)(6) membership non-profit - Open Finance Consortium (https://oficonsortium.org/). This is a case study in \"Exit to Community\" (E2C), demonstrating a radical alternative to the traditional startup exit that often threatens FOSS sustainability. https://blog.opencollective.com/the-open-collective-platform-is-moving-to-a-community-governed-non-profit/</p>\n<p>We will move beyond the celebration of the acquisition to discuss the hard realities that followed. It is one thing to \"free\" a platform; it is another to sustain it. We will explore:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The Negotiation: How a Fiscal Host leveraged its position to facilitate a transition from private equity to community ownership.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Governance vs. Reality: The evolution of our shared governance model and the difficulty of putting democratic ideals into practice while running a complex tech stack.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Financials: The transparent challenges of achieving financial sustainability without the cushion of VC cash flow, and what was sacrificed in the process.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This session is for maintainers, funders, and policymakers interested in the structural future of FOSS infrastructure. We offer not just a success story, but a candid look at the friction involved in building a technology platform that is truly owned by the ecosystem it serves.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Free software has no shortage of talent, ideas, or users, but it does have a funding problem. The largest potential funding source already exists: public procurement. Governments spend billions each year on software and digital services, but most of that money flows into proprietary silos that limit transparency, reuse, and sovereignty.</p>\n<p>If we take “Public Money, Public Code” - https://publiccode.eu -  seriously, we must recognize that procurement (not donations or sponsorships) is the most powerful lever to sustain open source. Every government contract is a potential long-term investment in the commons.</p>\n<p>This talk examines how procurement practices can become the backbone of sustainable free software ecosystems:\n    •   Why procurement reform is essential to digital sovereignty.\n    •   How existing frameworks (e.g., the EU Open Source Strategy - https://commission.europa.eu/about/departments-and-executive-agencies/digital-services/open-source-software-strategy_en ) still fall short.\n    •   How to structure tenders, contracts, and governance to ensure open deliverables.\n    •   Why governments should stop “buying software” and start funding maintenance and collaboration.\n    •   The opportunity for community organizations and small firms to compete fairly.</p>\n<p>Procurement is where ideals meet infrastructure. By redirecting even a small fraction of public IT budgets toward open, reusable solutions, we can achieve what years of advocacy and fundraising have not: a self-sustaining free software ecosystem that serves everyone.</p>",

Traditionally, the EU budget has been focused on regional development and agriculture, but more and more policymakers are realizing that investment in our digital infrastructure is just as important as maintaining physical roads and bridges. Last year at FOSDEM, we discussed with you what an EU fund for open source maintenance should look like. A lot has happened since then: We have conducted an in-depth study into the political, legal and economic feasibility of an EU-STF, building on the successful example of the German Sovereign Tech Agency. We assembled a coalition of supporters from industry and civil society, and we have presented our proposal to the European Parliament and Member States.</p>\n<p>Now it’s time to take the campaign to the next level and we need your support to make it happen. The goal of this session is to present the findings of the feasibility study for the EU-STF and demonstrate why mission-driven investment, coordinated by the public sector, is important for the diversification of Europe’s funding landscape. It will demonstrate concretely how such a proposal can directly improve the sustainability and health of the open source community globally, and why this is so important for Europe in achieving its digital future.</p>",

The lack of coordination forces projects to pursue multiple, often overlapping opportunities, and forces funders to independently evaluate projects and proposals, resulting in duplicated effort and suboptimal resource distribution. </p>\n<p>By examining existing collaboration models, including centralized and distributed approaches, we highlight how joint decision-making mechanisms could improve sustainability for reusable software resources. An international set of examples illustrates how cross-organization cooperation for research software funding can be structured. Such collaborations can optimize grant disbursement and align priorities. Increased collaboration could allow funders to better address the ongoing maintenance and evolution of research software, lowering barriers that hamper discovery across multiple research domains. Encouraging both bottom-up user-driven and top-down coordination mechanisms ultimately supports more robust, widely accessible research software, improving global research outcomes.</p>",

We also sought to understand the disconnect between the needs of FOSS projects and what funders can provide.</p>\n<p>In this talk, we share early insights from our interviews. We will share current funder challenges, like differentiating between reactive vs. proactive impact reporting and translating technical outcomes into policy-maker language. Interestingly, we’re are hosting a workshop here at FOSDEM with FOSS funders to co-design on a shared Funding Impact Taxonomy and Measurement Guidelines co-designed. We will share with the audience the the latest learnings and offer a space for further discussion. We may not bring any solutions but we will advance the dialog, so that funders and FOSS projects can better understand each other.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Open source foundations face growing demands, more projects, more users, more scrutiny, while still relying on fragile funding models built around grants, sponsorships, and donations. This talk argues that the problem is not funding open source projects, but funding them in isolation.</p>\n<p>Drawing on experiences from the Apereo and the eBPF Foundations, this session explores a shift from project-centric funding to ecosystem-level investment. Using eBPF as a case study, it shows how funding efforts like security audits, upstream kernel work, directed development, face-to-face collaboration, and ecosystem marketing can strengthen many projects at once and deliver far greater impact per dollar.</p>\n<p>The talk also introduces Apereo's self-sustainability model, in which foundations, even projects, support themselves through services rooted in community expertise, such as training, events, audits, and operational support, rather than perpetual fundraising. The goal is not to create more foundations, but ones more focused on ecosystems that are resilient by design, and able to support open source as shared infrastructure rather than a collection of individual projects.</p>",

Furthermore there is a big promise in VC funding for open source, also in Europe, with the number and value of transactions rising in recent years, with $26.4B invested in 2024 and strong investment performance indicators. </p>\n<p>As vertical sectors like finance, energy, telco, and agriculture increasingly embrace open source as a pillar of their digital transformation, it’s clear that commercial open source has become a superior venture model and a strategic opportunity for Europe, but one that requires engaging diverse stakeholders and mutual education on the opportunities at hand. </p>\n<p>In this talk we will share Linux Foundation Europe’s experience of building (and balancing) some of the largest global open source ecosystems as well as Commit’s unique perspective as the first fund solely focused on commercial open source investments in Europe.</p>",

Up until DWARF-5, the execution model of such DWARF expressions was not expressive enough to describe how objects are placed on GPUs, or even on CPUs in some cases too.  DWARF 6 addresses this by making DWARF locations regular stack elements on the DWARF expression evaluation stack, which has many interesting cascading consequences, including enabling expressiveness, factorization, and more.</p>\n<p>In this presentation, we will discuss the execution model of DWARF expressions, the proposed changes and follow-up extensions this change enables.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>OpenMP is a widely used framework for parallelizing applications, enabling thread-level parallelism via simple source-code annotations. It follows the fork-join model and relies heavily on barrier synchronization among worker threads. Running OpenMP- enabled applications in the cloud is increasingly popular due to elasticity, fast startup, and pay-as-you-go pricing.</p>\n<p>In cloud-based execution, worker threads run inside a virtual machine (VM) and are subject to dual levels of scheduling: threads are placed on guest virtual CPUs (vCPUs), and vCPUs run as ordinary tasks on the host’s physical CPUs (pCPUs). The guest scheduler places threads on vCPUs, while the host scheduler places vCPUs on pCPUs. Because these schedulers act independently, a semantic gap emerges that can undermine application performance. Barrier synchronization, whose efficiency depends on timely scheduling decisions, is vulnerable to this semantic gap, and remains under-explored.</p>\n<p>This talk presents my PhD thesis project supervised by Julia LAWALL and Jean-Pierre Lozi at Inria Paris. The thesis defines Phantom vCPUs to describe problematic host-level preemptions in which guest vCPUs remain queued on busy pCPUs, stalling progress. We show that OpenMP performance can be substantially improved inside oversubscribed cloud VMs by (1) dynamically adapting the degree of parallelism (DoP) at the start of each parallel region and (2) dynamically choosing between spinning versus blocking at barriers on a per-thread, per-barrier basis. We propose paravirtualized, scheduler-informed techniques that accurately guide these decisions and demonstrate their effectiveness in realistic deployments. </p>\n<p>The first contribution of this thesis is Phantom Tracker,  an algorithmic solution implemented in the Linux kernel that leverages paravirtualized task scheduling to detect and quantify Phantom vCPUs accurately. the second contribution is pv-barrier-sync, a dynamic barrier synchronization mechanism driven by the scheduler insights produced by Phantom Tracker. The third and final contribution of is Juunansei, an OpenMP runtime extension that demonstrates the practical utility of Phantom Tracker and pv-barrier-sync with additional optimizations.</p>\n<p>The talk discusses the context and motivation of this work, followed by a brief introduction of the Phantom Tracker, and then takes a deep dive into the libgomp implementation of  pv-barrier-sync and Juunansei.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>A critical challenge in C as a general-purpose language is the absence of the notion of secret data in its abstract machine. This results in information disclosure be poorly detected by compilers that lack the required semantics to model any vulnerability related to secrets leakage. Numerous dedicated tools have exists to overcome this limitation; each of which comes with its own annotation rules, tainting model, and more importantly, its own narrow scope for a specific disclosure vulnerability. Such discrepancy has created confusion for the concerned developers that are mostly unwilling to support multiple external tools, especially when they address one problem at a time. In this talk, we introduce the required C constructions to bring secrets to the GCC compiler through its system of attributes. The resulted framework, that we call GnuSecret, does not only define consistent notations and semantics to designate secrets directly in the Gnu-C language, but also propagates them throughout the program code by leveraging the symbolic execution engine embedded into the GCC Static Analyzer (GSA). Of particular interest, GnuSecret is not bound to a specific vulnerability, as its modular design allows it to virtually model any vulnerability related to the MITRE's CWE-200 and its children.</p>",

However, when applied to large codebases, ORC often exhibits a surprisingly high front-load ratio: we have to parse all IR modules before execution even reaches main(). This diminishes the benefits of JITing and contributes to phenomena as the “time to first plot” latency in Julia, one of ORC’s large-scale users [2].</p>\n<p>The llvm-autojit plugin [3] is a new experimental compiler extension for automatic just-in-time compilation with ORC.  The project reached a proof-of-concept state, where basic C, C++ and Rust programs build and run successfully. It integrates easily with build systems like CMake, make and cargo, making it practical to apply to real-world projects.</p>\n<p>In this talk, we will examine the front-loading issue in ORC and explain how llvm-autojit mitigates it. Attendees will learn about pass plugins, LLVM IR code transformations, callgraphs and runtime libraries.

Companies spend months designing NPUs (neural processing units), then more months building compilers for them—only to discover the hardware doesn't efficiently run their target workloads.

Starting from a computation expressed in MLIR's Linalg dialect, our toolchain automatically generates synthesizable SystemVerilog for custom NPU architectures and hooks it up automatically to a RISC-V control host with an optimized memory hierarchy.</p>\n<p>This \"algorithm-first\" hardware generation inverts the traditional flow: instead of designing hardware then hoping the compiler can use it effectively, we generate hardware that is provably optimal for specific Linalg operations. The approach enables rapid exploration of the hardware/algorithm co-design space: change the algorithm, regenerate the hardware, and immediately see the impact on area, power, and performance.\nIn this talk, we'll demonstrate:\n* Live generation of NPU RTL from Linalg operations\n* The MLIR dialect stack that bridges high-level algorithms to CIRCT hardware representations\n* Performance comparisons between generated hardware and handmade open-source NPUs\n* Open questions around generalization vs. specialization trade-offs</p>\n<p>This work aims to make hardware generation accessible to compiler engineers and algorithm researchers, not just hardware designers.

Developers rely on REPL-driven exploration, rapid iteration, rich visualisation, and debugging, but C++ lacked incremental execution, notebook integration, browser-based execution, and JIT debugging. With the introduction of <a href=\"https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangRepl.html\">clang-repl</a>, LLVM now provides an upstream incremental compilation engine built on Clang, the IncrementalParser, and the ORC JIT.</p>\n<p>This talk presents how the Project Jupyter, Clang/clang-repl, and Emscripten communities collaborated to build a complete, upstream-aligned interactive C++ environment. <a href=\"https://github.com/compiler-research/xeus-cpp\">Xeus-Cpp</a> embeds clang-repl as a native C/C++ Jupyter kernel across Linux, macOS, and Windows, enabling widgets, plots, inline documentation, and even CUDA/OpenMP use cases. <a href=\"https://compiler-research.org/xeus-cpp-wasm/lab/index.html\">Xeus-Cpp-Lite</a> extends this model to the browser via WebAssembly and JupyterLite, compiling LLVM and Clang to WASM and using wasm-ld to dynamically link shared wasm modules generated per cell at runtime.</p>\n<p>To complete the workflow, Xeus-Cpp integrates LLDB-DAP through clang-repl’s out-of-process execution model, enabling breakpoints, stepping, variable inspection, and full debugging of JIT-generated code directly in JupyterLab.</p>\n<p>The talk will detail how clang-repl, ORC JIT, wasm-ld, LLDB, and LLDB-DAP come together to deliver a modern, sustainable interactive C++ workflow on both desktop and browser platforms, with live demonstrations of native and WebAssembly execution along the way.</p>\n<p><strong>LLVM Components Involved :</strong> clang, clang-repl, orc jit, wasm-ld, lldb, lldb-dap.</p>\n<p><strong>Target Audience :</strong> Researchers, Educators, Students, C/C++ Practitioners</p>\n<p><strong>Note :</strong> Please make sure to check out the demos/links added to the Resource section.

Is it time for an Open Source tax? Would paying volunteers actually motivate or demotivate them?\nThis is not just a talk about money.

    "abstract": "<p>In today's world everyone just gets open source ... at least you don't\nhave to explain what it is any more.  However, the way a corporation\nruns is based on transaction needs rather than deep philosophical\nbeliefs, so Open Source and your place within a corporation (and often\nyour value to it) depend on your ability to translate between these\ntwo positions.  This talk aims to equip modern open source developers\nwith the ability to navigate this translation effectively.  And,\nalthough the transaction nature means trust is fleeting, constantly\nadjusting to the transactional needs can build fleeting trust into a\nlonger term reliance.</p>\n<p>Although Linux isn't the first open source project, it is the first\none to begin successfully co-opting corporations into its development\nmodel. In the beginning Linux was a wholly volunteer operation that\nleaked into corporate data centres via subversive means.  When the\nleak became a flood those in charge of the data centres reluctantly\nblessed Linux deployment to avoid being swept away.  This meant that\nall the ancillary producers (drivers for hardware, databases,\nindustrial applications etc.) all had to come to Linux on its own\nterms (which we, the Linux community hadn't actually thought about at\nthe time).  It also meant that relationships that began completely\nantagonistically usually ended up being harmonious (yesterday's enemy\nalmost always became today's friend). The result was a years long\nsomewhat collaborative project to develop rules of engagement between\nopen source projects and corporations.</p>\n<p>This talk will cover three things that came out of these rules of\nengagement:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>agency: a corporation deals with open source through its developers\nat the code face.  They are empowered to make decisions on its behalf\nway beyond any proprietary developer ever was and this empowerment\nchanges the internal as well as external dynamics of employer to\nemployee interaction.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Mutual Development: As an open source contributor you become\nresponsible for deciding what's best for the project (and persuading\nyour employer to agree).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Strategic misalignment: although corporations understand that they\nhave to do open source, internally there's often an uneven penetration\nof how to do it.  Thus a significant part of a good open source\nemployees time is spent doing internal alignment to make sure internal\nlack of comprehension doesn't get it the way of sound execution.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We'll give examples of how to leverage these rules, an understanding\nof which will allow you to build a shifting transactional trust\nbetween you want your employer.</p>",

Unlike commercial companies, open source projects don’t have legions of recruiters to bring people into the fold—and yet our projects need a steady stream of new contributors. Or should open source projects assume that new contributors (and future committers) will continue to “self-select” onto the project? </p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/\">PostgreSQL open source project</a> turns 30 in 2026 (Happy Birthday!). It has evolved from a small project that some referred to as “just a toy”—to today, where Postgres is thriving with an active community and a vast ecosystem of extensions and tooling. The project has clearly done some things right. Postgres is hugely popular, with a healthy upstream open source community plus a host of companies and products built around Postgres itself. </p>\n<p>And Postgres is owned by no one company; instead, a multitude of competing interests align as people from different countries and continents roll up their sleeves to get the work done. But what happens when the current generation of Postgres committers step back or retire—where will the next generation of Postgres contributors come from? </p>\n<p>Postgres isn’t special in needing new contributors. It just happens to be a 30-year-old project whose successes, experiments, and failures might apply to other communities too. In this talk, we’ll look at how contributors find their way into Postgres: what worked, what didn’t, and where we’re still struggling.

    "abstract": "<p>Open source represents 70% to 90% of modern software codebases and this is today seen as as a crucial global public infrastructure by many players. Given its ubiquity, this is increasingly part of geopolitical discussions and national-security agendas. This presentation will analyze the risks and governance challenges at the intersection of open source and global politics, with a focus on the recent European discourse on digital sovereignty and supply-chain security.</p>\n<p>The core dilemma is that open source's power lies in the mutualization of risk (collective maintenance and faster vulnerability detection), but this is being undermined by fragmentation along national and corporate lines. We will explore:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>The Weaponization of Open Source: How jurisdictional control over key platforms (like GitHub and PyPI, largely hosted by US entities) translates into geopolitical tools (the \"Panopticon\" and \"Chokepoint\" effects), as seen in the 2019 GitHub sanctions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Lack of Investment: The crisis of critical components being maintained by small, under-resourced teams, creating an ecosystem that powers the global economy but lacks the resources to secure itself (e.g., the Log4j incident, XZ, and others).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The Fragmentation Trend: The response from nations like China, which are building domestic repositories (Gitee, OpenAtom Foundation) as part of a plan for technological self-sufficiency. This fragmentation reduces interoperability and shared visibility. This makes open source more weak and less resilient.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The presentation will conclude by openly discussing a shared call to action for the FOSS community: How can we forge a stronger shared responsibility between developers, policymakers, and industry to mitigate these losses and keep open source secure, interoperable, and globally accessible?.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Over the past twenty years, I've written about esolangs as a hacker folk art for the blog esoteric.codes, bringing the voice of many esolangers together, to find crossover in their approach to computation as a medium. Meanwhile, I've produced esolangs of my own, recently brought together by MIT Press in Forty-Four Esolangs. </p>\n<p>This talk brings together both projects, to show the potential of this hacker folk art to go far beyond the listicles of puzzle languages and joke languages with which it is often associated. Its languages ask programmers to write code as a series of photographs, or by two programmers typing in tandem, or using global variables that are global across the world. It presents esolangs as challenges to conventional ideas about code: everything from \"the cognitive gap between the text and performance  of code should be as small possible\" to \"languages should lead to runnable programs\" or even \"code should be written with intent.\"</p>\n<p>This talk emphasizes esolangs as a community form built on dialogue between esolangers and the esoprogrammers who explore their ideas and find the limits of their languages. I hope to inspire more programmers to recognize esolangs as our own space of play and embrace it as an experimental medium. In this moment, when AI tools help reinforce a particular, corporatized vision of how code should look, esolangs offer resistance to this monostyle and against the de-skilling of programming as art.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>The promise of smartphones was freedom in your pocket. The reality? Two corporate gatekeepers controlling what software billions of users can run on devices they supposedly own. This talk examines the uncomfortable compromises FLOSS developers face when trying to distribute apps through iOS and Android app stores, where every principle we hold dear—user freedom, privacy, transparency, and community control—runs headlong into the profit-driven interests of the global mobile duopoly.</p>\n<p>We'll explore the battleground where free software principles meet platform restrictions: mandatory code signing that undermines reproducible builds, opaque review processes that can arbitrarily reject apps exercising user freedom, 30% revenue cuts that punish sustainable FLOSS funding models, and Terms of Service that can revoke your ability to distribute software overnight. The Digital Markets Act promised to open these walled gardens, but has it? Or have we merely traded one gatekeeper's rules for slightly different ones?</p>\n<p>This isn't just about technical hurdles—it's about fundamental questions. Should FLOSS projects compromise on GPL compliance to reach users? Is it ethical to pay fees and developer taxes when that money funds the very infrastructure restricting user freedom? When F-Droid and alternative app stores offer true freedom but reach only 2% of users, do we accept the compromise or maintain ideological purity while our potential impact dwindles?</p>\n<p>The stakes are existential. As our digital lives increasingly occur on locked-down mobile devices, FLOSS becomes the last line of defense against surveillance capitalism, planned obsolescence, and the erosion of user agency. If we can't effectively distribute free software on the platforms where users actually are, we risk relegating FLOSS to irrelevance precisely when it's needed most.</p>\n<p>But there's hope. New regulatory frameworks, emerging alternative stores, advances in progressive web apps, and creative technical solutions offer paths forward. We'll discuss practical strategies for maximizing reach while minimizing compromise, building communities that value freedom over convenience, and preparing for a post-duopoly future.</p>\n<p>This talk will challenge both the compromisers and the purists, asking uncomfortable questions: Are we collaborating with platforms that fundamentally oppose our values? Or are we pragmatically meeting users where they are? The answer may determine whether free software thrives or withers in the mobile era.</p>",

Suffice to say, these are not your grandma's sewing patterns.</p>\n<p>This talk will cover why I started FreeSewing, the pain points it aims to address, and how it works under the hood. I'll also cover our tech stack, and the choices we've made in this area, as well as how we needed to adapt as we outgrew our earlier choices. In addition, I'll cover some of the lessons learned after more than a decade of designing parametric sewing patterns for bodies in all shapes and forms.

    "abstract": "<p>The story “Ada &amp; Zangemann – A Tale of Software, Skateboards and Raspberry Ice Cream” inspires the software freedom community because it covers more than the simple value of learning to program. It also covers the importance of control over technology and its impact on society. In this way the story is inspiring many kids, teens, parents and many others to learn programming and shape technology.</p>\n<p>I too was captivated by the story. Working on a Dutch translation sent me down the path of improving the automation to help others like me to translate the story and publish it in different formats. The free culture license of the book enables and compels the community to adapt it, and they have. The community keeps surprising us with new formats to convey the story. Since its release it has been translated into 30 languages, published as a book in 7 and as movie in 5. And it is available in a growing number of other formats: epub, online book, bilingual book and kamishibai.</p>\n<p>Translation and localization is the primary purpose of the automation. More interesting and ambition is to support the increasing number of formats: from printed book, to online book, voiceover text and subtitles. This wide variety of formats presents a unique challenge for which no ready-made solution exists. By leveraging open standards (XML, Docbook, ITS) and Free Software (Scribus, itstool, gettext, xsltproc, pandoc, Weblate) we created automation that enables translators to add new languages while also enabling new formats to be added.  This includes a novel method for inserting text and images into Scribus. This multi-media setup can be used as inspiration for other free culture multi-media projects.</p>\n<p>In this presentation we will tell the story how the automation developed over time. We'll share the inspiring stories from the community that leveraged the automation and influenced its development. The technical challenge of the automation is fun, but the community stories give it meaning and motivate me to keep at it.</p>\n<p>With this presentation we hope to inspire others to contribute to the Ada &amp; Zangemann community by translating, adding a new format or contributing to the automation and to share own materials benefiting our community as Open Educational Resources.</p>",

It wiped my data. Twice. On the bright side, it taught me the value of backups.</p>\n<p>Fast forward to 2025: btrfs is no longer the experimental filesystem of the past. It's stable, mature, feature-rich, and fully part of the Linux kernel. But old reputations die hard. Even today, Google Cloud Platform doesn’t officially support it—not because of technical shortcomings, but because customer demand hasn’t pushed the issue.</p>\n<p>At Chronosphere, we decided to take a fresh look. After months of evaluation and testing, we migrated petabytes of customer data across thousands of disks to btrfs. This talk is our story: why we made the leap, what we learned along the way, and how we’re helping bring btrfs into wider enterprise adoption—including working with Google to support it natively.</p>\n<p>I'll share the decision-making process, key performance and reliability insights, and the quirks you only discover when running btrfs at scale. Whether you're btrfs-curious or just love a good ops tale, you'll walk away with real-world takeaways—and maybe a newfound respect for this once-maligned filesystem.</p>\n<p>If you know what NTFS, ext4, or ZFS are, you’re ready for this journey.</p>",

This talk explores the intersection of technology, autonomy, and community within the unique context of transformational festivals, temporary autonomous zones (TAZs) (or future isolated neightborhoods and local communities?) where experimentation and reappropriation of tools take center stage.</p>\n<p>Starting from a cyberpunk reflection — <em>high tech, low life</em> — the talk questions how much of that dystopian vision has already become reality: from algorithmic control to the loss of privacy and digital dependency. Drawing on the legacy of radio as an anarchic medium and the new rise of mesh networks such as <strong>Meshtastic/Meshcore/Reticulum</strong>, <strong>The Things Network</strong>, and <strong>Helium</strong>, Davide Gomba connects past and future: from Marconi lighting up the Cristo Redentor in 1931 to today’s decentralized communication protocols.</p>\n<p>Through examples from <strong>Lutopia’s “Ozorian Experiment” (2024)</strong> and the ongoing <strong>Burning Mesh</strong> initiative, the talk presents how off-grid communication can become both a poetic and political act - reclaiming connection, rebuilding resilience, and teaching new forms of digital literacy. Between <strong>cyberpunk dystopia and techno-anarchic optimism</strong>, “The Meshiverse OR The Revolution of the Little Radios” is a manifesto for the right to communicate freely - even, and especially, when the network goes dark.</p>",

In addition to being a batteries-included framework that makes local-first state practical, Jazz uniquely solves local-first permissions, by coupling public-key cryptography with CRDTs in a way that allows for dynamic, expressive permission structures which can be defined on the client and are enforced globally, in an auditable way.</p>\n<p>Advice from the devroom managers: Don't miss this talk!

Kevin Jahns and the community have built something incredible — real-time sync, conflict resolution, offline editing, all handled elegantly. But integrating a powerful library is just the start. This talk is about what comes after.</p>\n<p>I'll cover the production challenges we solved building on top of Yjs, the crux of it would be around: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>Server-side edits — making backend mutations (AI, automations, database state sync in case of subdocuments) coexist with live client editing without users feeling out of sync</li>\n<li>Scaling the sync layer — infrastructure decisions for thousands of concurrent documents with awareness working as expected.</li>\n<li>Large document performance — what breaks when documents get massive, and how we fixed it without breaking our servers, horizontally scaling sticky ws connections.</li>\n<li>Version history — snapshots and visual diffs using StateVectors and the StructStore (deep-dive: palanikannan.com/blogs/version-history-and-snapshots-in-yjs) and what works at scale! </li>\n<li>Offline-first in practice — making \"syncs when you're back\" actually reliable, especially say when you open your tab that chrome killed due to inactivity :p</li>\n<li>Permissions and reacting to them in realtime, inline comments sync and so much more!</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Plane is <a href=\"github.com/makeplane/plane\">fully open source</a> with 38k+ stars and a vibrant OSS community.

Niko will first introduce the general architecture of our platform, engine, protocol and SDK, giving an overview of its components, and some details on the E2EE sync protocol, cryptographic capabilities/permissions/access control. We will show how we support any kind of CRDT, including Automerge and Yjs, and the CRDT for Graph database (RDF) that we have developed.</p>\n<p>Then Laurin will introduce the new ORM TypeScript SDK for <strong>NextGraph</strong> that turns document/database records into ordinary, typed objects with two‑way binding. By proxying those objects and emitting signals, the SDK provides a framework‑agnostic reactive layer that integrates cleanly with React, Vue, and Svelte. And more frameworks could be easily added in the future.</p>\n<p><strong>CRDT support</strong> - The SDK works with Yjs, Automerge, and, most notably, <strong>RDF</strong> - a graph data format designed for application interoperability. The SDK includes a converter that transforms <strong>SHEX</strong> shapes (an RDF schema language) into TypeScript type definitions for type safety.</p>\n<p><strong>Reactive POJOs</strong> - Objects are wrapped in a proxy, so any property change triggers a signal, which updates both the UI and sends a JSON patch to the backend. Signals provide an efficient, event‑driven mechanism for state propagation and have been gaining popularity in modern front‑end ecosystems.</p>\n<p><strong>You will see</strong> a live demo walking through a simple property change, showing how the mutation is instantly persisted to the local database, reflected in UI components across React, Vue, Svelte, and synchronized with the network across devices and user accounts.</p>",

The next generation brings reactivity to the data layer itself—letting applications stay in sync with the backend automatically through a sync-engine architecture.</p>\n<p>This talk explores how <a href=\"https://tanstack.com/db\">TanStack DB</a> provides a practical path toward such architectures without requiring a rewrite or commitment to a particular backend. You can start with familiar API-driven workflows using <a href=\"https://tanstack.com/query\">TanStack Query</a> and progressively adopt richer sync through <a href=\"https://electric-sql.com/\">Electric</a> or any real-time backend. TanStack DB acts as the connective tissue: a unified, fast, reactive client database that keeps application state synchronized with your backend.</p>\n<p>The focus of this presentation is TanStack DB’s newest capability: query-driven sync. Instead of preloading large collections or keeping oversized in-memory datasets, TanStack DB loads exactly the data a query needs—whether that’s a page of results, a slice of a document, or a relational join. Under the hood, an incremental view-maintenance engine built on differential dataflow ensures queries update efficiently as new data arrives.</p>\n<p>This enables applications to handle larger data volumes, compute reactive queries efficiently, and move toward a true sync-engine architecture—without sacrificing the incremental adoption story that makes TanStack DB practical for real-world teams.</p>",

We'll also showcase <a href=\"https://github.com/p2panda/reflection\">Reflection</a>, our GTK-based text editor, and <a href=\"https://p2panda.org/\">p2panda</a>, the underlying peer-to-peer stack.</p>\n<p>Modal is a new collective dedicated to development, design, organizing, policy campaigning, and more, to make computing more useful, secure, and resilient. Our work centeres around software infrastructure projects, including GNOME, postmarketOS, p2panda, systemd, and the Linux kernel. We aim to make it simple to sync data across your devices while providing easy-to-use local-first APIs for applications. By doing this, we're creating an ecosystem of free software apps that leverage this infrastructure for synchronization and real-time collaboration. The foundation of all this technology is the p2panda project, which is built with \"walkaway\" principles in mind. p2panda's modular networking stack allows applications to operate autonomously on a wide variety of infrastructures—whether it's the Internet, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi Direct / Aware, or even sneakernet - giving you flexibility and control over how and when your devices sync.</p>\n<p>p2panda aims to provide everything you need to build modern, privacy-respecting and secure local-first applications. Over five years of research, testing, exploration and collaboration with other teams, we've identified emergent patterns which have been solidified in p2panda's \"building blocks\". We'll present an overview of the peer-to-peer problem space and describe how each of our modules are designed to provide Connectivity, Discovery, Sync, Encryption, Access Control, and more.</p>\n<p>We'll showcase concrete software built around Modal and p2panda, including Reflection, our native, GTK-based text editor. Reflection not only serves as a real-world example of a local-first application, but also as a \"template\" for developers looking to build similar apps. Alongside Reflection, we're developing a GObject interface for common p2p primitives, wrapped around p2panda and UI components. This interface aims to simplify the process of integrating decentralized networking into applications.</p>\n<p>Finally, we'll discuss our work on a system service designed to enhance applications with p2p features, enabling a unified user experience at the OS level. This system service manages key tasks like permissions for networking activity, node trust management, multi-device support, and identity management through the address book. It is agnostic to any specific p2p framework, which we hope will foster greater interoperability across different platforms and p2p technologies in the future.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Files on your hard drive are the ultimate local-first storage. But to allow real-time collaboration from within text editors, developers currently have to reinvent the wheel each time: Figure out how to hook into buffer changes correctly, implement displaying remote cursors, finding a way to get the required events in and out of the editor.</p>\n<p>In addition, for each combination of editor and collaborative use-case, there needs to be a separate plugin: For example, there is a Vim plugin to connect to an Etherpad, or you need individual editor plugins when wanting to live-code music or visuals together.</p>\n<p>Similar problems have already been solved by different editor-facing protocols: To integrate \"language intelligence\" tools (that provide autocompletion or refactorings), you can use the Language Server Protocol (LSP). Likewise, debugging support can be added via the Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP), and support for LLM tooling is now provided via the Model Context Protocol (MCP).</p>\n<p>We think that there's a gap for a \"Collaborative Editing Protocol\" (CEP, working title) that allows text editors to talk to \"collaboration servers\", and thus provides them with collaboration functionality. Per editor, this protocol would only need to be implemented once, making the resulting software components interoperable. You'd have plugins for Neovim and for Emacs that speak CEP, and you'd have an Etherpad bridge that also speaks it, and you could use all of them together!</p>\n<p>In this talk, we want to outline the requirements for a protocol like that. We'll discuss different approaches, and demonstrate the proof-of-concept protocol we built for our local-first peer-to-peer pair programming software \"Teamtype\". We're looking to form a group to iterate on a \"collaboration protocol\" together, and eventually standardize it!</p>",

SQLRooms can run entirely in the browser using DuckDB-WASM, or connect to a shared session-backend running native DuckDB for larger datasets—in both cases, enabling privacy-preserving analytics where data stays under user control.</p>\n<p>In this talk, I'll present SQLRooms' local-first architecture and our ongoing work on real-time collaboration using <a href=\"https://loro.dev\">Loro CRDT</a>. We're building a Canvas module with SQL query cells and <a href=\"https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/\">Vega-Lite</a> visualization cells, a Notebooks module, and an underlying DAG (directed acyclic graph) engine that tracks dependencies between cells—automatically re-executing downstream cells when data changes. These modules will support collaborative editing via <code>@sqlrooms/crdt</code>, with sync enabled through WebSockets using <a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/sqlrooms-duckdb-server/\">sqlrooms-duckdb-server</a>.</p>\n<p>A key insight for analytics apps: DuckDB serves as a read-only query engine—the underlying data doesn't need to be synced. Only the UI state requires CRDT synchronization: queries, notebooks, canvas layouts, annotations, and comments. This CRDT state can be persisted both in a shared session-backend DuckDB and on local machines for offline access.</p>\n<p>For session-backend deployments, sqlrooms-duckdb-server provides a shared DuckDB instance where all connected clients query the same data—useful for large datasets or when consistent results matter. This can be deployed with e.g. <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/containers/\">Cloudflare Containers</a> for on-demand, per-session instances.</p>\n<p>I'll discuss our choice of Loro over Yjs and how separating data (read-only DuckDB) from collaborative state (CRDT) simplifies the sync architecture while enabling privacy-preserving collaborative analytics.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Distributed systems replicate data to improve availability, scalability, and fault tolerance. Ensuring that replicas remain eventually consistent is difficult. Current practices advocate for the use of Replicated Data Types (RDTs) which guarantee convergence out-of-the-box, e.g. CRDTs. However, programming distributed systems using these RDTs is non-trivial due to the lack of appropriate abstractions for replica discovery, update propagation, etc.</p>\n<p>At our research lab at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel, we look at what it means for developers to build and utilise eventually consistent data types in their applications. The majority of current RDT approaches are ad-hoc, they require a dedicated implementation for each data type. However, building advanced collaborative applications requires custom RDTs that are tailored to the needs of the application. That implies extending or composing existing RDTs, or designing new ones.</p>\n<p>Our goal is to develop abstractions and methodologies for the systematic construction of applications requiring replicated state. In this talk, we particularly focus on two main aspects: (1) non-ad hoc approaches to efficient RDT implementations, and (2) simplifying the development of application-specific RDTs:</p>\n<p>Many approaches use ad-hoc solutions to track causality and ensure eventual convergence, e.g. keeping meta-data in the implementation. In a lot of cases, their design does not translate well into efficient implementations and is not suitable for resource-constrained runtimes. We present Flec[1, 2, 3], a framework that guides developers in making informed decisions during the development process, by providing an API that gives developers a uniform and structured way to deal with functional system requirements. This can range from network constraints to security and authorization aspects.</p>\n<p>To simplify the development of collaborative applications using RDTs, we investigate alternative approaches where RDTs can be automatically derived from their sequential implementation [4, 5]. By means of an analysis we can detect conflicting operations, and automatically derive functional CRDTs. In some datatypes, certain application invariants would be impossible to guarantee with CRDTs. For these cases, we support automatically detecting where an application would have to synchronise and output an RDT with mixed consistency.  </p>\n<p>[1] Jim Bauwens, 2024.

    "abstract": "<p>Willow (https://willowprotocol.org) is a family of publicly-funded, open source peer-to-peer storage protocols.</p>\n<p>These protocols are designed to let you run your own independent digital spaces where you can share and collaborate on data with groups big and small. These digital spaces are stored on your own hardware, cutting out unwanted third parties. Only devices which have been given explicit consent to store data can receive it. Any kind of data can be stored, organised in a manner similar to files and folders. And data can travel between devices in many different ways, so you can choose the appropriate avenue, whether that's the internet or a USB key.</p>\n<p>In this talk we will introduce our protocols: Willow, Meadowcap, Drop Format, and Confidential Sync, and what makes them different to other systems in the local-first ecosystem. We will also talk about our Rust implementations of these specifications (https://codeberg.org/worm-blossom/willow_rs), and how we are bringing torrent-like payload transfer to Willow using Bab (https://worm-blossom.github.io/bab/).</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Abstract:\nThe Opulent Voice Protocol (OVP) is an open-source digital voice protocol designed for bandwidth-constrained radio communications, including satellite and terrestrial amateur radio links. Developed through the peer-reviewed research and development process at Open Research Institute, OVP addresses the critical need for high-quality voice communication protocols that are freely implementable without licensing restrictions.</p>\n<p>Built around the 16 kbps Opus voice codec, OVP delivers superior voice quality that exceeds existing amateur digital voice modes while seamlessly integrating voice, keyboard chat, and data in a unified protocol. This eliminates the need for separate, clunky packet data modes. This talk will explore OVP's architecture, performance characteristics, and design trade-offs. The first implementation target for the modem is the PLUTO SDR and can be found here https://github.com/OpenResearchInstitute/pluto_msk</p>\n<p>Key Technical Features in the Reference Implementation:\nMinimum shift keying modulation has constant envelope and no phase discontinuities. Optimized for low SNR conditions, with forward error correction and flywheel synchronization. Efficient bandwidth utilization suitable for 70 cm and above amateur bands. Current hardware implementation on FPGA enables a future open source ASIC design. </p>\n<p>We'll cover:\nThe architectural decisions behind OVP's design, showing how domain modeling of the radio channel shaped protocol choices. Audio quality comparisons between OVP and legacy digital voice modes. The integrated communication model, which allows voice, chat, and data to coexist in a single protocol. Performance analyses. Integration with existing SDR platforms and open-source radio stacks. Lessons learned from deploying OVP over the air. The peer-review process and how open collaboration improved the protocol. </p>\n<p>Human-radio interface project is here: https://github.com/OpenResearchInstitute/interlocutor\nProcessor-side codebase (Xilinx/AMD 7010 Zynq) is here: https://github.com/OpenResearchInstitute/dialogus\nSatellite simulator is here: https://github.com/OpenResearchInstitute/locus</p>\n<p>This talk is relevant to anyone interested in software-defined radio, open hardware communications systems, space technology, or building robust protocols for constrained environments.</p>",

Despite their long communication range, the need for bulky antennas and low VLF noise environment makes the direct reception of these signals impractical.

    "abstract": "<p>The Parks-McClellan (Remez) algorithm is a filter design algorithm that is optimal in the sense that it minimizes the maximum error between the desired and realized transfer functions. Many implementations of this algorithm exist, including in GNU Radio and SciPy. However, some of these have issues such as numerical stability for some filter design problems. I will give a summary of the Remez algorithm, why there are different possible implementations, and why some may be better than others. I will also explain how to use this algorithm for some practical filter design problems. The talk is intended partly as publicity for the <a href=\"https://github.com/maia-sdr/pm-remez/\">pm-remez</a> Python/Rust modern implementation by the speaker and partly as a tutorial on filter design.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>White Rabbit (WR) is a digital synchronization protocol over Gb Ethernet whose development is centralized by CERN with contributions from high energy physics communities including accelerators and detectors. The sub-ns synchronization capability provided by WR makes it well suited for distributed-SDR system synchronization, but the phase detection mechanism requires two tunable oscillators hardly found in generic FPGA boards. Thanks to the advances of FPGA internal clocking circuitry, WR has been demonstrated to run on generic boards not fitted with these peripherals: we demonstrate WR synchronization of the (low cost) AcornCLE215 board and Enjoy Digital's M2SDR board with some limitations over the dedicated hardware and induced by the AD936x RF frontent.</p>",

Initially dedicated to GNSS signal reception, two such chips clocked by a common frequency reference can be used for passive radar or direction of arrival measurements.\nIn this presentation, we tackle the challenges of PLL setpoint drift leading to phase variations despite the common clock, the impact of low ADC resolution on the recorded signal characteristics, and on correlation calculation. These results are not confined to this particular chip, but valid for any low SNR recordings, including for radioastronomical measurement systems. We demonstrate the use of this setup on passive radar measurements using various ground based and spaceborne sources of opportunity.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Over the past two decades, Plan 9 has seen many improvements and contributions and been made accessible on modern hardware by projects such as 9front. While appealing for certain tasks, audio processing has not been in the spotlight much. Despite the many ports and tools now available, information about them is splintered across many websites and code repositories and it can be difficult to piece together the overall picture. In particular, Plan 9 typically isn't known for music production, yet while it cannot approach the feature set of modern digital audio workstations (DAWs) on other systems, it is quite capable. This talk will explore the topic of audio processing on Plan 9 from a musician's perspective, show what can be done currently, and discuss its limitations and needs. Basic knowledge of Plan 9 is assumed. Topics covered: driver support, decoding/encoding, audio players, recording and editing, visualization, MIDI tools, trackers, synthesis, production.</p>",

One of those concepts that we have been test-driving for about a decade was the <em>quota-aware CPU scheduling</em>, which combined CPU-quota trading with priority-based scheduling. However, with Sculpt OS as a major use case of Genode as a desktop OS that focuses on dynamic workloads, it was time to rethink what we expect from a kernel's CPU scheduler.</p>\n<p>In this talk, Johannes Schlatow and Stefan Kalkowski share the story and lessons learned from re-designing and re-implementing the kernel scheduler with a particular focus on fairness, tunable latency and ease of configuration.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>As kernels manage hardware, in certain cases the only way to prevent race conditions in kernel code is to disable interrupts. This is a kernel way of granting code exclusive access to resources at lowest levels.</p>\n<p>In the realm of embedded devices, it is often not feasible to keep interrupts disabled for prolonged period of time. This affects the design of portions of the kernel which modify data structures accessible from within interrupt context. Despite very limited API offered by the kernel to interrupt handlers, this still affects key data structures in kernel - scheduler table and notification table. This in turn means that any use of threading or notification API would require interrupts to be disabled for potentially prolonged time periods.</p>\n<p>To avoid prolonged periods of disabled interrupts we went for some inspiration into the land of lock-free and wait-free programming. We took basic primitives used in lock-free programming and modified them to avoid excessive overhead such primitives have. The resulting mechanism is not lock-free anymore yet offers semantics which allows us to lock (disable interrupts) for much shorter and well predictable periods of time. </p>\n<p>The resulting mechanism resembles database transactions to certain extent. This talk will provide introduction to the transaction subsystem, reason on why it offers benefits over raw locks and elaborate on the topic \"How not to loose your hair while trying to work with ever-changing data consistently\".</p>",

Everything is built around message passing, from process launches and virtual memory operations, to driver events and GUI updates.</p>\n<p>axle OS lacks a GPU driver, but features a compositing desktop window manager with transparency effects and animations. Since the compositor runs on the CPU, I’ve put significant effort into making redraws as efficient and targeted as possible to create a smooth and responsive experience.</p>\n<p>In this talk, I’ll give a tour of axle’s CPU-bound compositor from first principles. We’ll go on a journey of live visualisations, seeing how each successive optimization allows the compositor to perform progressively less work per frame, building up towards a general strategy for redraws that comprehensively covers screen updates.</p>\n<p>Developing a compositor that plays optimisation tricks involves lots of testing, which can be onerous in an OS that’s primarily developed in an emulator and which must boot itself before the compositor can run. Therefore, we’ll also take a look at a host-side userspace harness I made for the compositor: the compositor can run on my host-native macOS, or as a part of the full axle OS distribution. I developed a simulator which allows me to record user interaction (such as dragging a window around with a mouse), capture the composited frames, and write a test suite that replays these events and ensures the composited frames don’t deviate from the correct output.</p>\n<p>We’ll investigate R-trees, different compositing strategies, client request rate limiting, and the various types of redraws that the compositor must be able to handle. This talk aims to be an engaging and ‘interactive’ experience for the audience, with lots of guiding visualisations motivating each optimization we make to our compositor, following the journey towards axle OS’s contemporary CPU compositor.</p>",

Some SMP support has been added, which should allow at least compilation to be run in parallel. Hurd support was added to the rust ecosystem, which became more and more a necessity due to various software now requiring it. The x86_64 port is essentially complete, which mostly required fixing the MIG RPC layer, and telling various software that it exists. To bootstrap the Debian GNU/Hurd x86_64 distribution, many of the crossbuilding, rebootstrapping and build profiles tools were used to make it relatively smooth. Additionally, the Guix/Hurd distribution is also on its way, as well as an Alpine/Hurd distribution.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Since the first Microkernel OS Devroom at FOSDEM 2012 and culminating today, there have been exactly 15 devrooms in 15 years dedicated to microkernel-based operating systems at each FOSDEM. As surprising or shocking this may sound to somebody who has been there all along, this time period already constitutes a small piece of history. While the computing world of today is not dramatically different or unrecognizable compared to 2012, maybe except for a few \"minor\" technologies such as HTML5 and LLMs ;), there have definitively been some changes and shifts of priorities.</p>\n<p>Let us take this opportunity for a small retrospective of the last 15 years in the context of open-source microkernel-based operating systems. What problems have we been facing back then and how do they relate to the problems we face today? What have been the ups and downs? What are the important lessons learned?</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>In scientific computing on supercomputers, performance should be king.\nToday’s rapidly diversifying High-Performance Computing (HPC) landscape makes this increasingly difficult to achieve however...</p>\n<p>Modern supercomputers rely heavily on open source software, from a Linux-based operating system to scientific applications and their vast dependency stacks. A decade ago, HPC systems were relatively homogeneous: Intel CPUs, a fast interconnect like Infininand, and a shared filesystem. Today, diversity is the norm: AMD and Intel CPUs, emerging Arm-based exascale systems like <a href=\"https://hackmd.io/LXZmuTDdTJi-cQKkG6AZ-w\">JUPITER</a>, widespread acceleration with NVIDIA and AMD GPUs, soon also RISC-V system architectures (like <a href=\"https://tenstorrent.com/\">Tenstorrent</a>), etc.</p>\n<p>This hardware fragmentation creates significant challenges for researchers and HPC support teams. Getting scientific software installed reliably and efficiently is more painful than ever, and that’s before even considering software performance.</p>\n<p>Containers, once heralded as the solution for mobility-of-compute, are increasingly showing their limits. An x86_64 container image is useless on a system with Arm CPUs, and will be equally useless on RISC-V in the not so distant future. What's worse is that portable container images used today already sacrifice performance by avoiding CPU-specific instructions like AVX-512 or AVX10, potentially leaving substantial performance gains on the table. Containerization also complicates MPI-heavy workloads and introduces friction for HPC users.</p>\n<p>This talk introduces the <a href=\"https://eessi.io/\"><strong>European Environment for Scientific Software Installations (EESSI)</strong></a>, which tackles these challenges head-on with a fundamentally different approach. EESSI is a curated, performance-optimized scientific software stack powered by open source technologies including <a href=\"https://cernvm.cern.ch/fs\">CernVM-FS</a>, <a href=\"https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:Prefix\">Gentoo Prefix</a>, <a href=\"https://easybuild.io/\">EasyBuild</a>, <a href=\"https://lmod.readthedocs.io\">Lmod</a>, <a href=\"https://computecanada.github.io/magic_castle/\">Magic Castle</a>, <a href=\"https://reframe-hpc.readthedocs.io\">ReFrame</a>, etc.</p>\n<p>We will show how EESSI enables researchers to use the same optimized software stack seamlessly across laptops, cloud VMs, supercomputers, CI pipelines, and even Raspberry Pis—without sacrificing performance or ignoring hardware differences. This unlocks powerful workflows and simplifies software management across heterogeneous environments.</p>\n<p>EESSI is already being adopted across <a href=\"https://www.eessi.io/docs/systems/\">European supercomputers</a> and plays a central role in the upcoming <a href=\"https://my-eurohpc.eu\">EuroHPC Federation Platform</a>.</p>\n<p>Come learn why EESSI is the right way to keep the P in HPC.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Slow performance is often a major blocker of new visionary applications in scientific computing and related fields, regardless of whether it is embedded or distributed computing. This issue is becoming more and more challenging to tackle as it is no longer enough to do only algorithmic optimisations, only hardware optimisations, or only (operating) system optimisations: all of them need to be considered together.</p>\n<p>Architecting full-stack computer systems customised for a use case comes to the rescue, namely software-system-hardware co-design. However, doing this manually per use case is cumbersome as the search space of possible solutions is vast, the number of different programming models is substantial, and experts from various disciplines need to be involved. Moreover, performance analysis tools often used here are fragmented, with state-of-the-art programs tending to be proprietary and not compatible with each other.</p>\n<p>This is why automated full-stack system design is promising, but the existing solutions are few and far between and do not scale. <strong>Adaptyst is an open-source project at CERN (the world-leading particle physics laboratory) aiming to solve this problem. It is meant to be a comprehensive architecture-agnostic tool which:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>unifies performance analysis across the entire software-hardware stack by calling state-of-the-art software and APIs under the hood with any remaining gaps bridged by Adaptyst (so that performance can be inspected both macro- and microscopically regardless of the workflow and platform type)</li>\n<li>suggests automatically the best solutions of workflow performance bottlenecks in terms of one or more of: software optimisations, hardware choices and/or customisations, and (operating) system design</li>\n<li>scales easily from embedded to high-performance/distributed computing and allows adding support for new software/system/hardware components seamlessly by anyone thanks to the modular design</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The tool is in the early phase of development with small workforce and concentrating on profiling at the moment. Given that Adaptyst has broad application potential and we want it to be for everyone’s benefit, we are building an open-source community around the project.</p>\n<p>This talk is an invitation to join us: we will explain the performance problems we face at CERN, tell you in detail what Adaptyst is and how you can get involved, and demonstrate the current version of the project live on CPU and CUDA examples.</p>\n<p>Project website: https://adaptyst.web.cern.ch</p>",

The creation of the TPC, a non-profit organization that defines standard benchmarks and supervises their use through rigorous audits, spelled an end to the benchmark wars and helped drive innovation on performance in relational database management systems.</p>\n<p>TPC served as a model for defining database benchmarks, including the Linked Data Benchmark Council (LDBC, https://ldbc.org/), of which I've been a contributor and board member for the past 5+ years. Through LDBC's workloads, graph database systems have seen a 25× speedup in four years and a 71× price-performance improvement on transactional workloads.</p>\n<p>Defining database benchmarks requires a careful balancing of multiple aspects: relevance, portability, scalability, and simplicity. Most notably, the field in the last few years has shifted toward using simpler, leaderboard-style benchmarks that skip the rigorous auditing process but allow quick iterations.</p>\n<p>In this talk, I will share my lessons learned on designing database benchmarks and using them in practice.

Parsing routines for it exist in every modern programming languages, either built-in, or included in popular libraries such as <a href=\"https://rapidjson.org/\">RapidJSON</a> for C++ or <a href=\"https://docs.rs/json/latest/json/\">json</a> for Rust.</p>\n<p>The task of conversion between JSON strings and <a href=\"https://lua.org/\">Lua</a> objects has been solved plenty of times before, but either the solutions are not focused on performance, or the parsers are too strict for the \"relaxed\" format we use at <a href=\"https://www.beamng.com/game/\">BeamNG</a>.</p>\n<p>What if we want to have the fastest Lua table &lt;-&gt; relaxed JSON conversion possible? We came up with a highly optimized LuaJIT code we use for handling JSONs at [BeamNG] since a few years. But there is a way to go further - hacking on the C source code of the interpreter itself to add compiled built-in JSON support. How much extra performance can we squeeze out by going a level deeper?</p>\n<p>Get ready for juicy benchmarks and an optimization story from a real usage perspective.</p>",

    "url": "https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/FGMRSG-a_performance_comparison_of_kubernetes_multi-cluster_networking/",
    "abstract": "<p>Driven by application, compliance, and end-user requirements, companies opt to deploy multiple Kubernetes clusters across public and private clouds. However, deploying applications in multi-cluster environments presents distinct challenges, especially managing the communication between the microservices spread across clusters. Traditionally, custom configurations, like VPNs or firewall rules, were required to connect such complex setups of clusters spanning the public cloud and on-premise infrastructure.\nThis talk presents a comprehensive analysis of network performance characteristics for three popular open-source multi-cluster networking solutions (namely, <a href=\"https://skupper.io/\">Skupper</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/submariner-io/submariner\">Submariner</a> and <a href=\"https://istio.io/\">Istio</a>), addressing the challenges of microservices connectivity across clusters. We evaluate key factors such as latency, throughput, and resource utilization using established tools and benchmarks, offering valuable insights for organizations aiming to optimize the network performance of their multi-cluster deployments. Our experiments revealed that each solution involves unique trade-offs in performance and resource efficiency: Submariner offers low latency and consistency, Istio excels in throughput with moderate resource consumption, and Skupper stands out for its ease of configuration while maintaining balanced performance.</p>",

We'll begin by revealing why traditional API testing missed critical browser issues that only emerged at scale. Next, we'll demonstrate our open-source tool that uses Playwright to run thousands of real browsers, measuring React-specific metrics like component render times, memory leaks, and state management bottlenecks. Finally, we'll share the optimization journey that reduced browser memory and enabled true production readiness, ensuring our React application performs flawlessly for enterprise customers.</p>",

    "abstract": "<h3>Short Abstraction</h3>\n<p>The Entity-Component-System (ECS) architecture underpins many modern game engines and real-time simulation frameworks. Rust, with its strong guarantees around memory safety and concurrency, offers a powerful foundation for building high-performance game systems. This talk explores ECS in practice using the open-source Bevy game engine as a real-world case study. We examine how Bevy structures entities, components, and gameplay systems, how Rust’s ownership model shapes engine design, and what practical trade-offs arise between performance, safety, and flexibility when building real-time games in Rust.</p>\n<h3>Long Description</h3>\n<p>ECS is often presented as a cleaner alternative to object-oriented game architecture, but its real advantages and limitations only become clear once you start building real gameplay systems and chasing frame-time budgets. Working with ECS in Rust makes these trade-offs especially visible, because the compiler forces you to be explicit about data access, ownership, and parallel execution.</p>\n<p>This presentation uses the open-source Bevy game engine as a practical example of ECS in a modern game engine. I will walk through how gameplay systems are actually built using entities, components, and systems: spawning and querying entities, structuring game logic as systems, scheduling and ordering those systems, and how archetypes impact cache locality and frame performance. We will look at how Rust’s borrow checker directly shapes ECS API design, how safe parallel system execution works in practice, and where you sometimes need to rethink data layout to satisfy both the compiler and real-time performance constraints.</p>\n<p>Rather than treating ECS as a universal solution, this talk focuses on real development experience: what works extremely well for gameplay programming in Rust, what takes time to adjust to coming from traditional engines, and when ECS is the right architectural choice for a game versus when it adds unnecessary complexity. While the examples focus on games, the same ideas naturally extend to simulations, tools, and other real-time, data-driven applications</p>\n<h3>Links</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://bevy.org/\">Bevy Engine Homepage</a>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy\">Bevy Engine Github</a></p>",

    "abstract": "<p>The talk covers an evolution of widget toolkits, which have been started 40 years ago along with the historical changes in a desktop GUI. Widget toolkits are reviewed from three points of view: architecture, user experience, and programming principles. More than 90% of historically significant widget toolkits have open source licenses: some are opensourced after decrease of their commercial demand (like OpenLook and Motif), others are developed as a part of FLOSS world (TCL/TK, GTK+, QT) or in systems cloned by the open source community (GnuSTEP, Haiku OS, etc.).</p>\n<p>Reviewed toolkits of 1980s include early Unix GUI of Andrew Toolkit and Project Athena, followed by OpenLook and Motif, and main non-Unix toolkits: WinAPI and NextSTEP GUI. Significant toolkits of 1990s include TCL/TK, wide range of wrapper toolkits including MFC and Java AWT and Swing, and the appearance of two main Linux widget libraries, GTK+ and QT. Also the burst of visual theming occurred in the second half of 1990s is examined for Unix and Windows platforms (as in their artistic styles, so in used architectural approaches). The list of milestones is finished with the Apple Cocoa style, closing the XX century experiments (but theming efforts had 10 more years of boiling). From the architecture point of view, the talk covers the recurring efforts in the event processing techniques,  targeting at hiding callbacks from a GUI developer with available object-style metaphors.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>The Neo Geo, the classic cartridge-based arcade and home video game system turned 35 in 2025. By now, it has been thoroughly reverse-engineered and documented online. Recently, there has been a surge in homebrew demos and newly published homebrew games for the Neo Geo. And although development in 2026 is way easier than it was in the 90's, too many available tools are still GUI-only, closed-source or Windows-only binaries, which leaves a lot to be desired. ngdevkit [1] was born out of this observation. The ambition of this project is twofold: first, to be a fully open source, easy to use development kit; second, to prove that your entire game development workflow can rely exclusively on open source software for compiling code, creating graphics, composing chiptunes, designing sound FX...</p>\n<p>This talk will give an overview of C programming for the Neo Geo with ngdevkit, and will discuss the main components of this open source development kit. ngdevkit provides a toolchain that leverages binutils, GCC, newlib and SDCC for code compilation, GnGeo or Mame for code execution, and GDB for source-level debugging. It also comes with an open source reimplementation of the original Neo Geo BIOS, with full ABI compatibility. In addition, this development kit provides the necessary crt0 and runtime to boot the game processor (68k) and the sound processor (Z80), and uses a custom linkscript to expose hardware features (video RAM, backup RAM, memory mapped registers, I/O state) as regular C variables. At last, it provides the first fully open source sound driver and chiptune player on the Neo Geo hardware. Throughout the talk, we will discuss how ngdevkit was made possible thanks to a vast trove of public domain documentation and a vast collection of open source software.</p>\n<p>[1] https://ngdevkit.dev</p>",

We will show, including using the stepping mode, how it deals with programs and data using separate \"RAM\" drums (Harvard-style) and carries out computations with a high-precision floating-point calculation unit. You will discover the not-so-odd instruction set, coding style and how complex functions required for applications in ballistics and thermodynamics were implemented as a specific library. In addition to releasing the simulator as Open Source, the NAM-IP museum also publicly archived the available technical documentation.</p>",

Advances in AI-driven supercomputing — specialized tensor accelerators, AI compiler stacks, and novel distributed systems — offer unprecedented computational power. Yet, scientific applications such as ocean models, often written in Fortran, C++, or Julia and built for traditional HPC, remain largely incompatible with these technologies. This gap hampers performance portability and isolates scientific computing from rapid cloud-based innovation for AI workloads.</p>\n<p>In this talk we present <a href=\"https://github.com/EnzymeAD/Reactant.jl\"><code>Reactant.jl</code></a>, a free and open-source optimising compiler framework for the Julia programming language, based on MLIR and XLA. <code>Reactant.jl</code> preserves high-level semantics (e.g. linear algebra operations), enabling aggressive cross-function, high-level optimisations, and generating efficient code for a variety of backends (CPU, GPU, TPU and more). Furthermore, <code>Reactant.jl</code> combines with <a href=\"https://enzyme.mit.edu/\">Enzyme</a> to provide high-performance multi-backend automatic differentiation.</p>\n<p>As a practical demonstration, we will show the integration of <code>Reactant.jl</code> with <a href=\"https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl\"><code>Oceananigans.jl</code></a>, a state-of-the-art GPU-based ocean model. We show how the model can be seamlessly retargeted to thousands of distributed TPUs, unlocking orders-of-magnitude increases in throughput.

Yet, deploying them on high-performance computing (HPC) systems — where SLURM reigns as the dominant batch scheduler — remains fraught with challenges. This talk recounts the development of the official SLURM plugin for Snakemake (https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.29032.3; https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16922261), a journey shaped less by code and more by the idiosyncrasies of HPC environments. From GPU and MPI support to threaded applications, the plugin had to accommodate diverse computational needs — but the real hurdles lay in administrative policies: login nodes off-limits, partition naming chaos, and cluster-specific layouts and policies that defy standardization. I’ll share how the plugin evolved to accommodate the needs of data analysts - from Santa Cruz to Okinawa, from Stellenbosch to Uppsala. Whether you’re a bioinformatician or analyse CERN data, are a workflow developer, or HPC admin, this talk offers a look at the messy, human side of making reproducibility work in real-world HPC landscapes.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Wherever research software is developed and used, it needs to be installed, tested in various ways, benchmarked, and set up within complex workflows. Typically, in order to perform such tasks, either individual solutions are implemented - imposing significant restrictions due to the lack of portability - or the necessary steps are performed manually by developers or users, a time-consuming process, highly susceptible to errors. Furthermore, particularly in the field of high-performance computing (HPC), where large amounts of data are processed and the computer systems used are unique worldwide, not only performance, scalability, and efficiency of the applications are important, but so are modern research software engineering (RSE) principles such as reproducibility, reusability, and documentation.</p>\n<p>With these challenges and requirements in mind, JUBE [1] (Jülich Benchmarking Environment) has been developed at the Jülich Supercomputing Centre (JSC), enabling automated and transparent scientific workflows. JUBE is a generic, lightweight, configurable environment to run, monitor and analyze application execution in a systematic way. It is a free, open-source software implemented in Python that operates on a \"definition-based\" paradigm where the “experiment” is described declaratively in a configuration file (XML or YAML). The JUBE engine is responsible for translating this definition into shell scripts, job submission files, and directory structures. Due to its standardized configuration format, it simplifies collaboration and usability of research software. JUBE also complements the Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) capabilities, leading to Continuous Benchmarking.</p>\n<p>To introduce and facilitate JUBE’s usage, the documentation includes a tutorial with simple and advanced examples, an FAQ page, a description of the command line interface, and a glossary with all accepted keywords [2]. In addition, a dedicated Carpentries course offers an introduction to the JUBE framework [3] (basic knowledge of the Linux shell and either XML or YAML are beneficial when getting started with JUBE). A large variety of scientific codes and standard HPC benchmarks have already been automated using JUBE and are also available open-source [4].</p>\n<p>In this presentation, an overview of JUBE will be provided, including its fundamental concepts, current status, and roadmap of future developments (external code contributions are welcome). Additionally, three illustrative use cases will be introduced to offer a comprehensive understanding of JUBE's practical applications:\n- benchmarking as part of the procurement of JUPITER, Europe’s first exascale supercomputer;\n- a complex scientific workflow for energy system modelling [5];\n- continuous insight into HPC system health by regular execution of applications, and the subsequent graphical presentation of their results.</p>\n<p>JUBE is a well-established software, which has already been used in several national and international projects and on numerous and diverse HPC systems [6-13]. Besides being available via EasyBuild [14] and Spack [15], further software has been built up based on JUBE [16,17]. Owing to its broad scope and range of applications, JUBE is likely to be of interest to audiences in the HPC sector, as well as those involved in big data and data science.</p>\n<p>[1] https://github.com/FZJ-JSC/JUBE\n[2] https://apps.fz-juelich.de/jsc/jube/docu/index.html\n[3] https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/hpc-workflows-jube/\n[4] https://github.com/FZJ-JSC/jubench\n[5] https://elib.dlr.de/196232/1/2023-09_UNSEEN-Compendium.pdf\n[6] MAX CoE: https://max-centre.eu/impact-outcomes/key-achievements/benchmarking-and-profiling/\n[7] RICS2: https://risc2-project.eu/?p=2251\n[8] EoCoE: https://www.eocoe.eu/technical-challenges/programming-models/\n[9] DEEP: https://deep-projects.eu/modular-supercomputing/software/benchmarking-and-tools/\n[10] DEEP-EST: https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/754304/reporting\n[11] IO-SEA: https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/955811/results\n[12] EPICURE: https://epicure-hpc.eu/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/EPICURE-BEST-PRACTICE-GUIDE-Power-measurements-in-EuroHPC-machines_v1.0.pdf\n[13] UNSEEN: https://juser.fz-juelich.de/record/1007796/files/UNSEEN_ISC_2023_Poster.pdf\n[14] EasyBuild: https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs/tree/develop/easybuild/easyconfigs/j/JUBE\n[15] Spack: https://packages.spack.io/package.html?name=jube\n[16] https://github.com/edf-hpc/unclebench\n[17] https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3733723.3733740</p>",

    "abstract": "<h2>Content</h2>\n<p>High-frequency wave simulations in 3D (with e.g. Finite Elements) involve systems with hundreds of millions unknowns (up to 600M in our runs), prompting the use of massively parallel algorithms. In the harmonic regime, we favor Domain Decomposition Methods (DDMs) where local problems are solved in smaller regions (subdomains) and the full solution of the PDE is recovered iteratively. This requires each rank to own a portion of the mesh and to have a view on neighboring partitions (ghost cells or <em>overlaps</em>). In particular, the <em>Optimized Restricted Additive Schwarz</em> algorithm requires assembling matrices at the boundary of overlaps, which requires creating additional elements after the partitioning.</p>\n<p>During the last two years, I pushed our in-house FEM code (GmshFEM) to run increasingly large jobs, from 8 MPI ranks on a laptop, through local and national clusters, up to more than 30,000 ranks on LUMI. Each milestone provided its own challenges in the parallel implementation: as the problem size increases, simple global reductions can go from being a minor synchronization to being a major bottleneck, redundant information in partitioned meshes can eat hundreds of gigabytes of RAM, and load-balancing issues can become dominant.</p>\n<p>In this talk, I will describe how we tackled these challenges and how the future versions of Gmsh will take into account these issues. In particular, the next version of the MSH file format will be optimized to reduce data duplication across subdomains. I will also present the new API for querying information about partitioned meshes, such as retrieving elements in overlapping regions.</p>\n<h2>About Gmsh</h2>\n<p>Gmsh (https://gmsh.info/) is an open-source (GPL-2) finite element mesh generator widely used in scientific and engineering applications. It provides a graphical interface, a scripting language for automation, and language bindings (C/C++, Fortran, Python, Julia). In this work, Gmsh serves as the front-end mesh generator for large-scale distributed FEM simulations using our in-house solver GmshFEM (https://gitlab.onelab.info/gmsh/fem).</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>As the computing needs of the world have grown, the need for parallel systems has grown to match. However, the programming languages used to target those systems have not had the same growth.

Programmers must choose between parallel performance with low-level programming or productivity with high-level languages.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://chapel-lang.org/\">Chapel</a> is a programming language for productive parallel programming that scales from laptops to supercomputers. This talk will focus on the ways that Chapel addresses the above gap, giving programmers used to high level languages like Python access to distributed parallel performance. Chapel has long been open-source, but recently moved to become one of the many amazing projects hosted under the <a href=\"https://hpsf.io/\">High Performance Software Foundation</a>.</p>\n<p>The talk will include a description of Chapel and its performance as well as a few examples of Chapel programs.

    "abstract": "<p>With the rapid acceleration of ML/AI research in the last couple of years, the already energy-hungry HPC platforms have become even more demanding. A major part of this energy consumption is due to users’ workloads and it is only by the participation of end users that it is possible to reduce the overall energy consumption of the platforms. However, most of the HPC platforms do not provide any sort of metrics related to energy consumption, nor the performance metrics out of the box, which in turn do not encourage end users to optimize their workloads. </p>\n<p>The Compute Energy &amp; Emissions Monitoring Stack (CEEMS) has been designed to address this issue. CEEMS can report energy consumption and equivalent emissions of user workloads in real time for SLURM (HPC), Openstack (Cloud) and Kubernetes platforms alike.  It leverages the Linux perf subsystem and eBPF to monitor the performance metrics of the applications, which can help the end users to identify the bottlenecks in their workflows rapidly and consequently optimize them to reduce the energy and carbon footprint. CEEMS supports eBPF-based continuous profiling and it is the first monitoring stack to support continuous profiling on HPC platforms. Another advantage of CEEMS is that it can systematically monitor all the jobs on the platform without the end users having to modify their workflows or codes. </p>\n<p>Besides CPU energy usage, it supports reporting energy usage and performance metrics of workloads on NVIDIA and AMD GPU accelerators. CEEMS has been built around the prominent open-source tools in the observability ecosystem, like Prometheus and Grafana. CEEMS has been designed to be extensible and it allows the HPC center operators to easily define the energy estimation rules of user workloads based on the underlying hardware. CEEMS monitors I/O and network metrics in a file system agnostic manner, allowing it to work on any parallel file system used by HPC platforms. Finally, the talk will conclude by showing how CEEMS monitoring is used on the Jean-Zay HPC platform with more than 2000 nodes that have a daily job churn rate of around 20k jobs.</p>",

But traditional storage formats pose challenges for machine learning, big-data analytics, and on-demand workflows. </p>\n<p>We propose a solution which introduces a Zarr store implementation for creating virtual views of ECMWF’s Fields Database (FDB), enabling users to access GRIB data as if it were a native Zarr dataset. Unlike existing approaches such as VirtualiZarr or Kerchunk, our solution leverages the domain-specific MARS language to define virtual Zarr v3 stores directly from scientific requests, bridging GRIB and Zarr for dynamic, cloud-native access. </p>\n<p>This work is developed as part of the <a href=\"https://warmworld.de/\">WarmWorld Easier</a> project, aiming to make climate and weather data more interoperable and accessible for the scientific community. By combining the efficiency of FDB with the flexibility of Zarr, we unlock new possibilities for HPC, big-data analytics, and machine learning pipelines. </p>\n<p>In this talk, we will explore the architecture, discuss performance considerations, and demonstrate how virtual Zarr views accelerate integration in open-source workflows.</p>\n<p>This session will:\n    - Explain the motivation behind creating virtual Zarr views of ECMWF’s Fields Database. \n    - Detail the design and implementation of a custom Zarr Store that translates Zarr access patterns into MARS requests. \n    - Discuss performance trade-offs and scalability in HPC contexts. \n    - Showcase real-world examples of how this approach may support data science workflows, machine learning, and distributed computing.</p>",

It worked—but it wasn’t something we could easily rebuild from scratch or apply consistently to other parts of our infrastructure.</p>\n<p>As we designed our new HPC system (coming online in early 2026), we set ourselves a goal: treat the cluster as something we can declare and then recreate, not pet and nurture. The result is a “zero‑touch” style pipeline where a new node can go from “just racked” to “in SLURM and running jobs” with no manual intervention.</p>\n<p>In this talk, we walk through the end‑to‑end workflow:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>NetBox as DCIM and source of truth: racking a server and adding it to NetBox is the trigger; MACs, serials and IPs are automatically imported from vendor tools and IPAM/DNS into our automation.</li>\n<li>Using Tofu/Terragrunt (instead of Openstack's Heat orchestration service) to provision OpenStack/Ironic, SLURM infrastructure and network fabric across three environments (dev plus two interchangeable prod clusters for blue/green rollouts).</li>\n<li>Image‑based deployment with Packer and Ansible: we split roles into “install” and “configure”. Packages and heavy setup are baked into images, while an ansible-init service runs locally on first boot to apply configuration and join the cluster.</li>\n<li>Making nodes self‑sufficient, including fetching the secrets they need via short‑lived credentials and a minimal external dependency chain.</li>\n<li>The pitfalls: cloud‑init bugs in non‑standard setups, weirdness with multiple datasources and host types, and how we worked around them.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Come and see how we built a reproducible HPC/Big-Data cluster on open‑source tooling, reusing as much of the stack as possible for the rest of our infrastructure.</p>\n<p>About the speakers:\nÜmit Seren and Leon Schwarzäugl are HPC systems engineers at the Vienna BioCenter home to 3 life science institutes. Over the past years, they helped design, deploy and operate an OpenStack‑based HPC cluster and are now leading the automation and deployment architecture of the new HPC system coming online in 2026.

The advent of transformer models applied to this field brought very interesting scientific innovations, including the introduction of Protein Language Models (PLMs) and Antibody Language Models (AbLMs). The complexity of training or fine tuning PLMs/AbLMs along with inference tasks requires a non-trivial amount of GPU resources and a disciplined approach, where DevOps and MLOps methodologies fit very well. In this session we will present a series of tasks related to fine tuning PLMs/AbLMs for classification of SARS-CoV-2's spike proteins. We will highlight how Kubernetes can be used to execute large numbers of computationally intensive tasks on GPU hosts, including best practices for sharing Nvidia GPUs (MIG, Time Slicing, MPS) as part of an open source stack orchestrated with Apache Airflow. While these methodologies can be applied to any Kubernetes cluster, including on hyperscalers, this talk is meant to facilitate the (re)use of on-prem hardware infrastructure, presenting a fully open-source stack that can be easily deployed and maintained on bare metal.</p>\n<p>Source code:\nhttps://github.com/alexpilotti/bbk-mres\nhttps://github.com/alexpilotti/bbk-mres-airflow</p>\n<p>Overview of the scientific research made possible by this pipeline:\nhttps://cloudba.se/NeBzX</p>",

As these domains increasingly converge, ROCm™ is evolving into a more modular and flexible platform. Soon, the distribution model shifts to a core SDK with domain-specific add-ons—such as HPC—allowing users to select only the components they need. This reduces unnecessary overhead while maintaining a cohesive and interoperable stack.</p>\n<p>To support this modularity, AMD transitions to TheRock, an open-source build system that enables component-level integration, nightly and weekly builds, and streamlined delivery across the ROCm™ stack. TheRock is designed to handle the complexity of building and packaging ROCm™ in a way that’s scalable and transparent for developers. It plays a central role in how ROCm™ is assembled and delivered, especially as the platform moves toward more frequent and flexible release cycles.</p>\n<p>In this talk, we’ll cover the entire development and delivery pipeline—from the consolidation into three super-repos to how ROCm™ is built, tested, and shipped. This includes an overview of the development process, the delivery mechanism, TheRock’s implementation, and the testing infrastructure. We’ll also explain how contributors can engage with ROCm™—whether through code, documentation, or domain-specific enhancements—making it easier for developers to help shape the platform.</p>\n<p>Online resources\nTheRock: https://github.com/ROCm/TheRock \nrocm-libraries: https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-libraries \nrocm-systems: https://github.com/ROCm/rocm-systems </p>\n<p>Most projects are under MIT license.</p>\n<p>Speaker \nJP Lehr, Senior Member of Technical Staff, ROCm™ GPU Compiler, AMD</p>\n<p>© 2026 Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

    "abstract": "<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Spack is a flexible multi-language package manager for HPC, Data Science, and AI, designed to support multiple versions, configurations, and compilers of software on the same system. Since the last FOSDEM, the Spack community has reached a major milestone with the release of Spack v1.0, followed closely by v1.1. This talk will provide a comprehensive overview of the \"What's New\" in these releases, highlighting the changes that improve robustness, performance, and user experience. We will cover among other things the shift to modeling compilers as dependencies, the package repository split, and the new jobserver-aware parallel installer.</p>\n<h2>Description</h2>\n<p>With the release of Spack v1.0 in July 2025 and v1.1 in November 2025, the project has introduced significant architectural changes and new features requested by the community. In this talk, we will dive into the key features introduced across these releases:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Compilers as dependencies.</strong> Spack has fulfilled an old promise from FOSDEM 2018. Compilers are modeled as first-class dependencies, dependency resolution is more accurate, and binary distribution and ABI compatibility checks are more robust.</li>\n<li>The <strong>separation of the package repository</strong> from the core tool and the introduction of a versioned Package API allows users to pin the package repository version independently from Spack itself and enables regular package repository releases.</li>\n<li><strong>Parallel builds with a new user interface.</strong> Spack has a new scheduler that coordinates parallel builds using the POSIX jobserver protocol, allowing efficient resource sharing across all build processes. The decades-old jobserver protocol is experiencing a major renaissance, adopted recently by Ninja v1.13 (July 2025) and the upcoming LLVM 22 release. We’ll talk about how this enables composable parallelism across make, ninja, cargo, GCC, LLVM, Spack, and other tools.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Expected Prior Knowledge / Intended Audience</h2>\n<p>This talk is aimed at Research Software Engineers (RSEs), HPC system administrators, and Data Scientists who use or manage software stacks. Familiarity with Spack is helpful but not strictly required; the talk will be accessible to anyone interested in package management and software reproducibility in scientific computing.</p>\n<h2>Links</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Spack Website: https://spack.io</li>\n<li>Spack GitHub: https://github.com/spack/spack</li>\n<li>Spack Packages: https://github.com/spack/spack-packages</li>\n</ul>",

Since then, it has gained wide adoption across <a href=\"https://eessi.io/docs/systems/\">dozens of HPC systems</a> in Europe, being installed natively in EuroHPC systems and becoming a component within the <a href=\"https://my-eurohpc.eu/\">EuroHPC Federation Platform</a>. </p>\n<p>This session will highlight the progress EESSI has made, including the addition of new <a href=\"https://www.eessi.io/docs/software_layer/cpu_targets/\">CPU</a> and <a href=\"https://www.eessi.io/docs/software_layer/gpu_targets/\">GPU</a> targets, with broader support for modern computing technologies and much <a href=\"https://www.eessi.io/docs/available_software/overview\">more software</a>, featuring 600+ unique software projects (or over 3500 if you count individual Python packages and R libraries that are included) shipped with it. EESSI's capabilities have expanded significantly, turning it into a key service for managing and deploying software across a wide range of infrastructures.</p>\n<p>We will provide an overview of the current status of EESSI, focusing on its new capabilities, the integration with tools like <a href=\"https://spack.io/\">Spack</a> and <a href=\"https://www.openondemand.org/\">Open OnDemand</a>, as well as its growing software ecosystem. Through a live hands-on demo, we will showcase how EESSI is being used in real-world HPC environments and cloud systems, and discuss the future direction of the platform. Looking ahead, we will cover upcoming features and improvements that will continue to make EESSI a solid enabler for HPC software management in Europe and beyond.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>GPU vendors provide highly optimized libraries for math operations such as fast Fourier transformation or linear algebra (FFT, (sparse)BLAS/LAPACK, …) to perform those on devices.

While the presentation illustrates the use with the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), the feature is a generic feature of OpenMP 5.2, extended in 6.0, and is supported by multiple compilers.</p>\n<p><em>In terms of OpenMP features, the 'interop' directive provides the interoperability support, the 'declare variant' directive with the 'adjust_args' and 'append_args' clauses enable to write neater code; means for memory allocation and memory transfer and running code blocks on the GPU ('target' construct) complete the required feature set.</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <strong>OpenMP specification,</strong> current, past and future version, errata and example documents can be found at https://www.openmp.org/specifications/; a list of compilers and tools for OpenMP is at https://www.openmp.org/resources/openmp-compilers-tools/</li>\n<li><strong>GCC's OpenMP documentation</strong> is available at https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libgomp/ (API routines, implementation status, …) and, in particular, the supported interop foreign runtimes are documented at https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libgomp/Offload-Target-Specifics.html; GCC supports offloading to Nvidia and AMD GPUs.

To control them, you currently have a few options:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Use the vendor’s cloud service.\nThis approach has many problems: there is no interoperability between different vendors, so you end up installing 10 different cloud apps for 10 different devices; there are privacy concerns; and anything beyond the basics usually requires paid features.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Use an open-source platform such as Home Assistant, OpenHAB, Domoticz, FHEM, PiDome, or Majordomo.\nThese platforms are powerful but often too complex, time-consuming to learn, and relatively expensive to run—typically EUR 100+ and tens or even hundreds of hours of study.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Currently, there is no simple, easy-to-use, and low-cost solution on the market.</p>\n<p>We accepted this challenge and are now designing an open-source hardware solution running Free/Libre Open Source Software. Our goal is a device that costs around EUR 20 for the end user, offers more functionality than typical vendor cloud services, and remains fully open for modification and customization by anyone interested.</p>\n<p>After six months of work, we already have a functioning hardware prototype and software that supports basic features.</p>\n<p>In this presentation, I will discuss the challenges we encountered, demonstrate our current progress, and highlight the major obstacles we are facing.

    "abstract": "<p>The Electrical Rule Checks (ERC) in a CAD design software are a set of heuristic checks to help spotting potential mistakes in schematics.\nHowever, they have subtleties and quirks, which can lead people to fight against them instead of using them to their full potential.\nIn this talk, I will discuss some of the pain points I have experienced or have whitnessed people experience while using ERC, give some tips, and encourage people to use them and even try and improve them even more. It will be illustrated by a few real-life blunders that a good use of ERC could have prevented. TL;DR: I love ERC.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>A number of industrial applications now demand hard real-time scheduling capabilities from the kernel of a Linux-based operating system, but scheduling measurements from the system itself cannot be completely trusted as they are referenced to the same clock as the kernel-under-test. Yet, if the system can output signals to hardware as it runs, their timing can be analysed by an external microcontroller, and a second \"external\" measurement obtained to compare with the system's own report.</p>\n<p>Codethink wrote embedded Rust firmware to run on a Raspberry Pi Pico which analyses the timings of characters received on a UART serial port. On the other end of the serial port is our \"Rusty Worker\": a Rust program on a Linux system which uses the <code>sched_setattr</code> syscall to request that Linux schedules it with specified parameters, and then measures its own scheduling period and runtime. The single-threaded and interrupt-based architecture of this firmware allowed accurate external measurements of the Rusty Worker’s scheduling parameters at microsecond precision, and meant it was easy to extend to monitor the \"petting\" behaviour of a watchdog.</p>\n<p>Rust was a natural choice for the verification firmware and Rusty Worker. Higher level or interpreted languages would increase non-determinism and reduce our confidence in the accuracy of the collected timing data, whereas C or C++ programs risk undefined behaviour unacceptable in a safety-related context. Yet, Rust really came into its own with the relative simplicity of the cargo toolchain for embedded targets, so reproducibly building the firmware with a self-built toolchain (and without access to the internet) was just as straightforward as building the Rusty Worker for a Linux target.</p>\n<p>Having equipped our suite of bare-metal CI runners with KiCad-designed custom PCBs that feature a Raspberry Pi Pico and Debug Probe, we are able to run “soak” tests to collect thousands of self- and externally-measured deadline scheduling parameters for each iteration of our <a href=\"https://www.codethink.co.uk/ctrl-os.html\">Codethink Trustable Reproducible Linux (CTRL OS)</a>, as soon as engineers push a new commit. We then use the open source <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/CodethinkLabs/trustable/trustable\">Eclipse Trustable Software Framework (TSF)</a> to facilitate automatic “real time” aggregation and statistical analysis of the external scheduling measurements for each commit, clearly communicating the results and trends to senior stakeholders and junior engineers alike.</p>\n<p>TSF challenges us both to robustly, systematically, and continuously evidence our claims about Linux’s capabilities as a real-time operating system, and to scrutinise the software used for testing as strictly as the software under test. We are excited to share how we work towards these goals with external scheduling measurements and embedded Rust.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>CI/CD with Gerrit, AI-Enhanced Review, and Hardware-in-the-Loop Testing in Jenkins Pipelines\nThis presentation will explore advanced Continuous Integration (CI) strategies essential for open-source embedded systems development, moving beyond standard software testing to encompass physical hardware validation. We will begin by establishing the necessity of integrating rigorous unit and integration testing directly into the development workflow, demonstrating how to effectively define these steps within Jenkins Declarative Pipelines (DSL). The core of our approach involves deep integration with Gerrit Code Review, ensuring that tests and static analysis are triggered automatically upon every patch set creation, providing fast feedback to developers.\nA significant portion of the talk will focus on achieving true end-to-end validation through Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) testing. We will detail the implementation of Labgrid, an open-source tool used to manage and control remote hardware resources (such as embedded boards and IoT devices). This integration allows the Jenkins pipeline to reserve, provision, and execute automated, system-level tests directly on physical target devices before firmware changes are merged.\nFurthermore, we will introduce two critical elements for pipeline stability and code quality. Firstly, we will demonstrate the utility of an AI-Powered Error Explanation component (e.g., via the Explain Error Plugin). This feature leverages large language models to analyze complex Jenkins log files and pipeline failures, translating cryptic errors into human-readable insights and suggested fixes, which dramatically cuts down debugging time. Secondly, we will showcase the Warnings Next Generation (Warning-NG) Plugin, which serves as a central aggregator, collecting and visualizing issues and potential vulnerabilities reported by various static analysis tools, thereby enforcing strict, quantifiable quality gates within the CI process. Attendees will gain practical, cutting-edge insights into implementing a robust, AI and hardware-enhanced CI/CD workflow suitable for modern open-source projects.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>With everything changing in tech at a frenetic pace, the emphasis on developer productivity has overshadowed the true essence of developer experience (DevEx). While frameworks like SPACE, getDX, and DORA metrics provide valuable insights, they often miss the mark on capturing developers' real, day-to-day experiences using tools and services, instead focusing strictly on the bottom line for the company. Meanwhile, developers and practitioners are job-hopping more than ever. \nThis talk will explore the origins and evolution of \"developer experience,\" dissect popular frameworks, and advocate for a more balanced approach that values the practitioner's perspective. At the end we will set a path towards integrating top-down metrics with bottom-up feedback, ensuring an approach to developer experience that fosters innovation and satisfaction.</p>",

While in Kubernetes Argo Rollouts excels at Progressive Delivery and automated rollbacks to mitigate deployment issues, what if we could go a step further?</p>\n<p>This session explores how to elevate your release process by integrating Agentic AI and asynchronous coding agents, with Argo Rollouts canary deployments. We'll demonstrate how an intelligent agent can automatically analyze a rollout failure, pinpointing the root cause. Beyond diagnosis, these agents can take proactive steps on your behalf, suggesting and even implementing code fixes as new pull requests, which can be redeployed automatically after PR review. This approach moves us closer to truly self-healing deployments.</p>\n<p>Join us to learn how to combine the power of Kubernetes and Argo Rollouts with the autonomous capabilities of Agentic AI, achieving a release experience that is not only seamless but also resilient.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>We love ArgoCD, but it creates a classic \"map vs. territory\" problem. We treat Git as our \"map\", our single source of truth. But the cluster is the \"territory\", and it's often more complex than the map shows.\nThis becomes a crisis with the 3 AM hotfix: an SRE fixes production, changing the territory. ArgoCD, loyal to the map, sees this as drift and helpfully overwrites the fix, re-breaking the cluster.\nThe problem is that Git isn't our Truth, it's our Intention. This talk introduces a pragmatic solution: Cluster-Scoped Snapshotting. We’ll show a simple pattern that dumps the entire live cluster state (the \"territory\") into its own \"reality\" Git repo. To automate this, we wrote a small open-source tool called Kalco, but the pattern is the real takeaway.\nThis \"reality\" repo gives us a powerful \"pre-flight diff\" in our CI pipeline, comparing our \"intention\" (the app repo) against the \"truth\" (the snapshot repo). This simple check lets us bootstrap existing clusters, create a complete audit log, and stop our pipeline before it merges a change that conflicts with a critical live fix.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p><strong>Software backdoors aren’t a myth—they’re a recurring nightmare</strong>. Time and again, we’ve watched malicious code slip into open-source ecosystems. The notorious xz compromise grabbed headlines, but it wasn’t the first act in this drama. Earlier breaches included the PHP incident in 2021, as well as vulnerabilities in vsFTPd (CVE-2011-2523) and ProFTPD (CVE-2010-20103). And here’s the unsettling truth: these examples likely just scratch the surface. <strong>Why does it matter?</strong> Because a single backdoor in a widely used project turns into a hacker’s dream buffet—millions of machines served up for exploitation.</p>\n<p><strong>Tracking down and eliminating backdoors isn’t a quick win</strong>—it’s like diving headfirst into sprawling code jungles. Sounds epic? In reality, even for a veteran armed with reverse-engineering gear, it’s a grueling slog. So grueling that most people simply don’t bother. The good news? <strong>New tools such as ROSA (<a href=\"https://github.com/binsec/rosa\">https://github.com/binsec/rosa</a>) prove that large-scale backdoor detection can be automated</strong>—at least to a significant extent. Here’s the twist: traditional fuzzers like AFL++ (<a href=\"https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus\">https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus</a>) test programs with endless input variations to trigger crashes. It’s brute force, but brilliant for uncovering memory-safety flaws. Backdoors, however, play by different rules—they don’t crash; they lurk behind hidden triggers and perfectly valid behaviors. ROSA changes the game by training fuzzers to tell “normal” execution apart from “backdoored” behavior.</p>\n<p>But there’s a catch: <strong>ROSA’s current use case is after-the-fact analysis, helping security experts vet full software releases</strong> (including binaries). Following the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shift-left_testing\">shift-left paradigm</a>, <strong>our goal is to bring this detection magic into the CI pipeline</strong>—so we can stop backdoors before they ever land. Sounds great, but reality bites: ROSA produces false alarms and can require a significant test budget to find backdoors, which are a nightmare in CI. <strong>In this talk</strong>, we would like explore the methodological and technical upgrades needed to build a ROSA-based backdoor detection prototype that thrives in CI environments. Think reduced resources, and minimal noise—all within the tight resource windows CI jobs demand.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>As security threats become more sophisticated, the need for efficient, real-time communication between identity providers and relying parties is essential. The Shared Signals Framework (SSF) and related specifications such as CAEP and RISC address this challenge by providing a standardised way for systems to exchange security related signals, such as session revocations, credential breaches, and other identity-related incidents, in a secure and scalable manner.\nThis talk introduces the Shared Signals Framework and explains how it enhances security and operational efficiency in modern identity ecosystems. We'll explore how SSF can be supported in Keycloak to enable real-time event-driven communication between providers and relying parties. Attendees will learn how Keycloak can help to detect and mitigate threats, and improve overall system security with SSF.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>SSH is the default access method for Linux servers, typically configured with passwords or public/private key authentication. However, in large multi-user deployments, these methods have significant drawbacks: security of private keys on unmanaged clients, key management on the server side, and the difficulty of integrating multi-factor authentication.</p>\n<p>Alternative methods exist but are not always easy to implement. In this talk, I compare two of the most promising approaches—OpenSSH certificates and OpenPubKey (OPKSSH)—based on a recent evaluation for a multi-user compute cluster with dozens of machines and hundreds of unmanaged clients. I discuss the advantages and limitations of each approach, including client configuration, required additional software, and operational complexity.</p>\n<p>The presentation includes live demos illustrating how each method works from both the client and server perspective, and a closer look at the inner workings of SSH certificates and OPKSSH.</p>\n<p>Links:\nhttps://www.openssh.org\nhttps://github.com/openpubkey/openpubkey\nhttps://github.com/openpubkey/opkssh</p>",

This talk provides a comprehensive introduction to PAM, explaining how it enables system administrators to configure authentication, account management, session setup, and password policies without recompiling applications.</p>\n<p>We begin by exploring the problems PAM was designed to solve—hardcoded authentication logic, inflexibility, and inconsistent security policies across applications. The talk then covers PAM's four management groups: authentication (verifying identity), account management (checking access restrictions), session management (setting up user sessions), and password management (enforcing password policies and token changes).</p>\n<p>Attendees will learn how to read and write PAM configuration files, understand the behavior of different control values (required, requisite, sufficient, optional), and leverage advanced control syntax for complex authentication flows. Special attention is given to the \"frozen stack\" concept—a frequently misunderstood behavior where PAM fixes the module sequence during the first API call.</p>\n<p>Through real-world examples and practical configuration insights, attendees will learn how to troubleshoot PAM issues and understand the impact of PAM configuration changes.</p>\n<p>Beyond understanding current PAM functionality, the talk explores the future of PAM: potential enhancements to address modern authentication needs, architectural improvements and the challenges that stand in the way of evolution. We'll discuss compatibility constraints, the need for backward compatibility with existing deployments, and the tensions between maintaining a stable API and introducing new features.</p>\n<p>This talk is suitable for system administrators, security engineers, and developers who want to understand and effectively configure PAM-based authentication on Linux systems.</p>",

Throughout this process, we identified key integration challenges, their practical resolutions, and the tangible security benefits gained from encrypting internal DNS traffic.</p>\n<p>To validate the feasibility of this approach at scale, we performed extensive workload and performance tests—covering multiple orders of 1,000+ DNS requests per second—comparing encrypted vs. non-encrypted scenarios. These tests demonstrate how to achieve stronger security guarantees without imposing unacceptable latency or throughput penalties.</p>\n<p>As part of this effort, we extended FreeIPA's DNS service with Prometheus-ready metrics, enabling real-time visibility into encrypted DNS performance, request patterns, and system-level statistics. These observability enhancements provide operators with the data required to meet and maintain Zero-Trust mandates.</p>\n<p>By the end of the talk, attendees will understand not only how to deploy encrypted DNS in hybrid Fedora and Kubernetes environments, but also how to measure, validate, and operationalize it in a way that fully aligns with Zero-Trust principles.</p>",

Joe presents his experience as an academic member of the OpenFlexure development team for the last eight years. While his work focuses on the medical applications of the Microscope, research is planned and prioritised to benefit all members of the community. Development of the OpenFlexure software has enabled smart microscopy on the OpenFlexure Microscope, with automated sample identification, smart path planning and image processing, bringing novel research techniques such as digital pathology into new environments which traditionally lack the infrastructure to support them (https://gitlab.com/openflexure/openflexure-microscope-server, https://gitlab.com/openflexure/openflexure-microscope). The research builds on FOSS software and libraries, including Arduino and OpenCV, and extends open science by improving access to essential hardware. This is reflected in the range of OpenFlexure publications from outside the core development team, including peer reviewed articles in the fields of engineering, machine learning, medicine and social science.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>The exponential growth of scientific literature—doubling roughly every nine years—has made it increasingly difficult for researchers and decision-makers to locate, assess, and synthesize the evidence needed for sound policy and practice. Systematic maps and systematic reviews offer robust, unbiased ways to answer “what works?” but today they depend on manual search and screening workflows that are slow, costly, and vulnerable to human error. The result is a bottleneck: high-quality, up-to-date evidence syntheses are often too labor-intensive to produce at the pace conservation challenges demand.</p>\n<p>This talk and demo presents an open, community-driven approach to lowering that bottleneck using human-in-the-loop machine learning and transparent evidence-management tooling. In 2018, DataKind and the the Science for Nature and People Partnership, built two free and open-access, web-based workflows for computer-assisted paper screening and evidence management, integrated into a single collaborative application (colandrapp.com). The platform combines active-learning prioritization, reproducible labeling, and interactive visualization to help teams rapidly identify relevant studies from tens of thousands of documents, extract key metadata, and generate portable, shareable review outputs. All components are designed to support open research practices: auditable decision trails, exportable datasets, and interoperability with downstream synthesis and visualization tools. Now, in 2026, we are releasing a significant update to Colandr that ensures the tool continues to be functional and sustainable.  Colandr is supported by a global community of researchers and volunteers (colandrcommunity.com) and this session will highlight the additional open source solutions that have been built on top of the Colandr stack in addition to the Colandr product updates. </p>\n<p>We aim to engage the FOSDEM community around a concrete open research challenge: building trustworthy, extensible tools that keep evidence synthesis fast, reproducible, and accessible. Participants will leave with a clear view of the platform’s capabilities, the design decisions behind it, and a set of well-scoped technical and research directions where open-source contributors can meaningfully push the state of practice forward.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>AI has become an integral part of modern research, offering tremendous opportunities, but also raising important questions for the Open Science community.</p>\n<p>With the emergence of the Open Source AI Definition (OSAID) and its emphasis on the four freedoms, the “freedom to study” stands out as a cornerstone for achieving true reproducibility. You can read the OSAID definition here: https://opensource.org/ai/open-source-ai-definition.</p>\n<p>This talk will explore how researchers can design, implement, and sustain reproducible AI practices within their work, especially in Low and Middle Income Countries (LMICs), where infrastructure and culture around reproducibility are still developing. Drawing from practical examples and community experiences, I’ll outline actionable steps for embedding openness and reproducibility in AI workflows. These approaches are adaptable across contexts and can help build a more transparent, collaborative, and trustworthy global AI ecosystem.</p>\n<p>My perspective is shaped by my work as an Open Source Manager and Project Coordinator with Data Science Without Borders, and as a contributor to The Turing Way, where I advocate for open, inclusive, and reproducible research practices in data science and AI.</p>",

This talk offers a practical blueprint for scaling inference in vLLM using two complementary techniques, quantization (https://github.com/vllm-project/llm-compressor) and speculative decoding (https://github.com/vllm-project/speculators). Drawing on extensive evaluations across language and vision-language models, we examine the real accuracy–performance trade-offs of each method and, crucially, how they interact in end-to-end deployments. We highlight configurations that substantially cut memory footprint while preserving model quality, and show when these speedups translate best to low-latency versus high-throughput serving. Attendees will leave with data-backed guidance, deployment-ready settings, and a clear roadmap for leveraging quantization and speculative decoding to accelerate vLLM inference in real-world pipelines.</p>",

To bridge this gap, we introduce OQTOPUS (Open Quantum Toolchain for OPerators and USers) [1], a comprehensive open-source software stack designed to build and manage full-scale quantum computing systems.\nOQTOPUS provides a complete cloud architecture for quantum computers, covering three critical layers:\n1.Frontend Layer: Web-based interfaces and SDKs that allow users to easily design and submit quantum circuits.\n2.Cloud Layer: A scalable management system for users, jobs, and devices, designed to be deployable on public clouds (see oqtopus-cloud [2]).\n3.Backend Layer: The core execution engine that handles circuit transcoding, error mitigation, and low-level device control, utilizing modular tools such as OQTOPUS Engine [3] and Tranqu [4].</p>\n<p>Developed in collaboration with The University of Osaka, Fujitsu Limited, Systems Engineering Consultants Co., LTD. (SEC), and TIS Inc. (TIS) is already powering operational superconducting quantum computers. This talk will detail the modular architecture of OQTOPUS, demonstrating how developers and researchers can use it to construct their own quantum cloud platforms, customize compilation strategies, and experiment with hybrid quantum-classical workflows.

    "abstract": "<p>NoiseModelling is an open-source platform for simulating environmental noise propagation and generating regulatory-compliant noise maps at urban and regional scales. Leaded since 2008 by the Joint Research Unit in Environmental Acoustics at Gustave Eiffel University, it provides researchers and practitioners with reproducible, transparent, and scalable modelling capabilities for environmental acoustics. As the modelling core of the Noise-Planet framework, NoiseModelling simulates noise propagation from road traffic, railways, and industrial sources using the standardized CNOSSOS-EU method for emission and propagation. It operates as a Java library or through a user-friendly web interface, tightly integrated with spatial databases H2GIS or PostGIS to handle large-scale urban datasets efficiently. The broader Noise-Planet ecosystem complements NoiseModelling's simulation capabilities with participatory noise measurement through the NoiseCapture mobile application. After more than three years of operation, the platform has collected data from over 100,000 downloads and 74,000 contributors worldwide, enabling citizens and researchers to create high-resolution, crowdsourced noise maps that respect privacy while contributing to scientific research. This integrated approach bridges computational modeling with real-world measurements, promoting open science principles through open-source code, open data, and collaborative research.</p>\n<p>https://noise-planet.org/</p>\n<p>https://noisemodelling.readthedocs.io/en/latest/</p>",

And while the tool was initially created to deal with very large CSV files, it is now also used by people to process small files, and other file formats. The tool was thus included in the daily data manipulation practices of its users, who saw it as an opportunity to never leave their shells, without having to rely on GUIs or notebooks. </p>\n<p>This presentation, given by a research engineer after two years of regular use, examines the reasons for this appropriation, which relates both to the constraints of research in the Humanities and Social Sciences and to the interface design choices that make xan effective.</p>",

Discussing in public, creating inclusive communities, developing governance models suitable for community-driven projects, securing funding are all skills FLOSS developers require to sustain their software projects.</p>\n<p>These skills are equally needed in open research, when it is not merely understood as open access, but it is conceived as an effort to create communities of practice that overcome geographical, disciplinary, and social boundaries. Developing these skills in open research, however, is still work in progress. For instance, peer review, which is a mainstay of research, usually continues to take place behind closed doors and involves a limited number of actors rather than the entire community with risks of fraud and knowledge gatekeeping. Similarly, open research networks struggle to be as inclusive as FLOSS projects. Participation is traditionally determined by institutional affiliations and funding, and citizen science contributions are often neglected because they do not fit into the scheme of traditional scholarly knowledge. Robust governance models and long-term funding strategies are also lacking in open research in many cases.</p>\n<p>The talk is a personal reflection based on my experience working in research data management and engaging in my free time with open-source projects and volunteer-based initiatives to promote coding literacy. At times when AI-generated code is marketed as the only possible future of software, including research software, my reflection focuses instead on the human skills and shared values underpinning software development in FLOSS communities, why I consider them a precious asset, and why I hope they will continue to exist and fully transfer into open research.</p>",

This talk will briefly discuss the movement that created this, then will focus on the experience of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where there is now a group of 45 RSEs in the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), and many more across the university. <a href=\"https://ncsa.illinois.edu/resources-and-services/software-applications/\">RSEs at NCSA</a> bring skills and expertise including full-stack development, UI/UX design, GIS, AI, MLOps, DevOps, and data science and engineering with projects such as <a href=\"https://clowderframework.org/\">Clowder</a>, <a href=\"https://tools.in-core.org/\">IN-CORE</a>, <a href=\"https://chat.illinois.edu/\">Illinois Chat</a>, <a href=\"https://www.earthcube.org/decoder\">DeCODER</a>, etc., across multiple scholarly and industrial domains. Beyond technical advancement, the group has been developing and enhancing mentoring RSEs and RSE managers. The talk will discuss how this group was developed, the challenges it overcame, and the challenges that remain.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>So, you want to create an open-source research software package — and not just for yourself or your group. You’d like people around the world to use it, and even contribute to it. How do you persuade them it’s worth their time?</p>\n<p>Open-source projects rise and fall on trust. You may hope to build trust on technical merits: your algorithm is novel; your implementation fast; your tests thorough. All great, but not enough. Many technically excellent projects never break through because they neglect the social foundations of trust, which are laid long before a project matures.</p>\n<p><strong>And that's good news:</strong> you don’t need to be a top-tier programmer to build a successful open-source tool. Normal researchers do this all the time. What matters most is how you run the project, not how fancy the code is.</p>\n<p>This talk distils lessons from years of building and maintaining scientific Python tools used by researchers worldwide. I’ll outline the practices that signal reliability and sustainability across a project’s lifecycle: defining and communicating your mission from the start; making a reasonable first release and following it up with consistency; and using open communication channels to embody your values and model healthy norms.</p>\n<p>Throughout the talk, I’ll draw on examples from <a href=\"https://movement.neuroinformatics.dev/\">movement</a> — a Python package I develop — and other tools built by the <a href=\"https://neuroinformatics.dev/\">Research Software Engineering team</a> I’m part of. That said, the lessons should be applicable to any free open-source project that aspires to attract and sustain a healthy community.</p>\n<p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> If you behave like a trustworthy project from the beginning, people will treat you like one, and help the project grow into what it promises to be.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>The <a href=\"https://www.gambit-project.org/\">“Gambit”</a> project for computation in game theory has been through multiple phases of development, dating back to the 1980s. Game theory as a field &amp; methodology emerged from economics, but increasingly has applications in cybersecurity, multi-agent systems research and AI. Gambit is used across these fields for both teaching purposes, and as a suite of software tools for scientific computing. Recent Gambit development has been carried out at The Alan Turing Institute and has involved a modernisation of the PyGambit Python API, with a particular focus on improving the user experience, including clear user tutorials and documentation. This in turn has helped to guide the prioritisation of features in recent package releases.</p>\n<p>This talk will introduce some fundamental concepts in game theory using PyGambit, explaining how the package can be used to create and visualise non-cooperative games, and compute their Nash equilibria (where game players have no incentive to deviate their strategies). The talk will also highlight how PyGambit fits into the broader open-source scientific computing ecosystem for research on games via interoperability with the OpenSpiel framework, which is used for reinforcement learning.</p>",

This means <strong>not</strong> doing a rewrite, and instead figuring out how to carefully switch the engine mid-flight from matrix-js-sdk to matrix-rust-sdk running in WASM, ensuring Element Web benefits from all the improvements which have landed in the Element X mobile apps, while simultaneously stopping reinventing the wheel between the two stacks.  We'll demonstrate experiments with <a href=\"https://github.com/element-hq/aurora\">Aurora</a> as our playground for running Element Web's react components on top of matrix-rust-sdk, and explain how we hope to bring decentralised comms to a wider audience by making Element Web as performant and snappy as Element X.</p>\n<p>This talk should be of extreme interest to anyone who has ever complained about Element Web being slow or RAM hungry, and who wants to see a world where decentralised comms can outrun the centralised alternatives!</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Element is the most widely deployed Matrix client, built by the team who created Matrix in order to bootstrap the ecosystem.  The last few years have been quite a rollercoaster in terms of figuring out how to ensure Element can contribute to Matrix sustainably long-term - a problem faced by many open source projects whose core team works on the project as their day job.</p>\n<p>The good news is we think we've now found a sustainable model that works, having moved from Apache to AGPL and having finally released an official Matrix distribution from Element in the form of <a href=\"https://github.com/element-hq/ess-helm\">Element Server Suite (ESS) Community</a> under the AGPL.  In this talk we'll give a super quick tour of the journey that we've been on and the learnings encountered along the way, in the hope that other decentralised comms projects can learn from our mistakes and successes.  We'll look at the work Element's been doing to sustainably progress Matrix - be that driving forwards Matrix 2.0 spec work, maintaining Synapse, or ensuring that matrix-rust-sdk provides a foundational client SDK suitable for Element X, Fractal, iamb and more.</p>\n<p>Finally, we'll take a quick look at how Element has ended up bringing decentralised communication to the heart of public sector open source collaboration suites such as Germany's <a href=\"https://www.opendesk.eu/en\">openDesk</a> from ZenDiS, France's <a href=\"https://lasuite.numerique.gouv.fr/en\">La Suite</a> from DINUM, and The Netherlands' <a href=\"https://github.com/MinBZK/mijn-bureau-infra\">MijnBureau</a> from MinBZK - and take a look at what the future may bring!</p>",

Using infrastructure and standardized protocols that are usually de facto controlled by large, commercial platforms, they provide a way of structuring and querying data about individual nodes (often users) in a network and the relationships (edges) between these nodes. They are theoretically extensible, and social graph data can typically also be represented using open standards like RDF which can be published and consumed by other authorities participating in a network. However, trying to enable participation or federation this way is frequently wishful thinking, and does not really facilitate scaling that social graph beyond a particular API representation of rows in one organization’s database.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://atproto.com/\">Atmosphere</a> — built on AT — presents a different approach. When you write data using Atmosphere APIs, such as by <a href=\"https://docs.bsky.app/docs/tutorials/creating-a-post\">posting to Bluesky</a>, that data is associated with your personal <a href=\"https://atproto.com/guides/data-repos\">data repository</a>.

Each Atmosphere app declares its own schema (<a href=\"https://atproto.com/guides/lexicon\">Lexicon</a>), and reads and writes its own set of fields. These fields can be read by <a href=\"https://anisota.net/feed\">any other app built on the Atmosphere</a>, allowing users to both a) own and b) span their graphs across the network.</p>\n<p>This enables several in-demand use cases. Building <a href=\"https://docs.bsky.app/docs/advanced-guides/federation-architecture\">“big world”</a> social apps with AT is only a matter of creating new lexicons to support additional data models, designing app views which serve this data (along with any other data that may already be available to a user’s graph from other AT apps), and <a href=\"https://atproto.com/guides/self-hosting\">self-hosting</a> the necessary infrastructure.</p>\n<p>We provide <a href=\"https://github.com/bluesky-social/cookbook/\">implementation patterns</a>, along with primitives and tools that are of interest to almost all implementers — like OAuth Scopes and moderation tools. We also provide a social networking app (<a href=\"http://bsky.social/\">Bluesky Social</a>) that serves as both a reference implementation for the protocol, and a critical-mass opportunity to populate users’ social graphs so that other application developers can benefit from shared data. Regardless of which application is using this data, all of it is open, public, and associated with individual users’ data repositories, which can be migrated across the network at will.</p>\n<p>This talk will provide a demonstration of some fundamental AT technologies, including:\n\"Sipping the Firehose\" - working with the stream, a demo of creating records and have them pop right out\n“Getting backlinks with Constellation” - querying social interactions in real time, and building that data into different interfaces\n“Lexicon Authoring” - a discussion of best practices for creating additional schemas, with examples from other apps in the Atmosphere</p>",

I covered several decentralized tools and protocols, and then I asked, \"Are there any questions?\"  One person asked, \"How do I convince my friends to move to those tools\"? And the audience nodded in agreement. </p>\n<p>Then I took this topic seriously. With this talk, I aim to cover the subject of their adoption - we all build great tools, but what approaches can we use to encourage people to join the right side?

    "abstract": "<p>When a kernel component like a storage driver misbehaves in production, developers face a difficult choice. They either have too little information to solve the bug or they enable slow console-level debug logs that ruin performance. This talk introduces a per-component binary logging mechanism designed to support verbose logging in production with negligible run-time cost.</p>\n<p>We achieve this efficiency by moving the heavy lifting to build time. using preprocessor macros, we emit parameter serialization stubs and save location-specific formats in a separate side table. At run time, the hot path only records a location ID, a timestamp, and the raw parameters. No format expansion occurs until the logs are read. We support high concurrency using a mostly lock-free multi-level allocator that allows dozens of CPUs to write simultaneously.</p>\n<p>We also introduce a significant architectural change by adding a single TLS pointer to <code>struct task_struct</code>. This tags each thread with a private logging buffer. If a thread stalls or deadlocks, the tag remains attached to the buffer. This allows post-mortem analysis to reveal the exact context-specific history of that thread.</p>\n<p>Unlike <code>ftrace_printk</code> which dumps everything into a single global ring, our logger maintains one ring per component context. This allows you to capture exactly the data you need for a specific file system or operation. The memory footprint is minimal. Each record is only eight bytes. This saves 16 bytes per entry compared to the standard <code>bprint_entry</code>. This efficiency reduces memory accesses and facilitates a truly production-ready binary logging infrastructure.</p>\n<p>We can finally keep verbose logging active at all times. This ensures that when a crash or deadlock occurs, the high-fidelity history needed to solve it is already waiting in memory.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Tracing complex systems often requires insights from both the kernel and userspace. While tools like Linux's ftrace excel at kernel-level observability and LTTng provides low-overhead userspace tracing, unifying these disparate data sources for a holistic view remains a challenge: using LTTng for kernel tracing requires an out-of-tree kernel module, which can be a barrier for many users.</p>\n<p>This talk introduces bt2-ftrace-to-ctf - a new open-source project designed to bridge this gap. Our solution processes a trace.dat file from ftrace (kernel part) and a LTTng UST for userspace, then aligns and rewrites the trace in the Common Trace Format (CTF), as used by LTTng. The resulting output is directly consumable by tools like Trace Compass, enabling comprehensive, synchronized analysis of system behavior across all layers without the need for custom kernel modules.</p>\n<p>The project consists of two key components:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A Babeltrace2 plugin: This plugin allows babeltrace2 to directly read trace-cmd's trace.dat files, providing a standardized interface for ftrace data. It includes source and sink components for flexible data handling and metadata emission.</li>\n<li>A trace.dat to CTF converter: This utility utilizes the Babeltrace2 plugin to transform ftrace data into an LTTng-alike kernel trace in CTF format. Crucially, it can also combine this kernel trace with an existing LTTng userspace trace, producing a single, unified trace directory.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the talk, we will give an overview on the tool and discuss challenges during its implementation.</p>\n<p>Project: https://github.com/siemens/bt2-ftrace-to-ctf (MIT, LGPL-2.1-or-later)</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>TPMs have been present in modern laptops and servers for some time now, but their adoption is quite low. While operating systems do provide some security features based on TPMs (think of BitLocker on Windows or dm-verity on Linux) third party applications or libraries usually do not have TPM integrations.</p>\n<p>One of the main reasons of low TPM adoption is that interfacing with TPMs is quite hard: there are competing TPM software stacks (Intel vs IBM), lack of key format standardization (currently being worked on) and many operating systems are not set up from the start to make TPM easily available (TPM device file is owned by root or requires privileged group for access). Even with a proper software stack the application may have to deal with low-level TPM communication protocols, which are hard to get right.</p>\n<p>In this presentation we will explore a better integration of TPMs with some Linux Kernel subsystems, in particular: kernel keystore and cryptographic API. We will see how it allows the Linux Kernel to expose hardware-based security to third party applications in an easy to use manner by encapsulating the TPM communication complexities as well as providing higher-level use-case based security primitives.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>The basic concept of Secure Boot is now well established (and widely used in Linux for nearly 15) years.  Most people now decline to take ownership of their systems (by replacing the CA keys in the UEFI db variable) and instead pivot trust away from the UEFI variables to the MoK (Machine Owner Key) ones instead, which can be updated from the operating system.  Thus if you want to secure boot your own kernel, you usually create a signing key and load that into MoK.</p>\n<p>This talk will go quickly over the history, how you take ownership, what problems you encounter, how you create and install your own signing keys in MoK and how the kernel imports all these keys into the keyring system and uses them (verifying module signatures and IMA signed policy) including the differences betwen the machine and secondary_trusted keyrings.  We'll also discuss some of the more recent innovations, like adding SBAT to the rather problematic UEFI revocation story and how it works.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Usermode Linux (UML) has been developed and maintained in linus tree for decades and well used by kernel developers as an instant way of virtualization within a userspace process, without relying on hypervisor (i.e., qemu/kvm) or software partition (i.e., namespace).  Recently unit testing framework for kernel tree, KUnit, bases UML as a underlying infrastructure for the framework, which brings us more opportunities to use UML.  However, UML is known as low syscall performance, mainly derived from the overhead of context switches caused with ptrace(2) syscall hook implementation.  Additionally its dependency to the underlying environment (e.g., processor architecture, operating systems) makes it hard to refactor its implementation.</p>\n<p>This talk introduces yet-another extension to UML, based on the architecture without MMU emulation.  The kernel is configured with the option <code>CONFIG_MMU=n</code>, and we can apply alternate syscall hook mechanisms such as seccomp and zpoline in order to eliminate the bottlenecks of ptrace-based one.  As a bonus, we can exercise nommu subsystem with a plenty of testing framework implemented with KUnit.</p>\n<p>I will briefly overview its implementation, the comparison with the original UML architecture, and share several measurement results obtained during the development.  We will also share the upstreaming status which we have been proposed [*1].</p>\n<p>*1: https://lore.kernel.org/all/cover.1762075876.git.thehajime@gmail.com/</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>This talk follows last year's presentation \"Status and Desiderata for Syscall Tracing and Virtualization Support\" and reports on progress and remaining gaps in Linux system call tracing.</p>\n<p>The talk presents a set of Linux kernel patches, intended for upstream submission, that address the following limitations and aim to make system call tracing and virtualization more expressive, portable, and efficient.</p>\n<p>Over the past year, support for PTRACE_SET_SYSCALL_INFO has been merged into the mainline kernel. While developing a portable version of VUOS across multiple architectures, several limitations of the current tracing interfaces became evident. In particular, skipping a system call by setting its number to -1 is insufficient, as it does not allow the tracer to control the return value or errno, nor to adjust the program counter. As a consequence, the current VUOS proof-of-concept replaces skipped system calls with getpid and fixes up the return value at PTRACE_SYSCALL_INFO_EXIT, doubling the number of context switches and incurring a measurable performance cost. Updating the program counter currently requires non-portable, architecture-specific code using PTRACE_POKEUSER or PTRACE_SETREGSET.</p>\n<p>Additional issues arise with seccomp_unotify. Tracing all system calls is difficult because file descriptors must be transferred from the traced task to the tracer; common techniques based on UNIX domain sockets and ancillary messages require sendmsg and recvmsg themselves to be excluded from tracing.  Furthermore, there is currently no support for virtualizing the F_DUPFD command of fcntl, nor for allowing a tracer to atomically close a file descriptor in the traced process.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Upstreaming kernel support traditionally happens only after silicon becomes available, but this approach often delays software enablement and ecosystem readiness. For the first time in the RISC-V world, we are tackling the challenge of pre-silicon kernel upstreaming—enabling Linux kernel features ahead of actual chip availability.\nIn this session, we will share the methodology, toolchains, and collaborative workflows that make this possible, including the use of simulation platforms, pre-silicon verification environments, and CI/CD integration for early kernel testing. Attendees will learn how these efforts accelerate software-hardware co-design, reduce bring-up cycles, and ensure that by the time silicon arrives, the kernel is already upstream-ready.\nThis pioneering approach not only shortens time-to-market but also sets a new model for open source hardware-software collaboration in the RISC-V ecosystem.\nKey Takeaways:\n- Why pre-silicon kernel upstreaming is a game-changer for RISC-V.\n- The tools and processes used to validate and upstream before silicon.\n- Lessons learned and best practices for collaborating with the open source community.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Currently, the only way to attach a piece of information to an network packet (sk_buff) that will travel with it through the Linux network stack is the 32-bit mark field.</p>\n<p>Once set, the mark can be read in firewall rules, used to drive routing, and accessed by BPF programs, among other uses. This versatility leads to fierce competition over the mark’s bits. Being just 32 bits wide, it often ends up limiting its practical applications.</p>\n<p>That is why in 2024 we embarked on a journey to enable users to attach hundreds of bytes of metadata to network packets - a concept which we call \"rich packet metadata\" - which unblocks new and exciting applications such as:\n* Tracing packets through layers of the network stack, even when crossing the kernel-user space barrier.\n* Metadata-based packet redirection, routing, and socket steering with early packet classification in XDP.\n* Extraction of information from encapsulation headers and passing it to user space, or vice versa.</p>\n<p>While we have made significant progress since the project has started. Our journey ([1], [2]) to let BPF programs and user-space apps attach rich metadata to packets is far from over. In this talk, we'll share what's been done, what's next, what we've learned, and where are the dragons we've yet to slay.</p>\n<h1>Part I: Upstream Progress and Roadmap</h1>\n<p>We'll cover:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Why we shifted from the old \"skb traits\" idea [3] to reusing existing <code>skb</code> metadata.</li>\n<li>How <code>bpf_dynptr</code> came to the rescue, and why <code>skb-&gt;data_meta</code> still haunts us.</li>\n<li>The blockers that keep metadata from traveling cleanly through the Rx path and how we plan to fix them.</li>\n<li>Our roadmap for making metadata work on the Tx path.</li>\n<li>Ideas for producing and consuming metadata directly in the network stack.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Part II: Lessons from Production</h1>\n<p>Since our last update [2], we've built several features with packet metadata in Cloudflare's production environment. We'll share hard-earned lessons, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Managing metadata contents and optimizing metadata area size.</li>\n<li>Using a TLV structure to encode metadata, and how we shuffle it between packet data, metadata area, and maps.</li>\n<li>Real-world challenges of reading and writing metadata efficiently.</li>\n<li>Passing metadata from packet to socket layers, with full access for TCP via socket options—and our creative hacks for UDP.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Finally, we'll discuss where things still hurt:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Testing headaches and why <code>BPF_PROG_RUN</code> needs love.</li>\n<li>What an ideal user API would look like for us.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you're curious about where packet metadata is headed, or want to help shape the future, this session is for you.</p>\n<p>[1] https://lpc.events/event/18/contributions/1935/\n[2] https://www.netdevconf.info/0x19/sessions/talk/traits-rich-packet-metadata.html\n[3] https://lore.kernel.org/all/20250422-afabre-traits-010-rfc2-v2-0-92bcc6b146c9@arthurfabre.com/</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Cluster orchestrators such as Kubernetes rely on an accurate model of the resources available on each worker node in a cluster and on the resources a given job requires, using this information to place the job onto a suitable worker node in the cluster. If either is inaccurate, the orchestrator will make poor job placement decisions, resulting in poor performance.</p>\n<p>I observe that Linux kernel scheduling overheads can, for workloads making heavy use of Linux's group scheduling (cgroups) which include common serverless workloads, become so significant as to make the orchestrator model of worker node resources inaccurate. In practice this effect is mitigated by over-provisioning the cluster.</p>\n<p>I propose and evaluate an enhancement to the Linux Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) that mitigates these effects. By prioritising task completion over strict fairness, the enhanced scheduler is able to drain contended CPU run queues more rapidly and reduce time lost to context switching. Experimental results show that this approach can deliver equivalent performance using up at least 10% fewer worker nodes, significantly improving cluster efficiency.</p>",

    "abstract": "<h2>Abstract</h2>\n<p>Europe has bold ambitions for open source and digital sovereignty, yet most initiatives struggle to deliver meaningful change where it matters: at the level of local institutions. Despite strong strategies and political commitments, implementation stalls because the policy frameworks guiding European digital transformation ignore a simple truth. Europe is built on a multi-level governance system where local actors carry the responsibility for execution but lack the incentives, support, and capacity to act.</p>\n<p>Drawing on hands-on experience from Denmark’s OS2 (<a href=\"https://os2.eu\">os2.eu</a>) community, where more than 85% of municipalities jointly develop and maintain open source solutions, this talk examines why current EU-level open source policy risks failing in practice. It unpacks three systemic barriers:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Weak incentives at local level:</strong> Municipalities lack resources, competencies, and organisational maturity to prioritise open source adoption. Financial savings are not an effective incentive, because open source is not a budget trick; it requires long-term investment in capacity.</li>\n<li><strong>Multi-level governance creates structural friction:</strong> Authority is distributed across EU, national, and local levels. While this strengthens democracy, it fragments responsibility. National governments centralise; local authorities implement without adequate support; and EU ambitions rarely translate into actionable change.</li>\n<li><strong>Vendor dominance distorts procurement and advice:</strong> Large IT vendors shape decision-making, reinforce proprietary dependency, and overshadow sovereign alternatives. The barriers are governance- and leadership-related, not technical.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The talk ends with practical policy recommendations: risk-bearing EU capital for local transitions, stronger alignment between EU-level commitments and local implementation realities, and a cultural shift where every new digital project must explicitly break with “doing things the way we always have”.</p>\n<h2>Speaker bio</h2>\n<p>Rasmus Frey is Chief Executive and Secretary at OS2 (<a href=\"https://os2.eu\">os2.eu</a>), Denmark’s open-source community for public digital collaboration.</p>\n<p>He works at the intersection of governance, innovation, and technology, helping municipalities and public institutions co-develop and reuse digital solutions through open collaboration and shared ownership.</p>\n<p>Rasmus contributes to European networks on open-source governance and digital sovereignty, with a focus on institutional design and democratic digital infrastructure.</p>",

Lastly, we present examples of <a href=\"https://howtheyvote.eu\">HowTheyVote.eu</a> data being used in journalism, research, and civil society, showcasing how accessible voting records can inform debates and thus ultimately strengthen European democracy.</p>\n<p>The European Parliament is the only directly democratically elected EU institution, and, as such, the voting behavior of its members is of particular interest. With a significantly larger number of right-wing MEPs since last year's elections, keeping an eye on the developments in Parliament has become more important than ever. Although the Parliament publishes information such as roll-call vote results and plenary minutes on its website, it can be difficult to find out what exactly MEPs voted on or how a particular vote turned out, as the data is scattered across multiple sources, published in different formats, and made available at different times.</p>\n<p>We started <a href=\"https://howtheyvote.eu\">HowTheyVote.eu</a> in 2021 as a free and open-source project to address these problems. On <a href=\"https://howtheyvote.eu\">HowTheyVote.eu</a>, users can search for votes and view results.

He will discuss why these practices work, the benefits they bring, how they could be adopted by the European Standardisation Organisations, and which transition mechanisms could help bridge the gap until the ESOs are able to catch up.</p>",

This represented the culmination of 7 years of hard work done by members of the GIMP community. Many major and long-awaited features were introduced including non-destructive editing, multi-layer operations, infinite canvas, more advanced colour management and much more.</p>\n<p>The GIMP team had made a decision that starting with the 3.0 release the length of development cycles would be reduced. This has been followed, and has lead to the next big release - the 3.2.</p>\n<p>Today a core developer who joined the team within the past year presents the latest release of GIMP, takes a look at what's being worked on by the members of the GIMP community, and shares the experience of becoming a GIMP developer. You can look forward to hearing something about all the file formats GIMP aims to support, full CMYK mode, improved text support, hardware-accelerated image operations and more!</p>",

This is a work-in-progress demo and call for feedback from the FOSS audio community.</p>\n<p><strong>Why podcasters need their own tool:</strong></p>\n<p>Most podcasters currently rely on DAWs like Audacity, Ardour, or Reaper—tools designed for musicians with workflows that don't match podcast production. Podcasters need noise reduction, mouth click removal, transcript editing synchronized with audio, chapter markers, metadata management (ID3, RSS, Podcasting 2.0 tags), and one-click publishing—not MIDI sequencing or complex mixing boards.</p>\n<p><strong>What we'll show you:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Live WIP demo</strong> of Podlibre's plugin-based architecture</li>\n<li><strong>Automated transcription</strong> running locally on your laptop—no cloud services required</li>\n<li><strong>Transcript correction UI</strong> optimized for keyboard-only editing (inspired by Aegisub but podcast-focused)</li>\n<li><strong>Workflow customization</strong>: how our plugin system lets you build your own production pipeline</li>\n<li><strong>Publishing integrations</strong>: direct export to Castopod, Funkwhale, Faircamp, and local storage</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>What we need from you:</strong></p>\n<p>Podlibre is funded by Ad Aures (creators of Castopod) and NLnet, currently in active development. We're here to gather feedback from the FOSS audio community: What features matter? What libraries should we integrate? How can we build bridges with existing audio tools (PipeWire, LV2, VST)?</p>\n<p>Join us to shape a podcast editor that serves the 350,000+ active podcasters who deserve open-source tools built for their craft.</p>",

This talk will explore the possibilities and hand some guidelines to squeeze out as much headroom your system has for all those resource hungry plugins. Along the way some myths might get debunked and some helpful tools will get introduced.</p>\n<p>During the talk I will walk through how to set up your system so it can do low-latency real-time audio. With low-latency I mean round-trip latencies below 10 ms. I will show which tools can help with getting your system to perform better for doing music production. Such tools include <a href=\"https://codeberg.org/rtcqs/rtcqs\" title=\"rtcqs\">rtcqs</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/gaheldev/Millisecond\" title=\"Millisecond\">Millisecond</a> for finding and fixing possible bottlenecks, jack_iodelay or <a href=\"https://ardour.org\" title=\"Ardour\">Ardour</a> for measuring round-trip latencies and <a href=\"https://github.com/Gimmeapill/xruncounter\" title=\"xruncounter\">xruncounter</a> to do DSP load stress tests.</p>\n<p>I will also look backward briefly to 15 years ago when I did a similar talk at the <a href=\"http://lac.linuxaudio.org/2011/recordings/day1_1400_Configuring_your_system_for_low-latency_real-time_audio_processing.ogv\" title=\"Video of my talk about system configuration during LAC2011 in Maynooth\">Linux Audio Conference in Maynooth</a>, what has changed since then, what has improved? I will also glare a bit at the future as the Linux Audio Conference will be held in Maynooth again this year and chances are I will dive deeper into this matter during that conference.</p>\n<p>After the talk you will hopefully have a better grasp of what the key factors are for getting a better performing machine that has as little of those dreaded xruns as possible!</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>MBROLA and eSpeak NG are two speech synthesizers that can be used as MIDI instruments. MBROLA has been often uses for singing synthesis, because it allows you to control timing and pitch via its text interface. It became free software in 2018. Before 2018 I was already listening to a lot of VOCALOID and UTAU music, and I began researching how to implement my own singing speech synthesizer by reading \"An introduction to text-to-speech synthesis\" by Thierry Dutoit (author of MBROLA) and many other papers related to VOCALOID and UTAU. With a deep understanding how the MBROLA algorithm works I began to implement my own independant singing voice synthesizer, with eSpeak as an optional frontend.</p>",

At the time, I mostly talked about the typical workflow for creating and recording music with either real or virtual instruments, but with a focus more on rock/pop music, in order to keep things simpler.</p>\n<p>In this presentation I'll address a different point of view, that is how you can have a full symphonic orchestra in your laptop, write music for it and then have it performed in ways that are hopefully realistic enough to be used within the context of your compositions (unless you know 80 people that can play your music for you, that is!). I'll present my typical workflow, and the different pieces of software I used to make it possible for me to write purely classical music (symphonic poems), but also orchestral arrangements for songs in different genres (e.g., folk, progressive rock or metal) that I published as a hobby in my free time over the years.</p>\n<p>Again, a clickbait title because I'm not really an orchestra composer... but FOSS definitely helped make me feel like one, and it can help you too!</p>",

Like with live coding, in PAW you write code to describe a piece of music incrementally. As part of this, you also build a GUI for direct manipulation of that same code, providing similar affordances to traditional DAWs.</p>\n<p>PAW stems from my observations that regular DAWs tend to be limited in what they let users do, due to fundamental limitations with traditional GUIs. I believe that mixing in ideas from live coding, and programming at large, can help savvy users shed those limitations, while retaining familiar GUI affordances and usability.</p>\n<p>The software is open source, but not yet quite usable. My goal with this talk is to share ideas with other people in the field of music production software.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Music ensembles are moving from sheet music to tablets with PDFs. Many apps exists but all are focuses on individual musicians, not on bands. Rehorse is a web app with offline support that can be self-hosted by a band. The band librarian makes the music available to the band members. They can annotate the sheet music, practice with recordings with convenient section repeats.\nThe app lists rehearsal and concert playlists and has (optional) access management to prevent members from downloading all parts, but e.g. only those from their section.</p>\n<p>Recordings and sheet music are stored offline so the sheet music is available even at performances where no network is available.</p>\n<p>Rehorse has been under development and in use in several bands for years. This talk invites new users and potential contributors. It goes into the workflows that musicians expect and the high standards that they are used to from other apps.</p>\n<p>https://codeberg.org/vandenoever/rehorse</p>",

Our entire stack is Rust-based—from Embassy firmware and the embedded HAL to the Wasm toolchain and the runtimes themselves. We will outline the requirements that running Wasm in <code>no_std</code> environments imposes on runtimes, particularly in the context of distributed systems with constrained devices. We will then share our experience with Rust-native runtimes such as wasmtime, wasmi, and tinywasm and with embedding WAMR into Rust firmware, focusing on how each runtime aligned with these requirements and the modifications or integration work needed to support our use case. We will also discuss how we structure and compile our Wasm modules, and the trade-offs we make between developer ergonomics, code portability, and the memory footprint of the resulting binaries. The goal of this talk is to provide practical lessons for Rust developers, highlight gaps in today’s embedded-Wasm tooling, and point out opportunities for new open-source contributions.</p>\n<p>Links to relevant projets:\n- wasmtime (https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime)\n- wamr (https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-micro-runtime)\n- wasmi (https://github.com/wasmi-labs/wasmi)\n- tinywasm (https://github.com/explodingcamera/tinywasm)\n- A link to Myrmic is not yet available since it will be open-sourced early 2026</p>",

We’ll dive into the implementation details - including how Godot-specific futures are constructed, polled, and scheduled - and discuss the challenges we faced when implementing <code>async</code> while interacting with the engine's C++ code over FFI on potentially multiple threads. </p>\n<p>This talk will be especially valuable for developers interested in embedding async logic godot and other game engines or understanding how async can be made “engine-native” rather than externally bolted on.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Modern networking software often forces developers to choose between rigid, off-the-shelf frameworks and the painstaking effort of building everything from scratch. Rama takes a different path. It’s a modular Rust framework that lets you move and transform packets across the network stack, without giving up control, safety, or composability.</p>\n<p>In this talk, I’ll explore together with the audience how Rama’s philosophy of layers, services, and extensions turns network programming into a flexible and enjoyable experience. You’ll see how its building blocks span multiple layers of abstraction. From transport and TLS up to HTTP, and a lot more in between. All while you can still easily plug in your own logic or replace existing components. It also shows how you can build network stacks that aren't possible anywhere else, and all without a sweat. For example socks5 over TLS. Why not.</p>\n<p>Through practical examples, we’ll look at how Rama empowers developers to build everything from proxies and servers to custom network tools, while still benefiting from Rust’s performance and safety guarantees. Whether you’re curious about programmable networking, Rust’s async ecosystem, or just want to build things your own way, this talk will show you how Rama helps you do it, all with elegance and confidence.</p>\n<p>More information about rama itself can be found at https://ramaproxy.org/, which is developed and maintained by https://plabayo.tech/, a FOSS, consulting and commercial technology (small family) company from Ghent.</p>\n<p>https://github.com/plabayo/rama</p>",

This testing approach shakes out many difficult to find bugs before they reach production and greatly increases developer confidence in system correctness when making new changes.</p>\n<p>DST was first popularized by the FoundationDB team, and is slowly finding its way into the testing arsenal of many products like TigerBeetle, Resonate, and more recently, Turso’s rewrite of SQLLite in Rust. This talk will cover how we implemented DST of our distributed storage system at Polar Signals by modelling our core components as state machines and why this was the right choice for us over other approaches that use deterministic async runtimes (e.g. https://github.com/madsim-rs/madsim).</p>\n<p>Come learn more about DST and how it can help you write better and more resilient software!</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>In this talk, we will introduce PUMA (Programmable Utility for Mobile Automation), an open-source Python tool developed by the Netherlands Forensic Institute. PUMA streamlines mobile app automation by allowing users to define high-level actions—like sending messages or searching in apps—without manual UI scripting. PUMA is designed for ease-of-use and reproducibility, making it ideal for testing, research, and workflow automation.\nWe’ll explore PUMA’s architecture, key features, and practical applications, from forensic purposes like generating reference datasets, educational purposes like how to validate your application, to personal use cases like automating repetitive tasks. Whether you’re a developer, tester, or automation enthusiast, discover how PUMA can save time, reduce errors, and unlock new possibilities in mobile automation.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Software reverse engineering is a very useful tool in digital forensics. Not only can it tells us a lot about the inner workings of the software of interest, it can also lead us to quirks and even vulnerabilities not even available in the source (e.g. compiler quirks). With enough effort it even turns proprietary implementations into open-source, what's not to like?</p>\n<p>Of course, with a technique this powerful, there will always be downsides. Reverse engineering large binaries can be a monumental task. Where a few kB's of storage seem tiny, a few kB's of code can be huge if you have to reverse it all. A secondary problem to this, is that all this work is quite hard to reuse in the future. Binary code can differ, even with the same source, purely based on compiler options. SRE tools change, making your scripts obsolete. Decompilers change, making your signatures obsolete and so on. </p>\n<p>We present an open-source machine learning model, server and Ghidra plugin for creating function signatures from aarch64 assembly. These function signatures can be stored and compared to a database of known functions to easily reuse all the blood, sweat and tears you put into reversing that library that has since been updated twice.</p>\n<p>All code is of course open source and available at https://github.com/NetherlandsForensicInstitute/asmtransformers</p>",

With far fewer dedicated designers in FOSS than in the commercial tech world, usability issues go unaddressed, and end users feel the friction. The good news: you don’t need a design degree or a new job title to make a difference. In this talk, I’ll show how any contributor can use simple, practical design methods to identify and solve UX issues in their favorite open source projects. I’ll try to break down “design” into simple steps anyone can try, noticing where people get stuck, asking the right questions, sketching ideas on paper, and trying them out with friends or community members. No special skills or software needed: just curiosity and a willingness to make things easier for others. If you’ve ever thought, “I see the problem, but I’m not a designer” - this talk will give you the mindset and tools to step up and become one.</p>",

Visualization of short-term and long-term eye tracking data series is explained with sample code for Graphviz and GNU Octave. Examples of eye tracking heatmaps and their usage scenarios are discussed, as well as using mouse heatmaps as supplementary data.</p>",

For example, static typing and compilation to native code make it intrinsically type safe and blazingly fast. Yet built-in type inference makes most type annotations unnecessary, resulting in easy to read and clean code. It feels like a dynamic language.\nCrystal’s runtime allows the programmer to write I/O operations as if they were blocking, but they're actually non-blocking under the hood.</p>",

Lua’s minimal standard library makes this even harder—how can we provide a portable, lightweight solution? In this talk we’ll explore terminal.lua (built on top of luasystem): a minimal, cross-platform terminal UI library for Lua designed to provide essential terminal primitives without external dependencies like curses. The work presented here includes developments made during its participation in GSoC 2025, as well as improvements made afterwards.</p>\n<p>Lua intentionally keeps its standard library small, so handling terminals requires defining the true minimum set of capabilities needed for Unix, macOS, and Windows — while keeping the API simple, consistent, and predictable. The talk begins by outlining the problem: how to handle terminals portably and transparently in a lightweight language by creating a level playing field. We’ll then walk through the minimal core implemented in luasystem and how terminal.lua builds a higher-level layer on top.</p>\n<p>We’ll discuss:\nLow-level:\n- Bridging differences between Unix/POSIX and Windows\n- UTF-8/Unicode handling (including double-width characters such as emojis)\n- Non-blocking async keyboard input in single-threaded Lua\n- Querying the terminal (e.g., retrieving cursor position)</p>\n<p>Higher-level:\n- Representing terminal state (color, cursor position/shape/visibility)\n- Basic layouting and color handling</p>\n<p>Projects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>LuaSystem — a C library exposing the absolute bare minimum terminal and system primitives needed to let Lua build a UI layer on top: https://github.com/lunarmodules/luasystem</li>\n<li>terminal.lua — the “proof of the pudding”: a pure-Lua UI library that demonstrates what can be built cleanly and portably when sticking to those minimal primitives: https://github.com/lunarmodules/terminal.lua</li>\n</ul>",

    "abstract": "<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)\">Lisp</a> is often decried for being hard to read and having too little syntax. This talk argues that the parentheses are not the point, but the uniform structure is! Lisp is like clay: a medium which is versatile for building many shapes and sculpting beautiful new technical visions. Christine Lemmer-Webber makes an argument that lisp's power comes from composable DSLs, and that this power is what gives projects like <a href=\"https://guix.gnu.org/\">Guix</a> and <a href=\"https://spritely.institute/\">Spritely</a> much of their strength.</p>",

    "slug": "9NQYKC-funcpropagators",
    "url": "https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/9NQYKC-funcpropagators/",
    "abstract": "<p>Functional reactive programming (FRP) is a declarative programming paradigm that is most commonly used in interactive applications where imperative, event-driven, callback-laden code quickly becomes overwhelming and difficult to reason about. The reduction in cognitive overhead comes at a price, however. Popular reactive systems are limited to one-way data flow (a directed acyclic graph) which limits the types of problems these systems can solve elegantly. Fortunately, a way to remove this limitation has been known for over 15 years! Alexey Radul's 2009 PhD thesis \"Propagation Networks: A Flexible and Expressive Substrate for Computation\" tells us how. In this talk, I'll use Guile Scheme to demonstrate how an FRP system built on the propagator model allows for cyclic dependencies without user-visible glitches whilst keeping implementation complexity low.</p>",

The images are tested for regression, and automatically uploaded to the GitLab container registry and to Docker Hub.  We will also talk about what these images can be used for, with examples of long-term reproducible tarball artifacts for official releases of GNU Libtasn1, InetUtils, Libidn2 and SASL. We will also go into limitations involving security trade-offs for reducing guix-daemon privileges, and the interaction between GitLab shared runners, user namespaces and other security complications.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Learned sparse retrieval models such as SPLADE, uniCOIL, and other transformer-based sparse encoders have become popular for delivering neural-level relevance while preserving the efficiency of inverted indexes. But these models also produce indexes with statistical properties radically different from classic BM25: longer queries, compressed vocabularies, and posting lists with unusual score distributions. As a result, traditional dynamic pruning algorithms like WAND and Block-Max WAND often fail to exploit their full potential.</p>\n<p>This talk presents Block-Max Pruning (BMP) from a systems and Rust-engineering perspective. We will walk through how BMP restructures query processing by partitioning document space into small, contiguous blocks and maintaining lightweight, on-the-fly score upper bounds that guide safe or approximate early termination.</p>\n<p>The talk is aimed at developers building retrieval engines, Rust-based data systems, or ML-powered search pipelines who want to push sparse retrieval performance further.\nAttendees will leave with a clear understanding of how BMP works, why learned sparse models require new pruning strategies, and how to integrate these ideas into modern, high-performance Rust codebases.</p>\n<p>Code and resources:\nBMP GitHub repository: https://github.com/pisa-engine/BMP/\nPaper (SIGIR 2024): https://www.antoniomallia.it/uploads/SIGIR24.pdf</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Profile-Guided Optimization (PGO) is a well-known compiler optimization technique that brings runtime statistics about how an application is executed to the Ahead-of-Time (AoT) compilation model, which is quite recently added to the Go compiler. However, this technique is not widely used nowadays.</p>\n<p>In this talk, I want to discuss the current PGO state in the Go ecosystem. During my work on the <a href=\"https://github.com/zamazan4ik/awesome-pgo\">Awesome PGO</a> project, I gathered a lot of interesting data points and insights about various PGO issues and discussed many related quirks with different stakeholders like end-users, maintainers, and application developers. We will talk about:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>PGO state across Go compilers</li>\n<li>PGO awareness across the Go industry</li>\n<li>PGO tooling issues</li>\n<li>Strengths and weaknesses of PGO modes for different use cases in real-world</li>\n<li>Top blockers for PGO adoption</li>\n<li>And many other things!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I believe that after the talk more people will be aware of PGO, aware of usual PGO blockers, and know more about how to avoid these limitations in practice.</p>\n<p>Target audience: performance-oriented Go users and Go compiler engineers</p>",

In this talk, we’ll start by exploring how Go’s current garbage collector and memory allocator work together to manage memory. Then we’ll dive into the new GreenTea GC, an experimental redesign that cleans memory in groups (“spans”) instead of object-by-object. You’ll learn how it works, why it matters, and what this “span-based” approach could mean for your Go programs in the future.</p>\n<p>I'll be exploring the Go source code: https://go.dev</p>",

These hardware-level performance characteristics are invisible to pprof but critical for optimisation.</p>\n<h2>The Solution</h2>\n<p>perf-go bridges this gap by leveraging Linux's <code>perf</code> tool and CPU Performance Monitoring Units (PMUs) to expose hardware performance counters for Go programs. It translates perf's low-level observations into pprof's familiar format, giving Go developers hardware insights without leaving their existing workflow.</p>\n<h2>What You'll Learn</h2>\n<p>In this talk, we'll:\n- Demonstrate the limitations of pprof for understanding performance bottlenecks\n- Show how perf-go exposes CPU cache behaviour, branch prediction, and memory access patterns\n- Walk through real benchmarks where we identify and fix cache-line contention issues\n- Explore how hardware counters can guide improvements that pprof alone wouldn't reveal</p>\n<h2>Target Audience</h2>\n<p>Go developers who want to optimise performance-critical code and understand the \"why\" behind their bottlenecks. Basic familiarity with profiling concepts helpful but not required.</p>",

We’ll walk through practical examples of converting existing tests to use synctest. The session includes a demo illustrating how synctest can turn an intermittently failing test into a deterministic one, and surface bugs that traditional tests might miss.</p>\n<p>Whether you build concurrent systems, maintain production Go services, or simply want more reliable tests, this talk will give you a solid understanding of what synctest brings to Go—and how you can start using it today.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Most Go codebases begin as straightforward layered monoliths, but years of growth often turn those layers into a web of hidden coupling and hard-to-predict side effects. Rewrites promise a clean slate but rarely succeed in practice. What the Go community lacks are real examples of large open source Go projects that have completed a transition to a modular monolith.</p>\n<p>This talk presents the first major open source Go project undergoing this evolution. It covers how we are moving from a decade-old layered architecture to a modular design while continuing to ship features to hundreds of production environments. This is not theory. This is architectural change in a live system with real contributors, long CI pipelines, and legacy assumptions embedded throughout the code.</p>\n<p>You will see practical strategies for decoupling features, aligning code boundaries with product teams, introducing modular service packages, and modifying database schemas without slowing ongoing development. We walk through the familiar pain points in large Go monoliths, including tight coupling, long test cycles, and frequent merge conflicts, and show how steady incremental refactoring creates a stronger and more adaptable architecture.</p>\n<p>Whether you are working on a fast-growing Go project or maintaining a mature production system, you will leave with clear and concrete techniques to modernize your architecture safely and sustainably, all without stopping feature work or risking a disruptive rewrite.</p>",

Unfortunately, there’s no simple --enable-backtrace option to enable human-readable backtraces at build time. Even worse, generating useful backtraces involves many subtle factors, and there’s no comprehensive resource that explains how to get them right.</p>\n<p>This lack of clear information arises because backtraces depend on numerous variables: your hardware architecture, operating system, distribution, compiler, build configuration, and the specific tools used to unwind the stack.</p>\n<p>In this talk, I’ll demystify how backtraces actually work and explore the key concepts behind them. I’ll also show how to leverage libunwind and minidebuginfo to obtain reliable backtraces on ARMv7 and ARMv8 systems, within the context of a Yocto-based embedded Linux distribution.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Contemporary embedded SoCs increasingly act as a network of specialized CPU cores, some dedicated to user applications, other dedicated to real time tasks, others to security. All those cores still share one set of critical peripherals, which require resource access coordination. This is increasingly implemented by making all cores talk to a dedicated core called SCP, the System Control Processor, using SCMI protocol. The SCP is responsible for coordinating access to critical resources, clock, reset, power domain, and so on. An open source firmware, SCP-firmware, can be used on the SCP to offer the SCMI services. This talk explains how to implement a port of SCP-firmware to an SCP core, what is the architecture of SCP-firmware, its initialization process, its driver or module model, how the ordering of module start up is achieved, how to implement UART and mailbox driver modules, and finally how SCMI server services are bound to modules and exposed to other cores. This is illustrated by an example code from existing SCP-firmware port to contemporary SoC.</p>\n<p>LINKS:\n- ARM SCP firmware https://gitlab.arm.com/firmware/SCP-firmware\n- SCMI specification v4.0 https://developer.arm.com/documentation/den0056/f</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Most modern embedded SoCs provide a ROM-based recovery mechanism to bootstrap an unflashed device or revive a system whose bootloader has failed. Unfortunately, these mechanisms are typically vendor-specific, poorly documented, and supported only non-standard, sometimes closed, tools. Engineers end up juggling different utilities for each SoC family, with varying user interfaces and commands.</p>\n<p>Snagboot addresses this fragmentation. It is a vendor-agnostic, fully open-source recovery and reflashing tool written in Python, with support for TI, NXP, Microchip, ST, Broadcom, Amlogic, and Xilinx platforms (and Rockchip on the way). Through its components snagrecover, snagflash, and snagfactory, Snagboot offers a unified workflow for recovery, reflashing, and factory programming. This talk will give a concise introduction to how Snagboot works and where it fits in the bring-up and manufacturing process.</p>",

Through real examples, we’ll look at what early images from a new sensor look like, and how they improve through calibration and tuning steps. We’ll cover the basic equipment and workflow needed to get started, and highlight community efforts to create an open repository of tuning data for phones, laptops, tablets, and embedded libcamera powered Linux devices.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>The embedded ecosystem is evolving rapidly, and keeping track of the most important developments has become increasingly difficult, especially outside of our current main interests. Over the past year,there have been important changes in the state of regulation, cryptography, tooling and software supply chain practices. In this talk, Marta will present a curated overview of the key trends that marked the year across both Linux and RTOS-based platforms.</p>\n<p>The session will highlight the impact of the EU Cyber Resilience Act on embedded development, recent progress in post-quantum cryptography, the growing influence of AI-assisted tooling, and notable changes in compilers and hardening features. It will also cover the state of vulnerability reporting, examples of high-impact security issues affecting embedded systems, and the maintainership challenges that arise as long-standing maintainers get closer to reaching retirement.</p>\n<p>All topics will be supported with concrete references to articles, software releases and conference talks, giving attendees a clear and actionable picture of where embedded security is heading and what to pay attention to in the coming year.</p>",

For the past five years, the IPFS ecosystem has pioneered multiple approaches to this challenge. This talk shares hard-won lessons about what works—and what doesn't.</p>\n<p>We'll cover three parallel strategies: (1) pushing for native protocol support in major browsers, (2) driving adoption of critical cryptographic building blocks (such as Ed25519 into WebCrypto API, a three-year standards journey led by Igalia that just succeeded in Chrome 137), and (3) using existing browser capabilities in novel ways.</p>\n<p>The work emerged from IPFS's needs, but the benefits extend far beyond one protocol. Ed25519 in browsers now helps decentralized identity systems, local-first apps, and any protocol needing trustless verification — all without developers bundling their own cryptography libraries.</p>\n<p>The talk will be practical and honest: What takes three years versus three months? How do you fund unglamorous infrastructure work? When should you work around browser limitations versus push for standards changes? Attendees will leave with actionable insights for pushing privacy and decentralization into mainstream web infrastructure, plus a preview of what's coming next.</p>\n<p>Links:\n- ipfs.io\n- https://blogs.igalia.com/jfernandez/2025/08/25/ed25519-support-lands-in-chrome-what-it-means-for-developers-and-the-web/</p>",

Creating a new browser engine that is sufficiently featureful to be an alternative to the Big Three is practically impossible. But what if we could shrink the footprint of a browser's core? What if a browser was little more than a WebAssembly (Wasm) runtime and nearly everything else was an extension? By breaking up the monolith we would have a chance to re-decentralize control over the web. This talk will explore what a modular web platform might look like with Wasm at its core, with a focus on how Wasm GC enables the mission-critical feature of safely sharing resources amongst components.</p>",

    "slug": "WHHWGT-in-defence-of-gnupg",
    "url": "https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/WHHWGT-in-defence-of-gnupg/",
    "abstract": "<p>For over a decade, critiques of OpenPGP and GnuPG have resurfaced in cycles: too complex, too fragile, too old, unfriendly, too “cryptonerd.” Modern messaging apps, \"forward-secrecy-by-default\" protocols, and crypto tools are frequently presented as decisive reasons to abandon GPG altogether. Yet these arguments often rely on a deeper and more troubling assumption: that ordinary users cannot and should not be expected to understand or control their own cryptographic identity.</p>\n<p>This talk challenges that premise.</p>\n<p>GnuPG is not merely another encryption tool; it is one of the few remaining technologies that give individuals total sovereign control over their cryptographic keys and consequently, over their digital identity. In an era increasingly shaped by \"digital feudalism\", where platforms dictate the limits of user agency under the guise of convenience, GPG represents a radically different model: federation instead of walled gardens, user-owned keys instead of opaque key escrow, and a trust model that distributes power horizontally rather than concentrating it in corporate or governmental authorities.</p>\n<p>This presentation revisits the popular criticisms such as complexity, usability, lack of forward secrecy, the Web of Trust, aging cryptographic primitives and examines which reflect genuine limitations and which reflect a shift in cultural expectations shaped by centralized, app-centric design. It also highlights the unique strengths of GPG: asymmetric communication without a central provider, universal applicability far beyond email, a single identity usable across code-signing, backup encryption, SSH, authentication, and fully offline communication.</p>\n<p>Finally, it explores the broader political and social context: why long term key ownership matters, why revocability and inspectability are essential freedoms, and why privacy cannot be sustainably outsourced to corporations whose incentives are misaligned with user autonomy. While modern protocols like Signal and Matrix bring important innovations, none yet replace the core promise of OpenPGP that cryptographic self determination remains possible.</p>\n<p>This talk argues that dismissing GPG as \"too hard\" risks conceding our digital agency to systems designed to keep users passive. In a world where ideas outlive the apps that package them, GPG’s foundational idea (users should own their keys) remains not only relevant, but indispensable.</p>",

Conceptually, DNSSEC's idea of tying PKI to domain names should be a better replacement -- except that in the DNS, relying on the names means trusting the registrars, registries, and ICANN. But what if we had <em>self-authenticating</em> domain names? Could we build a PKI on top of those? Could such a PKI work with unmodified mainstream web browsers like Chromium, Firefox, and Tor Browser?</p>\n<p>We've done exactly that.

Peergos combines cryptographic identity, content addressing, and decentralized access control into a unified protocol where users fully control their data, identity, and applications without relying on trusted servers.</p>\n<p>Instead of treating encryption as an add-on, Peergos integrates cryptographic capabilities directly into its data model: files, directories, social data, and application state are all encrypted and access-controlled by default. We will explain the design of Peergos’ capability-based access control, how key rotation and sharing work in practice, and how identity portability is achieved without central authorities.</p>\n<p>We will also introduce the Peergos application sandbox, which allows untrusted applications to operate over private user data without exposing plaintext or keys. This enables privacy-preserving apps such as social feeds, collaborative editing, and backups to run directly on encrypted storage.</p>\n<p>The talk will include live demos and a discussion of performance trade-offs, limitations, and open problems in decentralized encrypted systems, including search, discovery, and offline access.</p>\n<p>More info:\nhttps://peergos.org\nhttps://book.peergos.org\nhttps://github.com/peergos/peergos</p>",

Our philosophy is \"zero single point of failure\". With that in mind, we completely got rid of dependencies on DNS, and only rely on IP. Our broker can be and should be self-hosted, and forms a federation of decentralized servers.</p>\n<p>The protocol and SDK can be used to develop any kind of app, including messenger, productivity tools, editors, and social networks. All apps developed with our SDK can be built to webapp, Linux, Android, iOS, macOS and Win, thanks to the use of Tauri. All our codebase is in Rust, and MIT/Apache 2.0 of course. We recently released a new ORM mechanism that does all the heavy lifting of managing the database. Developers just need to declare the schema they want to use, and then objects are directly mapped to reactive components in React, Svelte, VueJS, via proxies and signals.</p>",

In this way, applications are decoupled from the underlying network, giving users the autonomy to choose their preferred infrastructure.</p>\n<p>In this presentation, I'll explore the space more broadly—examining why it's so exciting, why it's not fully solved yet, and where things currently stand.

We will walk through the practical challenges encountered: incompatible SBOM formats, ambiguous identifiers, conversion tools that fail in unexpected ways, and friction between ecosystem assumptions and embedded reality. The goal is to highlight what currently works, what does not, and what the community could improve to make multi-SBOM workflows feasible for embedded systems.</p>\n<p>Attendees will leave with concrete insights, pitfalls to avoid, and a clearer picture of the current limits of SBOM-based vulnerability management in complex (but totally common) embedded architectures.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Various tools producing SBOMs for pre-built artifacts, such as container images, usually provide only a flat list of components - packages, libraries, RPMs, and binaries - without explaining where any of them originated. But why does this origin information matter, and how can we obtain it?</p>\n<p>To simply introduce the concept, imagine your build ecosystem as a bakery: the built container is the loaf of bread, and your SBOM is the ingredient label on the package. While customers only see a flat list of ingredients, bakers actually care about where each one came from, because they are responsible for the quality and safety of the final product. The same applies to components in a Containerfile. As the \"building factory\", we need to know the provenance of every package, library, and binary - not just that it exists, but whether it came from a base image, a builder stage, or was installed directly in the final Containerfile. This provenance information, captured in a Contextual SBOM, is essential for effective vulnerability management. Once an issue appears, understanding vulnerability origin determines whether we must update a base or builder images, update a Containerfile-installed package, or rethink the build process entirely.  </p>\n<p>In this talk, we will show how we transform a plain, flat SBOM into a structured, layered Contextual SBOM, and what benefits this brings. We will demonstrate how contextual provenance helps us identify vulnerabilities faster and more reliably, and how it improves our overall vulnerability-management workflow.</p>\n<p>Key Topics:\n- Limitations of traditional SBOMs: Why flat, non-contextual SBOMs fall short in containerized build environments where content origin is unclear\n- Introducing Contextual SBOM: An overview of contextual SBOMs and how they enrich component data with provenance\n- Differentiation base image vs. installed content: distinguishing inherited base-image content from software added directly in the Containerfile\n- Tracing builder-stage content: Identification and attributing content copied from builder stages in multistage builds to final image\n- Using Contextual SBOMs in vulnerability management: How provenance-aware SBOMs accelerate triage, clarify responsibility, and improve remediation decisions</p>\n<p>This talk is ideal for security professionals, compliance officers, compliance auditors, developers and anyone involved in the supply chain aspects of software.</p>\n<p>Relevant repositories:\nhttps://github.com/konflux-ci/mobster\nhttps://github.com/konflux-ci/capo</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>When a new CVE surfaces in an open-source dependency, teams face an immediate question: Do we really need to update? Is the vulnerability <strong>eploitable</strong>? In practice, nearly 90% of reported issues never affect the consuming application, but identifying the critical 10% is far from trivial. Reachability analysis offers a path forward by tracing vulnerable functions from the upstream component through multi-hop call graphs to determine whether the affected code is ever invoked downstream.</p>\n<p>Despite its value, reachability analysis is notoriously difficult to automate. Most organizations still rely on manual investigation, while existing SCA tools frequently fall short, leaving teams uncertain and prompting unnecessary upgrades.</p>\n<p>This talk presents a concrete case study from Apache Hadoop and Solr, illustrating how accurate reachability analysis can prevent wasted effort, reduce noise, and focus attention on the vulnerabilities that truly matter. The reachability of vulnerabilities will be analyzed using the Open Source VEX Generation Toolset project.</p>",

With the EU’s Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) raising the bar for software transparency and lifecycle security, the need for <em>reliable, high-quality</em> SBOMs has never been more urgent.</p>\n<p>In this talk, I’ll present a practical blueprint for SBOM generation that goes beyond minimal compliance and helps projects prepare for the expectations emerging from the CRA and similar regulatory frameworks. The model breaks SBOM creation into four clear phases:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Authoring</strong> – producing the initial SBOM from a lockfile</li>\n<li><strong>Augmenting</strong> – resolving gaps and adding metadata to meet increasingly strict transparency requirements that SBOM generation tools can't do</li>\n<li><strong>Enriching</strong> – improve the quality of the SBOM using open data sets</li>\n<li><strong>Signing</strong> – provide attestation to ensure the SBOM can be trusted</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I’ll discuss the technical considerations behind each phase, common pitfalls, and how these practices help projects avoid the compliance gaps many teams are now discovering as the CRA timeline approaches.</p>\n<p>To ground everything in reality, I’ll also demo an open-source implementation of this entire workflow that runs directly inside <a href=\"https://github.com/sbomify/github-action/\">GitHub Actions</a> (or any CI environment), enabling maintainers to adopt a CRA-ready SBOM pipeline without proprietary tools.</p>",

Doing this, we understand that SBOMs are not a tool by themselves but a supporting method for various use-cases. To facilitate them, we heavily rely on FOSS tools, enriched with own logic to fit into our enterprise architecture. You love diagrams? We have them!</p>\n<p>But tools and clever ideas aren't enough. We need people to integrate them into pipelines and continuously monitor the quality of the resulting SBOMs and derived findings. We depend on cooperation from operators of related internal services.

But, the same package gets identified differently across tools, ecosystems, and standards. You end up with multiple SBOMs for the same software that can't be correlated, cross-referenced, or meaningfully compared - or actionable for vulnerability exploitability and remediation.</p>\n<p>Package-URLs (PURLs: https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec) solve the identification problem to make SBOMs actually useful. A PURL provides a universal, standardized identifier for any package across any ecosystem. This simple spec makes supply chain tooling interoperable, enabling vulnerability databases, compliance tools, and SBOM generators to speak the same language about packages, regardless of source.</p>\n<p>This talk covers the latest PURL developments that are making it essential infrastructure: validation tools, expanded ecosystem support including AI/ML model identifiers, growing adoption in major security tools and databases, integration into SBOM standards like SPDX and CycloneDX, and community-driven efforts to standardize package identification across the entire supply chain landscape. We'll show real examples where PURLs enable cross-ecosystem vulnerability tracking, make SBOM validation actually possible, and simplify compliance workflows by providing a common identifier system everyone can use.</p>\n<p>The title is provocative, but the reality is complementary: SBOMs describe your software's composition, PURLs make those descriptions machine-readable and universally meaningful. You'll leave understanding how PURLs are becoming critical infrastructure for supply chain security, why major projects and ecosystems are adopting PURL, and how to integrate PURLs into your own tooling and compliance automation workflows.</p>",

This study integrates Semantic Web technologies, graph-based dependency modelling, and function-level structural analysis to overcome these limitations. At the organisational level, diverse SBOMs, survey data, licensing details, and vulnerability records are integrated into an ontology-based knowledge graph, facilitating expressive queries and automated reasoning throughout varied software landscapes. At the project level, the Vulnerability-Dependency Graph (VDGraph) model integrates SBOM dependency details with vulnerability information from Software Composition Analysis(SCA) tools, aiding the analysis of how vulnerabilities spread through dependency chains. Ultimately, at the code level, function-call graphs described by node centrality metrics and Graph Attention Network (GAT) embeddings reflect the structural significance of functions within an application, providing insights on how updates in dependencies might influence internal behaviour.</p>\n<p>Created during an internship at CERN’s Open Source Program Office, this framework offers a complete, scalable method for understanding, managing, and safeguarding intricate software supply chains within large and heterogeneous organisations. The framework has been put in practice to perform an analysis of CERN's computing ecosystem during 2025.</p>",

SBOMs allow developers to improve the supply chain security of their Swift projects by analyzing direct and transitive dependencies for vulnerabilities. Currently, Swift Package Manager (SwiftPM) lacks built-in SBOM support, and developers must rely on third-party tools that can under- or over-represent package dependencies in a project, leading to a lack of critical information or too much noise.</p>\n<p>This talk focuses on an in-development feature to integrate SBOM generation directly into the Swift toolchain. As a result of this upcoming integration, developers will be able to create industry-standard CycloneDX or SPDX SBOMs as part of their build, without additional configuration. We will delve into the design in which SwiftPM employs the resolved modules graph to generate accurate SBOMs that capture both package and product dependencies, and optionally incorporates SwiftBuild build system’s build graph to align the SBOM with build-time conditions.</p>\n<p>Listeners will be introduced to the basics of SwiftPM, learn more about the upcoming SBOM generation design that leverages SwiftPM’s existing graph structures, and have the opportunity to provide feedback before the feature is released.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Currently QEMU hypervisor based confidential guests on SEV-SNP, SEV-ES and TDX are not at-par with other non-confidential guests in terms of restartability. For confidential guests, once their initial state is locked-in and its private memory pages are encrypted, its state is finalized and it cannot be changed. This means, in order to restart a confidential guest, a new confidential guest context must be created in KVM and private memory pages re-encrypted with a different key. Today, this means that upon restart, the old QEMU process terminates and the only way to achieve a reset is to instantiate a new guest with a new QEMU process on these systems.</p>\n<p>Resettable confidential guests are important for reasons beyond  bringing them at par with non-confidential guests. For example, they are a key requirement for implementation of the F-UKI idea [1][2]. This talk will describe some of the challenges we have faced and our experiences in implementing SEV-SNP and TDX guest reset on QEMU. A demo will be shown that reflects the current state of progress of this work. A link for the demo video will also be shared.\nThis will be mostly a QEMU centric presentation so we will also describe some fundamental concepts of confidential guest implementation in QEMU. </p>\n<p>WIP patches based on which the demo will be shown are here [3].

    "abstract": "<p>Confidential computing is rapidly evolving with Intel TDX, AMD SEV-SNP, and Arm CCA. However, unlike TDX and SEV-SNP, Arm CCA lacks publicly available hardware, making performance evaluation difficult. While Arm's hardware simulation provides functional correctness, it lacks cycle accuracy, forcing researchers to build best-effort performance prototypes by transplanting their CCA-bound implementations onto non-CCA Arm boards and estimating CCA overheads in software. This leads to duplicated efforts, inconsistent comparisons, and high barriers to entry.</p>\n<p>In this talk, I will present OpenCCA, our open research framework that enables CCA-bound code execution on commodity Arm hardware. OpenCCA systematically adapts the software stack—from bootloader to hypervisor—to emulate CCA operations for performance evaluation while preserving functional correctness. Our approach allows researchers to lift-and-shift implementations from Arm’s simulation to real hardware, providing a framework for performance analysis, even without publicly available Arm CPUs with CCA.</p>\n<p>I will discuss the key challenges in OpenCCA's design, implementation, and evaluation, demonstrating its effectiveness through life-cycle measurements and case studies inspired by prior CCA research. OpenCCA runs on an affordable Armv8.2 Rockchip RK3588 board ($250), making it a practical and accessible platform for Arm CCA research.</p>\n<p>https://github.com/opencca</p>",

The two Attesters have separate Supply Chains (one been the Workload Owner deploying the Workload) while the Platform is a different Supplier, say Intel TDX or Arm CC.\nAnother deployment could be a Workload been trained on a GPU (via means of Integrated TEE) attached to a CPU, to create an end-to-end secure environment.

    "abstract": "<p>A decade after Intel SGX’s public release, a rich ecosystem of shielding runtimes has emerged, but research on API and ABI sanitization attacks shows that their growing complexity introduces new vulnerabilities. What is still missing is a truly minimal and portable way to develop enclaves.</p>\n<p>In this talk, we will introduce our recent work on \"bare-sgx\", a lightweight, fully customizable framework for building SGX enclaves directly on bare-metal Linux using only C and assembly. The initial code was forked from the Linux kernel's selftests framework and explicitly encouraged by prominent kernel developers. By interfacing directly with the upstream SGX driver, bare-sgx removes the complexity and overhead of existing SGX SDKs and library OSs. The result is extremely small enclaves, often just a few pages, tailored to a specific purpose and excluding all other unnecessary code and features. Therefore, bare-sgx provides a truly minimal trusted computing base while avoiding fragile dependencies that could hinder portability or long-term reproducibility.</p>\n<p>Although still young, bare-sgx aims to provide a long-term stable foundation for minimal-trust enclave development, reproducible research artifacts, and rapid prototyping of SGX attacks and defenses.</p>",

    "abstract": "<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>Attested TLS is a fundamental building block of confidential computing. We have defended our position (cf. <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/bofreq-fossati-tls-exported-attestation-expat/\">expat BoF</a>) to standardize the attested TLS protocols for confidential computing in the IETF, and a new Working Group named <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/seat/about/\">Secure Evidence and Attestation Transport (SEAT)</a> has been formed to exclusively tackle this specific problem. We would like to present the <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-fossati-seat-expat/\">candidate draft</a> for standardization and gather feedback from the community, so that it can be accommodated in the standardization.</p>\n<h2>Technical details</h2>\n<p>We propose a specification that defines a method for two parties in a communication interaction to exchange Evidence and Attestation Results using exported authenticators, as defined in <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9261\">RFC9261</a>. Additionally, we introduce the cmw_attestation extension, which allows attestation credentials to be included directly in the Certificate message sent during the Exported Authenticator-based post-handshake authentication. The approach supports both the passport and background check models from the <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9334/\">RATS architecture</a> while ensuring that attestation remains bound to the underlying communication channel.</p>\n<h2>WiP Implementation</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/tls-attestation/attestation-exported-authenticators\">WiP Implementation</a> uses the <a href=\"https://github.com/veraison/rust-cmw\">veraison/rust-cmw</a> implementation of <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-rats-msg-wrap/\">RATS conceptual messages wrapper</a>. It includes a test which demonstrates using it with QUIC (for transport) and Intel TDX (as confidential compute platform): <a href=\"https://github.com/tls-attestation/attestation-exported-authenticators/blob/main/tests/quic_tdx.rs\">tests/quic_tdx.rs</a>.</p>",
