It’s also important for individuals to chart their own path that aligns with their unique experience and interest. </p>
<p>In this panel discussion, panelists will share how they got started in their career and their journey over the past two decades. For people looking for jobs in open source, we’ll discuss what we look for in candidates and why it’s not necessary to check all the boxes in job descriptions. We’ll also discuss challenges in balancing your day jobs vs. open source activities during your career. </p>
<p>In addition, we’ll also delve into other challenges and opportunities of an open source career that range from dealing with the impostor syndrome, DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) challenges, exploring open source communities for self growth, and more. </p>
<p>The goal of this session is to help attendees feel more comfortable exploring opportunities in open source and be confident in charting their own path. Our panel members will share what contributed to their success and the lessons learned throughout their extensive experience in open source. This session is meant to be interactive, and we’ll encourage attendees to ask questions and engage in the conversation.</p>",

During the year, these legislators received a great deal of help from experts across the communities to make that (even more) true! Now both instruments are in their final state, we can learn lessons how to engage over the next wave.</p>
<p>In this session we will hear an update from the authors of the legislation on how they see the last year with CRA and PLD, and insights from the open source community members who engaged to change it. We will explore how easy it is to engage with legislators over policy that will affect open source projects, and hopefully have an opportunity for audience feedback.

In our earliest days, we naïvely thought that the GPL would work like magic pixie dust; we'd sprinkle it on our code, and our code would remain free as in freedom.</p>
<p>The reality check that we've received over the last 35 years has been painful on this issue.  While this talk will cover the few huge successes in copyleft enforcement that have lead to real improvements to the rights and freedoms of users, we'll also face frankly the compromises made and false paths taken in the earliest days, that have now led to a simple but unfortunate fact: almost every Linux-based device for sale on the market today does <em>not</em> comply with Linux's license (the GPLv2).</p>
<p>This talk will not only discuss the primary past GPL enforcement efforts around the world, but also provide a whirlwind tour of how copyleft came to work in practice, how we wished it had worked, and discuss ideas, suggestions, and plans for the future strategies in copyleft that, informed by this history, are our best hope for software freedom and rights.</p>
<p>Have ever wondered how FOSS was <em>actually</em> was supposed <em>stay</em> FOSS for the long term?  Have you ever been unsure or confused why — in a world where Linux is on nearly every device —  most people cannot actually run an alternative OS build on their device?  This talk will leave you informed on these questions and prepared to participate in the next policy steps our community must take to bring back software freedom and rights to the next generation of FOSS users, activists and developers.</p>",

While “security” is a capability of open source since many years, a few years ago using open source in safety critical applications seemed to be impossible even to think about. Nowadays it has become a valid option for upcoming applications. This kind of application that should save lives, or at least not harm anyone. 
However, with advancements in technology and safety integrity standards, open source is becoming a valid option for upcoming safety critical applications. This talk will provide an overview of how open source projects approach their integration to safety critical applications. Depending on the expectations of these applications, there are different solutions to address their needs. 
The talk will introduce example projects such as ELISA, the Zephyr Project, and the Xen Project, which are currently addressing these expectations with various mechanisms and approaches.</p>",https://fosdem.org/2024/events/attachments/fosdem-2024-3209-how-open-source-projects-approach-functional-safety/slides/22267/20240203_Presentation_FOSDEM_OSS_SAFETY_Egg635h.pdf

But it is possible to collect anonymous data about how software is used in a way that respects its users and protects them from harm – and by doing so, the software's authors can make better-informed decisions about how to improve it.</p>
<p>In this presentation, I will make a case for why free software projects should want to collect data on how the software is used, and how this can be done in a privacy-respecting fashion. I will describe the anonymous metrics system in Endless OS, a desktop Linux distribution: our goals for the system, its design and implementation, the types of usage data we collect, and what we have learned from that data, as well as some shortcomings of both the system itself and the data we have.</p>
<p>I hope to encourage other free software projects, on the desktop or otherwise, to consider adopting similar techniques to better understand how their software is used.</p>",

<p>The first step of a data pipeline is <strong>ingestion</strong>, and even though we could directly ingest into a fast database, I will use <strong>Apache Kafka</strong> to ingest data. We will see how to use <strong>Python, JavaScript, and Go</strong> to send messages into Kafka.</p>
<p>Now, we need an analytics database, and for real-time data, a <strong>time-series database</strong> seems like a good match. I will demonstrate how to use <strong>QuestDB</strong>, an Apache 2.0 licensed project, to ingest and query data in <strong>milliseconds or faster</strong>.</p>
<p>Data analytics often require a <strong>graphical dashboard</strong>. For this purpose, I will use <strong>Grafana OSS</strong>, where we will create a couple of real-time charts updating <strong>several times per second</strong>.</p>
<p>And, of course, it's 2024, so you might want to delve into some <strong>data science</strong>. No worries.

While research in AI has traditionally been driven by academia, in the recent years, research companies, such as Deepmind and OpenAI, have been involved in significant breakthroughs. While in academia, there is a culture of keeping the reproducibility of scientific methods in high regard, which often goes hand in hand with making algorithms available as free or open-source software, this is not always the case in research companies.
In this talk, we explore the free and open-source software ecosystem in the AI research community and contrast this with closed source applications, of which we discuss the ethical implications from the perspective of the scientific community. As research companies such as Deepmind and OpenAI explicitly state that their mission is to develop Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), we look ahead whether the first AGI instance will be free or open-source software and discuss what the implications might be for the scientific community and society in general.</p>",

And since the kernel code executes at the highest privilege level it is very important to keep up with kernel updates to ensure the production systems are patched in a timely manner for numerous security vulnerabilities discovered almost every day.</p>
<p>Yet, because the kernel code executes at the highest privilege level and a kernel bug usually crashes the whole system, many SREs, production engineers and system administrators try to avoid upgrading the kernel too often just for the sake of stability. In many companies we have seen a tendency to create more obstacles to Linux kernel releases (requiring more approvals, harder update justifications, requiring more time in canary testing etc). But introducing all these obstacles and not treating kernel updates like any other software updates usually significantly increases the risk for the company and their service of being exploited.</p>
<p>One of the reasons SREs and production engineers are too afraid of ANY kernel upgrade is that they don’t actually know the details about Linux kernel release process and policy. This talk tries to demystify Linux Kernel releases and provides a guide on how to distinguish a kernel bugfix release from a feature release. We also try to explore why commonly established perceptions and patterns around production kernel releases are wrong and how you actually risk the stability of your systems by not releasing the kernel regularly. In the end we describe how kernel releases are implemented in our company and propose possible approaches to deploy kernel upgrades regularly with minimal risk.</p>",https://fosdem.org/2024/events/attachments/fosdem-2024-3370-an-engineer-s-guide-to-linux-kernel-upgrades/slides/22198/Linux_Kernel_Upgrades_budIIgJ.pdf

Since then the base enabling work has been done inside the Linux Kernel and at the engine and provider layer of openssl and separately in gnupg (from 2.3).  The main stumbling block in openssl, that of engine key enabling, has finally been mitigated by the openssl 3 move to providers.  The big outlier is still openssh, which won't embrace either engines or providers, but the gpg-agent can be used to provide a TPM key based ssh-agent emulation.  In this session, we'll review where we are and how to use a laptop TPM as a keystore (including a demonstration of ssh, gpg openssl and kernel based TPM keys), and where we're going including using TPM sealed keys with policy in the Linux Kernel to unlock disks under particular circumstances; the addition of localities to give keys which cannot be unsealed outside the kernel and the use of signed policies to try to counter the brittleness of PCR locking for measured boot (a signed policy key is a key that has a base policy, like locality, but which can have a set of signed policies that specify things like PCR values, which may be added to after the key was created).</p>",

These goals can be pursued through architectural modifications, such as eliminating some network hops, distributing data across multiple servers, upgrading to more powerful hardware, and so forth. This talk is not about that.</p>
<p>I categorize the primary sources of code performance degradation into three groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>Thread contention. For instance, too hot mutexes, overly strict order in lock-free operations, and false sharing.</li>
<li>Heap utilization. Loss is often caused by frequent allocation and deallocation of large objects, and by the absence of intrusive containers at hand.</li>
<li>Network IO. Socket reads and writes are expensive due to being system calls. Also they can block the thread for a long time, resulting in hacks like adding tens or hundreds more threads. Such measures intensify contention, as well as CPU and memory usage, while neglecting the underlying issue.</li>
</ul>
<p>I present a series of concise and straightforward low-level recipes on how to gain performance via code optimizations. While often requiring just a handful of changes, the proposals might amplify the performance N-fold.</p>
<p>The suggestions target the mentioned bottlenecks caused by certain typical mistakes. Proposed optimizations might render architectural changes not necessary, or even allow to simplify the setup if existing servers start coping with the load effortlessly. As a side effect, the changes can make the code cleaner and reveal more bottlenecks to investigate.</p>",

In total the group manages more than one exabyte of storage across about 2,000 data servers (60,000 disks) and 50,000 high-capacity tapes and orchestrates more than 4 exabytes of data transfers every year.  More than 30,000 users need to access these data from their computers in a user-friendly way, which has been made possible through the <a href=""https://cernbox.web.cern.ch/cernbox/"">CERNBox</a> project, CERN's open source cloud sync and share platform. The group also operates a large Ceph cluster (over 60 petabytes)  mostly to support the CERN OpenStack Cloud Computing infrastructure.</p>

The synchronization of buckets and live data has been improved by extending and enhancing powerful tools such as rclone, executed in parallel. This migration endeavor not only resulted in the successful transfer of vast amounts of data but also paved the way for the creation of a robust tool named Chorus. Chorus, specifically designed for synchronizing S3 data, emerged as a versatile solution capable of harmonizing data seamlessly across multiple cloud storage backends. This innovative tool is helpful in effective bridging of data between Ceph clusters, demonstrating the adaptability and scalability required for modern data management challenges.

<p>Namecoin uses a blockchain both to hold the names registry data and to automate the registration process itself. In the 13 years that passed since its inception, the field had additional strides of innovation, courtesy of projects such as Handshake or ENS. Recently, blockchain name systems have surged in popularity, with each blockchain having its own name system, some with a thriving developer's base and users communities.</p>

Without them, they would not be able to catch up in case of a delay. A train departing 5 minutes late would arrive at least 5 minutes late. A driver accelerating or braking a bit slower than planned would inevitably be late. The entire transportation plan would fail.</p>
<p>Those margins/allowances consist of adding extra time to the total running time. This implies planning trains with a lower speed than the maximum they could physically drive.</p>
<p>There are many ways to lower the speed of a train along its trip, but one of them is particularely efficient in terms of energy savings. The algorithm MARECO, developped by SNCF, details an entire strategy for this purpose: how to plan a train that would intelligently drives slower in a way that consume the least amount of energy ?</p>

These tools have in common a reliance on railway infrastructure simulation and results analysis.
In order to perform short-term digital capacity management (STDCM) or operational studies, a fine grained simulation of railway signaling systems is necessary.
Every country has different signaling rules, and often multiple active signaling systems, sometimes even overlapping.
This raises a challenge: how do we decouple the complexity of railway signaling and the rest of the application code, while retaining acceptable performance?
In this presentation, we will present our modeling of signaling systems and how we use it to automatically detect scheduling conflicts.</p>

Using real-world application examples, we will go over from the industry beast to the theoretical abyss, revealing the mathematical elegance inherent in state machines and its more powerful automata siblings. Bridging this gap, we will empower Erlang developers to architect solutions that go beyond conventional patterns, with concrete examples and plenty of code to read, providing the attendees with a comprehensive vision to harness the full potential of gen_statem.</p>",

Forward Error Correction (FEC) is a well-known technique for controlling errors in data transmission. The goal is to recreate a lost packet, based on other transmitted packets and redundant information included in specific FEC packets.</p>
<p>Packet losses are well handled for audio streams thanks to Packet Loss Concealment (PLC), which makes them almost un-noticeable to the end users. However, they are far more complicated to handle for video data. 
FEC offers a solution to compensate the loss rates typically observed over the Internet. At the expense of a relatively low overhead and small latency, the redundancy information transmitted by the sender lets the receiver re-create the missing packets.</p>
<p>There are currently various FEC standard techniques and approaches documented at IETF.
The Linphone project has selected the Flexible Forward Error Correction scheme (flexfec) documented in RFC8627.</p>
<p>This talk will talk about:
- the principles of Forward Error Correction
- why the Linphone team chose the Flexible Forward Error Correction scheme
- what were the implementation challenges

next level by modifying the Rust compiler to target a capability-based
architecture.</p>
<p>We will discuss CHERI, a system that enables hardware enforcement of safety
constraints at runtime using capabilities, and how we have added support for
CHERI to the Rust compiler in order to improve the security of CyberHive
Connect, an application that implements an end-to-end encrypted mesh network.</p>
<p>Connect can already boast a very high level of security when we consider the
protocols it uses, and we can argue that the application itself has many
potential vulnerabilities eliminated by being written in Rust. However, just
like most real world applications, Connect needs to make use of unsafe code in
areas such as the interface with the underlying operating system. This exposes
an attack surface in the form of code that the compiler can't guarantee will be
safe at runtime.</p>
<p>If, however, we make modifications to the Rust compiler to support transferring
knowledge about pointer provenance, bounds and other access restrictions to
CHERI's capability-based runtime enforcement, then in many cases we should be
able to eliminate the potential for unsafe situations to occur.</p>
<p>This talk will demonstrate what we have managed to achieve in terms of
producing a modified Rust compiler that can target CHERI architectures. We will
give an overview of what problems were solved by doing this and how we worked
towards getting our real world Rust application running on CHERI.</p>",

However, this shifts responsibility for ensuring memory safety to the developer. Failing to do so may lead to memory-safety violations in unsafe code, which can violate the safety of the entire application. In this talk, we explore in-process isolation with Memory Protection Keys as a mechanism to shield safe program sections from safety violations that may happen in unsafe sections. Our approach is easy to use and comprehensive, as it prevents heap and stack-based violations. We further compare process-based and in-process isolation mechanisms and the necessary requirements for data serialization, communication, and context switching. We specifically explored various Rust serialization crates such as Abomonation and bincode. Our results show that in-process isolation can be effective and efficient, permits for a high degree of automation, and also enables a notion of application rewinding where the safe program section may detect and safely handle violations in unsafe code. However, even for modestly sized arguments, the context switch cost starts to get dominated by the cost of data transfer between domains. Here, the Rust data serialization method used can significantly impact performance and thus, it is crucial to optimize it for the use case at hand.

Despite its conciseness, reading and understanding code that abstracts over the <code>Service</code> trait proves challenging because of the heavy use of generics and intricacies of implementing non-boxed futures. This complexity raises the learning curve for beginner and intermediate Rust developers to become proficient in their favorite frameworks.

<p>Bootloaders are one of the biggest pain points when it comes to booting upstream
Linux on Qualcomm devices, they require that distros support 5 versions of the Android
boot image header, weird non-standard devicetree properties, and are
generally a huge headache. As modifying the bootloader is out of the question,
we can at least replace the environment it gives us with a more sensible one...</p>
<p>In this talk, I'll give a brief introduction to what an EFI bootloader actually is,
how they work, and how U-Boot fits into the picture as a second-stage
bootloader. I'll cover the work I've been doing to improve Qualcomm support in
upstream U-Boot, and how we can drastically lower the barrier of entry for
distro support on Qualcomm phones.</p>
<p>Lastly, I'll go over the new process for porting a Qualcomm SoC to U-Boot, and
demo booting Linux with EFI runtime support on a Qualcomm phone.</p>
<p>I'll also give a sneak peak at what would be possible if we had greater ownership of our devices.</p>
<h2>Why you should care</h2>
<p>This talk is primarily aimed at the upstream community, if you work on upstream support for any Qualcomm devices - be it phone, tablet, Chromebook, or vehicle - then you can likely benefit from running U-Boot.</p>
<p>UEFI is now the lowest common denominator, and supporting it makes Qualcomm devices a viable target for more mainstream distros.</p>",https://fosdem.org/2024/events/attachments/fosdem-2024-1716-u-boot-for-modern-qualcomm-phones/slides/22104/fosdem24_aDevbas.pdf

<p>Neil will do a tour of all supported platforms, describe the work the Linaro’s Qualcomm Landing Team has achieved so far and the key features engineers are working on.
The Qualcomm SoCs are notoriously very complex and very powerful, and implementing clean, correct, maintainable and extensible support for mainline Linux is particularly hard.
Key domains like Power or DSP management were particularly hard to support, with those in good shape multimedia, connectivity and network features getting enabled permitting Qualcomm based devices to offer excellent support while running vanilla (unmodified) Linux kernel !</p>
<p>The Thinkpad X13S is a great example of such support, because until recently it was limited to expensive and hard to buy Qualcomm Reference platforms.</p>
<p>Nevertheless the Qualcomm Reference platforms also get as early as possible mainline support, without any concessions on code quality, like the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 mailing-list patches delivered on marketing announcement day.</p>

Without any knowledge of the modem stack it seemed impossibly difficult, but now we are getting some insights into how it works it is possible to see how the binary blobs are doing stuff. The way forward was to run Android and capture all the calls made to the drivers. Sailfish have some of it working, so their solution provided tools too.</p>
<p>The fixes so far are very specific, every proprietary system has its own unique way of doing things. It is a horrible standard, and no carrier even follows the standard. The modem is a black box with no outputs. To be honest, when it works, we don’t know why it works. It works perfectly well, though, so result. He would like to share his results, to discuss with the wider community how we can roll this out to get more devices supported.</p>
<p>In the recent and coming years 2G and 3G are being phased out by network operators, especially on a lot of Mobile Foss OSes that are Halium based. This means that they will be useless because you can't make calls any more. It has been extremely difficult to enable VoLTE service due to all the proprietary components.</p>

year ago, this alternative mobile OS has matured to the point of real-world
usability for a group of pilot users. In this talk, Genode developer Norman
Feske is going to share the experiences made along the way, reiterate the many
advances, demonstrate the current version, and ask: What should come next?</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Genode on the PinePhone realizes a new vision of a smartphone OS designed from
the ground up for user autonomy. Following the announcement of the very first
version at the FOSS-on-Mobile developer room in 2023, the system got into the
hands of a group of pilot users. The talk will share this experience
and highlight the key points we met towards our goal of real-world usability.</p>
<p>First, we found it important to attain a tight feedback loop between testers
and us developers, which prompted us to create a system-update mechanism that
allows for instantly updating the system, or rolling it back to any previous
version. Now, a new version can reach the hands of testers in a matter of
seconds.</p>
<p>With the quick way of testing new versions in place, the feedback we got
regarding our attempts at implementing energy-saving measures - in particular
screen blanking - was quite instructive to attain a refined solution. At a
technical level, the solution is interesting as it combines a Forth-based
custom power-management firmware with Genode's microkernel-based architecture.
Don't worry, the talk will only briefly touch those eccentricities.</p>
<p>With the power drain reduced to a practical level, we turned our
attention to the application level. The talk will briefly introduce our
SDK named Goa, which streamlines the development to the point
where almost unmodified Qt/QML-based applications can be targeted at the
Genode-based phone. To stress the latter point, we made the Linphone VoIP
stack available on this system.</p>
<p>The talk will be garnished by practical demonstrations. Besides being thrilled
to present the current state, I'm eager to gather feedback from the community
about the most worthwhile directions for the next year.</p>",https://fosdem.org/2024/events/attachments/fosdem-2024-3017-genode-on-the-pinephone-on-track-to-real-world-usability/slides/22320/genode_pinephone_fosdem_2024_PLFtr3o.pdf

Such things were often not possible back then with operating systems like Windows.</p>
<p>Now, history is repeating itself with Android and iOS. Most of the devices we buy are highly locked and restricted, limiting our ability to do what we want on these devices. Even after spending many hours recompiling the entire system or patching it, there's no guarantee of achieving satisfactory results.</p>

Over the past several years there have been significant changes, both to the development team and the codebase.  </p>
<p>The shifts in the UBPorts/PINE64 community stem from the original PinePhone port’s maintainer moving on from the project, which coincided with the release of the PinePhone Pro. This left the community at a crossroads: necessitating the search for a new maintainer and the development of a new port.  </p>
<p>A key milestone in this journey was the showcasing of an early-stage community port for the PinePhone Pro running on Ubuntu Touch 20.04 at FOSDEM last year. Since then, a new maintainer has achieved remarkable improvements, including porting 20.04 to the original PinePhone and PineTab, as well as the newly released PineTab2.  </p>
<p>This presentation will explore the challenges encountered in integrating new devices, updating existing ones, and the process of harmonizing mainline Linux with Ubuntu Touch. This is particularly crucial as Ubuntu Touch has historically leaned towards devices designed for Android/Halium-based devices, somewhat sidelining mainline Linux in the transition to 20.04. Furthermore, the discussion will extend to the future prospects of this port and its implications for Lomiri on mainline Linux across different distributions.</p>",https://fosdem.org/2024/events/attachments/fosdem-2024-2851-the-journey-to-ubuntu-touch-20-04-on-pine64/slides/22402/FOSDEM2024-Pine64UT-2_UmGaGaA.pdf

For over a decade it has been the stock rendering engine for the default browser on Sailfish OS, a Linux-based mobile operating system for use on mobile phones and tablets.</p>
<p>The browser implementation was originally developed around the EmbedLite/xulrunner API, which is no longer officially supported. This provides interesting challenges for keeping the browser up-to-date with the latest Gecko changes.</p>
<p>For the last 92 days (maybe more depending on when you're reading this) I've been <a href=""https://www.flypig.co.uk/gecko"">daily-blogging</a> about my experiences upgrading the ESR 78 Gecko rendering engine used on Sailfish OS to ESR 91. Once ESR 91 is complete the plan is to move to ESR 102 and beyond. Eventually we hope to reach a stable rhythm alongside the official Gecko releases.</p>
<p>This has been a communal effort, with other members of the Sailfish OS community helping with the development, from submitting changes to tooling to creating AI-generated images to liven up the blog posts. Many users from the community are now involved all with the singular aim of getting our Gecko upgraded. The breadth of technologies involved (Rust, C++, JavaScript, Python) makes it a fascinating project to work with and write about.</p>
<p>We've learnt a lot about the Gecko codebase in the process as well as the challenges in deploying Gecko to unusual mobile and embedded platforms. Our hope is that once we reach the latest version, we'll be able to look into contributing more changes upstream to help maintain our Gecko deployment more easily in the future. We'd love to discuss the best way to achieve this.</p>
<p>In this talk I'll share my experiences of working with Gecko in an open way and in collaboration with the community, before opening it out to a discussion about how best to work with upstream.</p>

Unfortunately, managing calendars is often a nightmare. The reason for this is simple: the big companies hosting most of the calendar services are not trying very hard to provide interroperability between their services, or facilitate the use of calendars not hosted by themselves.
One particular setting that is very painful when using calendars is the case of public-calendars. While a lot of organizations have a public-calendar available to stay informed about the events they organize, it is actually very complicated to leverage these calendars in a natural way:
First of all, not all caldav clients support public-calendars, or at least not as well as “account” calendars. Often, they allow to “bulk import” multiples ical events inside your calendar client but not suscribe to the underlying calendar. This means that new events will not be added to your calendar automatically;
    Public-calendars are not easily composable: it is not possible to merge multiple public-calendars together in order for example to share a collection of calendars;
    It is not possible to filter events in public-calendars. We may be interested only in a subset of events in a calendar (events occuring on mondays for example, or taking place in Paris, or any other criterion).</p>
<p><a href=""https://github.com/JulienMalka/Linkal"">Linkal</a> is a software developped to solve the above problems. It is a public-calendar aggregator server. It acts as a man-in-the-middle between a caldav client and some public-calendars. Given a list of public-calendar, it emulates a calendar collection containing all these calendars. The user can then use its usual caldav client and add the collection as an “account” calendar (specifying the url of the Linkal instance instead of the caldav server). This allows the collection to be shared easily to multiple users and seamlessly updated.</p>
<p>The talk will present the challenges to collaborations using calendars and the solutions that Linkal provides.</p>",

Recently, Microsoft laid off its entire ethics and society team, the team that taught employees how to make AI tools responsibly. Nextcloud on the other hand, embraces the ethics and challenges that make up today’s AI and aims to take them head on.</p>
<p>The field of AI is moving fast, and many of the new capabilities face ethical and even legal challenges.</p>
<p>For example, there are problems with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Privacy and security of user data</li>
<li>Discrimination and biases</li>
<li>Energy usage</li>
</ul>
<p>In particular with neural networks based AI technologies, the mere availability of open source code is no longer enough to be able to say you are in control over your data or that the software is safe or ethical. The set of data and the software used in the training, as well as the availability of the final model are all factors that determine the amount of freedom and control a user has.</p>
<p>Until Hub 3, we succeeded in offering features like related resources, recommended files, our priority inbox and even face and object recognition without reliance on proprietary blobs or third party servers.</p>
<p>Yet, while there is a large community developing ethical, safe and privacy-respecting technologies, there are many other relevant technologies users might want to use. We want to provide users these cutting-edge technologies – but also be transparent. For some use cases, ChatGPT might be a reasonable solution, while for other data, it is paramount to have a local, on-prem, open solution. To differentiate these, we developed an Ethical AI Rating.</p>
<p>Our Ethical AI Rating is designed to give a quick insight into the ethical implications of a particular integration of AI in Nextcloud. We of course still encourage users to look more deeply into the specific solution they use, but hope that this way we simplify the choice for the majority of our users and customers.</p>
<p>I will describe how our Ethical AI rating works, and give a bunch of examples. And, as a bonus, show how it is integrated in Nextcloud and how it can help you get work done - without leaking your data!</p>
<p>I look forward to any feedback you wonderful folks in the audience have.</p>",https://fosdem.org/2024/events/attachments/fosdem-2024-3134-another-approach-to-ai/slides/22280/AI_xdZxVn8.pdf

It is also the only one I am aware of where user research was done on authors, to help evaluate accessibility. We need more of this.  </p>
<p>Currently, Environmental Sustainability in the CMS space is given even less of a priority than accessibility. We are in a climate crisis, digital tools are contributing to it, global best practices are emerging, but adoption of these best practices isn't happening fast enough. Collaboration is needed to both raise awareness within our industry, but also find common solutions. Finding common approaches to measure the CO2 impact is an important starting point. Much more will be needed if we are to help the web make significant reductions in energy consumption. </p>
<p>These are two places where collaboration is key if we are able to make the advances which are needed for people with disabilities, as well as future generations. Where can we help to optimize our development process, code execution, and the cumulative impact of CO2 produced through the process.</p>",

<p>In this talk, we want to focus on the ""developer-friendly"" part, and demonstrate the steps it takes to turn FlexMeasures into a smart backend, for instance to power the intelligent scheduling in your new climate tech startup! (you can also tinker with this at home, of course)</p>
<p>In this highly relevant example, we assume you control the heating for your customers' buildings. There is a heat pump and solar panels. You promise your customers to heat their home with their own solar power if possible. You even promise to use the cheapest grid power when the sun isn't shining. Green building, low energy bill!</p>
<p>Our tutorial will turn this promise into reality ― in any case, the data-driven optimal computations you'd need (measuring and on/off control of hardware not included).</p>
<p>FlexMeasures is a Flask web server, so this tutorial will use Python.
We will use the FlexMeasures API, but also its CLI and the Python client ― the possibilities are rich. We also show how to add custom logic in a FlexMeasures plugin.</p>
<p>In short, we will:</p>
<ul>
<li>create a new customer account with the relevant asset models for this use case (via a new API endpoint, e.g. called from your CRM)</li>
<li>feed local measurements (e.g. solar, temperature) regularly into your FlexMeasures server, using the FlexMeasures Python client</li>
<li>get the latest price and weather forecast data from third-party-APIs (regularly via cron jobs), using existing FlexMeasures plugins</li>
<li>create forecasts for solar data and prices (regularly via cron jobs)</li>
<li>call the FlexMeasures scheduler to compute when to draw green &amp; cheap electricity for heating (via the FlexMeasures API) which you can out to use in the building</li>
<li>define a cost reporter and let it run (regularly via cron jobs)</li>
<li>configure a FlexMeasures dashboard to show the relevant data in one place</li>
</ul>
<p>We hope to see you there, and that some of you get inspired to put some climate tech into the field!</p>",https://fosdem.org/2024/events/attachments/fosdem-2024-2509-using-flexmeasures-to-build-a-climate-tech-startup-in-15-minutes/slides/22093/Nicolas-FlexMeasures-FOSDEM2024_vH7R3C7.pdf

In my presentation I will introduce groundbreaking extensions to OCPP, focusing on the integration of end-to-end digital signatures and binary data streams, a leap forward in efficiency and security within the EV charging ecosystem.  </p>
<p>The integration of binary data streams via HTTP Web Sockets into OCPP marks a significant enhancement in data transmission efficiency. This approach not only reduces latency and bandwidth usage for large data transfers, but also paves the way for more secure, in-band data transmissions like firmware updates or log file transport. Traditionally, such data transfers required separate HTTP or FTP servers, introducing unnecessary complexity and potential network security risks. With these extensions firmware updates become seamless and more secure, directly within the OCPP framework.  </p>
<p>Furthermore, the addition of digital signatures to OCPP commands and data structures, such as charging tariffs or grid related commands for controllable consumers according to the German §14a EnWG, introduce a new layer of security and integrity. These signatures ensure that data is not tampered with during transmission - even beyond the traditional scope of OCPP - providing a verifiable trust mechanism in end-to-end EV charging communications and might in the future lead to more cost-efficient intelligent measuring systems. </p>
<p>A notable advancement is the use of digital signatures for creating distinct user roles within OCPP. Until now, OCPP lacked the capability to differentiate between user access levels, such as ""normal"" users and ""admin"" users. The introduction of role-based access control, underpinned by digital signatures, allows for precise management of user permissions, enhancing both security and operational efficiency especially in more complex managed charging locations.  </p>
<p>In my talk, I will delve into the technical implementation details of these extensions. Attendees will gain insights into the practical applications and benefits of these enhancements in the context of the Open Source energy ecosystem. The presentation will also explore the potential future implications and developments that these extensions could usher in, setting the stage for a more secure, efficient, and scalable EV charging infrastructure.</p>",https://fosdem.org/2024/events/attachments/fosdem-2024-2155-enhancing-ocpp-with-e2e-security-and-binary-data-streams-for-a-more-secure-energy-ecosystem/slides/22132/OpenChargingCloud_FOSDEM2024_2024-02-03_5uSL8wJ.pdf

By leveraging over a decade of experience in EV charging software, at S44 we are actively working towards making EV charging more attainable and equitable. 
In our quest for a greener future, we face a pivotal challenge: by 2030 50% of new U.S. cars will be EVs, but today 28% of chargers in leading cities don't work. Developers must build innovative software to improve and grow the charging network so EV owners can travel with confidence. 
By creating an open source charge station management system, CitrineOS's goal is to  provide the fuel for this change. The project is NEVI compliant, globally available and open to all. CitrineOS is meant to offer a community driven, reliable CSMS that builds a foundation for market participants to innovate on top of a protocol implementation instead of re-inventing the same wheel. 
The project drives forward the adoption of the OCPP 2.0.1 protocol resulting in more reliable charging networks worldwide.
Our hope is that anyone looking to bootstrap a modern charging network, or upgrade an existing one from OCPP 1.6 to OCPP 2.0.1, will consider CitrineOS as their starting point, and that increased community involvement will continue to improve the charging experience delivered by this open source project.

Providing access to energy is a critical and complex challenge as most unelectrified people live in extremely remote and hard-to-reach areas, often having limited mobile network connectivity, unknown (future) demand patterns, and extreme weather conditions combined with very low purchasing power of the affected population. 
The power of Open Source is still completely underrepresented in technological innovations in this sector. We are working towards improving this situation and will showcase one of our flagship examples: An Open Source Battery Management System (BMS) specifically developed for off-grid energy application. Energy storage and its related technologies are key to any off-grid energy application and the Libre Solar BMS has been specially developed for this use case. We will deep dive into the design decisions and features, covering hardware, firmware and an app. The BMS was developed leveraging solely open source tools: The PCB is designed in KiCad, the firmware runs on Zephyr RTOS and the communication interfaces use the ThingSet protocol over various lower layers like Serial, CAN, WebSocket or MQTT. The hardware went through three design iterations and has been lab and field-tested by several organizations.
We will conclude and show why this kind of Open Source technology is of such great importance to bring power to the people in both the sense of bringing electricity literally and also creating the grounds for local value creation in the affected geographies. We invite the whole Energy Open Source community to contribute with their efforts to where the contributions can be most impactful on various levels. The Open Source BMS is one great piece, but we need much more of those.</p>",https://fosdem.org/2024/events/attachments/fosdem-2024-2645-power-to-the-people-technology-for-access-to-energy/slides/22268/FOSDEM_Power_to_the_People_-_Technology_for_Acc_2mbPaEL.pdf

To ensure grid security, TSOs (transmission system operators) have ways of relieving these grid constraints, commonly called ""remedial actions"". These actions may or may not be costly.<br />
The European electricity grid is highly meshed, spanning upon multiple countries and TSOs. National grids are no longer independent: every event can have a spill-over effect across the whole continent. Two of the most important consequences are:<br />
- TSOs can ""pollute"" other TSOs' grids with unnecessary electrical flows, putting a strain on their national grids;<br />
- Optimizing the cost of grid operation (i.e. of remedial action implementation) is no longer a national problem, but a global one.  </p>
<p>Thus, it becomes necessary to optimize the operation of the EU grid on a large scale and implement an agreed method to share its costs. 
Developing open-source tools to achieve these goals has benefits with robustness, transparency, auditability, and re-usability.</p>",https://fosdem.org/2024/events/attachments/fosdem-2024-2640-sharing-the-operational-cost-of-europe-s-electricity-grid-optimization-and-transparency-through-open-source/slides/22290/OpenRAO_FlowDecompo_-_FOSDEM_2024_dD6v6cp.pdf

Unlike fossil fuels, renewable energies are unpredictable in terms of power generation from one hour to the next. In order to balance the grid, operators need an accurate daily estimate of when and how much PV and other renewable energies will be generated. </p>
<p>Open Climate Fix (OCF) is an open-source (OS) AI company using machine learning (ML) to respond to the need for accurate renewable energy forecasts. Connecting energy industry practitioners with ML researchers doing cutting-edge modelling is our aim, and one way we seek to do this is by making much of our code open-source (https://github.com/openclimatefix). </p>
<p>In the energy space, OCF’s first focus is on solar nowcasting (short-term forecasting). Our main deep learning model takes in real-time PV data, numeric weather predictions, satellite images, as well as regional grid data, and outputs probabilistic solar electricity nowcasts for solar production systems in the UK. What makes our approach unique is teaching cloud dynamics to the model using satellite data. </p>
<p>Our 36-hour forecast, Quartz Solar, is currently used by National Grid, the UK grid operator, as a decision-making tool in their control room. Building on this forecast, we are working on a new open-source model, <a href=""https://github.com/openclimatefix/Open-Source-Quartz-Solar-Forecast"">Quartz Solar OS</a>, that we want everyone (maybe FOSDEM attendees!), not just grid operators, to be able to use. </p>
<p>The talk OCF proposes will present the ML techniques used to develop Quartz Solar OS and the possible use cases and climate impact such a forecast could have. And yes, we’re hoping to have a demo!</p>",https://fosdem.org/2024/events/attachments/fosdem-2024-2960-quartz-solar-os-building-an-open-source-ai-solar-forecast-for-everyone/slides/22319/Open_Quartz_-_Building_an_Open_Source_AI_Solar_H7g4i20.pdf
2614,2024-02-03,16:00,25,H.2214,Energy: Reimagining this Ecosystem through Open Source devroom,Can open source development drive energy transition? PyPSA-Earth experience,fosdem-2024-2614-can-open-source-development-drive-energy-transition-pypsa-earth-experience,https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/event/fosdem-2024-2614-can-open-source-development-drive-energy-transition-pypsa-earth-experience/,"<p>The energy transition implies making decisions under deep uncertainties. Modelling is known to be effective in providing the evidence needed to shape the transformation of the energy sector in the most cost-effective way. Open source is a known approach to increase accessibility of the energy modelling tools. That led to a rapid increase in a number of available energy models whose development is mainly driven by the academic community. However, developments have focused on a few world regions, where awareness of climate change is high. There is still a coverage gap, especially for countries where the energy sector is still highly dependent on fossil fuels.</p>
<p><a href=""https://github.com/pypsa-meets-earth/"">PyPSA meets Earth initiative</a> aims to address this gap by building a global community focused on developing an ecosystem of Pythonic tools, including the modelling framework <a href=""https://github.com/pypsa-meets-earth/pypsa-earth"">PyPSA-Earth</a>. The framework may be utilised to build a ready-to-use regional power system model by extracting all the required data in a workflow orchestrated by Snakemake. A community approach enables the participation of regional experts in the development and brings modelling closer to real-life applications. </p>
<p>One of the issues found along this route was the lack of ready-to-use tools to integrate the effects of climate change into power system models. A climate development track in PyPSA-Earth addresses this task and aims to implement approaches to account for changes of climate inputs in a physically correct, yet computationally feasible way. To deal with the regional features of national power systems in a systematic way, a country-wise functionality testing has been carried out. As a result, PyPSA-Earth has been adjusted to be fully capable of building a power system model for any country in the world by a single line of code.</p>
<p>The presentation will give an overview of the challenges encountered along this way and guide trough the use cases of PyPSA-Earth to tackle the challenges of the energy transition around the globe.</p>",https://fosdem.org/2024/events/attachments/fosdem-2024-2614-can-open-source-development-drive-energy-transition-pypsa-earth-experience/slides/22346/Fedotova_PyPSA-Earth_kzT8Ior.pdf

The objective is to determine the energy consumption and link it to carbon emissions of hardware devices and software applications (processes). This infrastructure allows the programmers and users to see which hardware devices and processes are responsible for the system's energy consumption and carbon emissions. These statistics are extremely useful for both user-level applications and kernel developers.</p>
<p>Major objectives in this talk would include a detailed discussion on the development of the required infrastructure and multivariate regression models to determine application and hardware device energy consumption. FOSSDEM would be a great platform to present the work done so far to the open-source software developer community and get feedback to further improve and fine-tune models toward better predictions. There are also privacy concerns attached to this data, which need feedback from more developers.</p>",https://fosdem.org/2024/events/attachments/fosdem-2024-1885-carbon-measurement-and-energy-attribution-for-processes-and-hardware-devices-in-the-linux-kernel/slides/22372/FOSDEM_Brussels_2024-1_GSslAP8.pdf

However, the presentation is specifically aimed at analyzing the Linux software stack  - inclusive kernel - of embedded products. It shows how embedded Arm64 systems differ from Intel/AMD systems and what impact this has on the power management software design. The presentation gives concrete insights on how to identify wakeups, the impact of scaling governors and many other subsystems of the kernel. The talk is intermixed by numerous practical examples, which should enable the listener to autonomously analyze and optimize the power consumption for complex embedded systems.</p>
<p>The talk has no prerequisites for the audience. Topics such as scheduling or CPU frequency governors are introduced in the talk. Of course, the listener should have a basic understanding of a Linux system and at least a basic understanding of concepts such as processes and interrupts.</p>
<p>Even if the talk focuses on an embedded system, the knowledge provided can, with a few exceptions, also be transferred to a server system. So there is no reason for amd64 people to be left out!</p>
<p>In addition, a new power management kernel analyzer tool will be introduced and its use, which is not yet available in the kernel upstream tree. Further, discussions about a more flexible, eBPF based CPUIdle governor and other research topics are introduced and can be discussed.</p>",

Wind farms today boast higher capacity factors, indicating that they are producing more energy relative to their installed capacity. Improved design, coupled with advancements in predictive analytics and control systems, have optimized the performance of wind turbines, making them more reliable and productive. The interest in renewable energy and, particularly, in wind power accelerated dramatically as the war in Ukraine took place. For the first time in history the investment in renewables was the primary response to an energy crisis. The increase in wind power capacity involves some new challenges. Older wind turbines are more prone to failure due to aging and at the same time this must be predicted as accurately as possible for the newer ones, based on data collected in real-time in the field. Predictive maintenance can save a lot of time and money by having the right number of spare parts in stock in the right location. Applying DevOps principles to Big Data predictive analytics can help optimize the use of resources and workflows. This produces major improvements to the spare part recommendation based on IoT data. This presentation illustrates how DevOps practices and related Open-Source tools help build an efficient software infrastructure where wind turbines lifetime predictions and spare part stock recommendations are delivered regularly to service engineers.</p>",https://fosdem.org/2024/events/attachments/fosdem-2024-2367-how-can-open-source-help-the-wind-power-industry-/slides/22425/2024-02-03_IW_Digitalization_FOSDEM_tRfhgWh.pdf

GDS applications require a series of data processing steps, such as extracting data from tabular sources into a graph of nodes and relationships, cleaning and transforming the graph, extracting node features, and finally moving data into a GDS package, such as NetworkX and PyTorch Geometric for graph analytics. These steps can be performed easily and efficiently by GDBMSs, which provide high-level graph-based data models and query languages to developers. Kùzu is a GDBMS designed to serve as an essential storage system for GDS developers.</p>
<p>Kùzu's embedded architecture makes it very easy to import as a library without a server setup and also provides performance advantages.

The plugin makes it possible to use pytest to perform tests on containers and software inside containers. You don’t have to take care of pulling images, building them, or picking ports on the host. You just describe your container setup and pass it to a test function. In return, the plugin gives you a connection to the container. Using the connection, you can verify the container’s state using the testinfra python framework. The plugin even cleans up after itself when you’re done.</p>
<p>In short, <code>pytest_container</code> makes it possible to write tests in Python: no need to build your own framework from scratch or worry about the boring container plumbing tasks.</p>

dependability, security, and maintainability of software systems. Although
several factors, including the build environment, have been investigated in the
context of non-reproducible builds, to the best of our knowledge the precise
influence of configuration options in configurable systems has not been
thoroughly investigated.  This presentation aims at filling this gap.  This
presentation thus proposes an approach for the automatic identification of
configuration options causing non-reproducibility of builds. It begins by
building a set of builds in order to detect non-reproducible ones through binary
comparison. We then develop automated techniques that combine statistical
learning with symbolic reasoning to analyze over 20,000 configuration
options. Our methods are designed to both detect options causing
non-reproducibility, and remedy non-reproducible configurations, two tasks that
are challenging and costly to perform manually.  We evaluate our approach on
three case studies, namely Toybox, Busybox, and Linux, analyzing more than 2,000
configurations for each of them. Toybox and Busybox come exempt from
non-reproducibility. In contrast, 47% of Linux configurations lead to
non-reproducible builds. The approach we propose in this presentation is capable
of identifying 10 configuration options that caused this
non-reproducibility. When confronted to the Linux documentation, none of these
are documented as non-reproducible. Thus, our identified non-reproducible
configuration options are novel knowledge and constitutes a direct, actionable
information improvement for the Linux community. Finally, we demonstrate that
our methodology effectively identifies a set of undesirable option values,
enabling the enhancement and expansion of the Linux kernel documentation while
automatically rectifying 96% of encountered non-reproducible builds.</p>",https://fosdem.org/2024/events/attachments/fosdem-2024-2848-documenting-and-fixing-non-reproducible-builds-due-to-configuration-options/slides/22297/randrianaina_fosdem24_E1Rilkq.pdf

As such, it is essential to target GPUs when running on such powerful machines. Given the desire for portability of applications, OpenMP offloading is a popular way to accelerate applications on GPUs.</p>
<p>This talk presents the ROCm OpenMP offloading compiler from two perspectives: compiler flags and compiler/runtime implementation. Given that it may be critical to use the right compiler flags, the talk presents some of the tuning knobs that the ROCm OpenMP compiler exposes to users. It will go into more detail of what optimization, feature, and parameter the specific compiler flags enable. For each of the compiler flags listed, the talk will present information on what occurs in the compiler and the runtime library. For several of these switches, the talk presents performance results.</p>
<p>In particular, the talk covers the high-level flag <code>-fopenmp-target-fast</code> and what optimizations are enabled by that switch. It will then go into more detail about the specific flags for the selected underlying optimizations and their user-facing parameter options that allow for fine-tuning in certain scenarios. Specifically, the talk covers the following flags:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>-fopenmp-gpu-threads-per-team</code>: This switch controls kernel launch parameters considered during the compiler’s code generation phase, which can impact things like register allocation.</li>
<li><code>-fopenmp-target-big-jump-loop</code>: This switch enables a more optimized form of loops for running on the GPU that is closer to traditional block-languages like CUDA or HIP.</li>
<li><code>-fopenmp-target-no-loop</code>: This switch enables the generation of CUDA-like code without any loop executed on the device. The talk outlines which conditions must be met to allow the compiler to generate such GPU code.</li>
<li><code>-fopenmp-target-xteam-reductions</code>: A special form of reduction kernels that can greatly benefit the performance of reductions. One of its main tuning knobs is the blocksize.</li>
<li><code>-fopenmp-target-xteam-reduction-blocksize</code>: The xteam reductions blocksize and what are the implications.</li>
<li><code>-fopenmp-force-usm</code>: This flag is a convenient switch that enables the compiler to emit code as if the user specified <code>#pragma omp unified_shared_memory</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the compiler flags, the runtime offers additional configurability via environment variables. Some of these variables influence the very same mechanisms, whereas other provide separate mechanisms. The talk gives an overview of some of these variables and how they influence execution.</p>

The key goal of PyPartMC is to provide a maintainable multi-platform pip-installable package enabling interoperability between the Python ecosystem and the internal components of PartMC – an open-source aerosol dynamics simulation package. The wrapped <a href=""https://lagrange.mechse.illinois.edu/partmc"">PartMC package</a> has been in active development for almost two decades and is used in computational research ranging from process studies on ice formation in clouds to large-scale simulations of air pollution evolution coupled with weather forecasting models. PartMC has a modular, test-covered, pseudo-OOP, Fortran 90 codebase; several C and Fortran dependencies (SUNDIALS, MPI, netCDF, SuiteSparse, ...); and a bespoke config-file subsystem supporting nested files for variable-size input.</p>
<p>Developing PyPartMC, we aim to provide added value to both the existing community of PartMC users, accustomed to the Fortran/HPC ecosystem, as well as to a wider community potentially daunted by the entry threshold pertinent to the multiple steps needed to obtain, compile, setup and run PartMC, and analyse its output. Steps which so far involved usage of diverse tools and languages, and which are meant to be achievable in a single computational research environment such as Python, Julia or Matlab. </p>
<p>To this end, PyPartMC is available at pypi.org in form of both source (with all 10+ dependencies in git submodules) as well as binary packages (Linux, Windows and macOS). Binary packages have all the dependencies statically linked, what is orchestrated using CMake via standard wheel-building logic. The design features: (i) employment of unmodified Fortran code of the wrapped PartMC package; (ii) binding logic implemented in C++ using pybind11; (iii) garbage collection of Fortran derived type instances; (iv) a drop-in i/o layer replacement matching the Fortran config-file subsystem API, which C++ sees as nlohmann::json objects, and which quacks like ordinary dicts from Python perspective. On top of that, a thorough test coverage including Github-Actions-hooked checks for interoperability with Matlab's built-in Python bridge and with Julia (using PyCall.jl).</p>

This talk will explain these developments, including new support for fully rootless builds and installs of Apptainer, ways Apptainer now leverages the Linux user namespace for some of its features, innovations in using Apptainers with MPI and fabric adaptors, and the usefulness of ORAS protocol in software supply chain management and its current state of integration with OCI registries.</p>

This allows very fast and efficient algorithms to search for and retrieve data (based on its semantic meaning) from large datasets. DASI is modular and is compatible with multiple backends (e.g., POSIX, CEPH, DAOS) through a diverse API (Python, C++, C).

The costs, historical lack of focus on performance, and lack of transparency about supply of cloud resources is problematic. The lack of consistent, automated orchestration on HPC poses challenges for running complex emerging workflows. Cloud is growing rapidly and is projected to be the largest sector of computing by revenue 2025. Cloud's market-favored position makes it a primary source and beneficiary of innovations, allowing it to address limitations of HPC. HPC needs a strategy for integrating cloud technologies and collaborating with the cloud community. If our HPC community cannot successfully integrate cloud technologies and techniques we (and our science) will be left behind. </p>
<p>To establish this foundation the community must adopt a new strategy - converged computing, or creating environments and technologies that combine the best of both worlds. In this talk I will discuss our innovative work toward this goal – implementing HPC technologies inside of Kubernetes, the de-facto standard workload orchestration framework, and Kubernetes inside of HPC. I will provide a brief history of our early work, including improving the default Kubernetes scheduler by way of testing more sophisticated graph-based scheduling (a project called Fluence), and implementing the entirety of an HPC workload manager inside of Kubernetes (the Flux Operator). Finally, I present the ultimate turducken - allowing for running machine learning and HPC applications (including the Flux Operator itself) inside of Kubernetes, inside of Flux. With this approach, we imagine a collaborative future where HPC users can deploy workloads seamlessly across environments, and encounter equality of automation and performance. </p>

The source code for RHEL spent many years being released for free as CentOS Linux, but is now only available through the Red Hat customer interface, limiting access to those who commit to following its user agreements. Those user agreements then limit the use and redistribution of that code. The situation is complicated: While Red Hat claims this is compliant with open source definitions, some NGOs and OSS opinions differ.</p>
<p>At the same time, we see an expansion of the adoption of open core, and even gatherings of opencore supporters at their own events (https://opencoresummit.com/). Organized by investment capital firms (https://oss.capital/) and defining ""COSS"" (commercial open source software) as the best OSS ever, these events celebrate a disruptive and highly commercial approach to open source. More and more companies are adopting the open core model with varying degrees of success, while Amazon and other companies are moving away from companies using the open core model, embracing ""truly free"" software.</p>
<p>One thing is for sure: many of the companies adopting open core model  have very effective legal departments and a lot of experience. But how should we - the open source community handle this? Many of us volunteer for open source projects, and the very lucky ones are employed to work on open source projects, but that, too, can bring in a competing motivation. </p>
<p>From open source projects that are backed by commercial companies needing to provide value to continue to receive the very real funding the projects need, to projects with no commercial backing and massive contributor communities, the answer is likely to be nuanced. How do we ensure the success and continued adoption of open source philosophies while finding a way to call out and de-incentivize openwashing?</p>

The PostgreSQL project is not sponsored by a single company or association, which makes all of this even more complicated. We had to figure a lot of this out on our own (with legal help), and there was not the same wealth of information available like for example for copyright.

This leaves one wondering whether the courts would order a defendant to no longer distribute the software at issue at all. This question essentially goes to section 4 of the GPLv2; the so called termination clause. A look into the German Civil Code (sect. 534) reveals us that such automatic termination clauses have to be read as rescission clauses (i.e. as manual termination). We will then look at the sections of the Civil Code which deals with rescission in generally and learn about the separation principle.

There are a variety of strategies and tools available for such a transition to choose from. In this session, we will see one of these strategies, in which workloads keep running in virtual machines alongside containers on top of OKD, based on our recent experience in migrating real-world virtual machines from oVirt to KubeVirt using Forklift.</p>
<p>In mid-2023, our engineering team at Red Hat took the task of migrating all the virtual machines from an internal oVirt environment to a new OKD deployment. Our oVirt environment was in use for more than a decade, running hundreds of production VMs as well as VMs for development purposes. Given the nature of the workloads, it was impractical, and in some cases not even possible, to containerize the workloads. Therefore, we decided to go ahead and take Forklift for a spin, and move the VMs to run on OKD using KubeVirt, with minimal changes to the workloads that run inside them.</p>
<p>At first glance, this kind of migration appears fairly straightforward, doesn't it? Especially considering we now have access to mature tools for VM migrations, like virt-v2v and ovirt-imageio, that are orchestrated by the Forklift operator. And specifically, when migrating from oVirt to KubeVirt, the same virtualization stack is used on both ends. However, in reality, the migration process was more complex than anticipated, with quite a few factors to consider and operations that were needed to complement the functionality in Forklift.</p>
<p>This session presents tips and insights for migrations from legacy virtualization platforms to OKD, through our test case of transitioning from oVirt to OKD using Forklift. Without assuming prior knowledge of the platforms and tools discussed, we will cover the entire migration process using Forklift, and explain scripts we implemented and strategies we used for a smooth transition to OKD. Join us to learn from our journey, so by the end of this session you will have a clear understanding of the necessary steps to successfully execute your organization's transition projects.</p>",https://fosdem.org/2024/events/attachments/fosdem-2024-3003-from-virtualization-platform-to-hybrid-cloud-solution-a-hands-on-account/slides/22150/From_Virtualization_Platform_to_Hybrid_Cloud_So_zXITLxd.pdf

To support Android as a guest, the Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM) requires a set of virtual hardware like sound, video and networking. In this context, VirtIO has spreaded as a standard interface for virtual devices. Having VirtIO for hardware allows Android to be deployed in different VMMs that support VirtIO like Crosvm or QEMU. This talk presents the current efforts to implement virtio-sound for infotainment systems in automotive. The implementation of virtio-sound can be split into two: the device or backend and the driver or the frontend. Generally speaking, the driver runs in the guest OS and it is not different from other sound drivers. The sound driver exposes an API to the user-application in guest and then communicates to the device to serve those requests like playing a sound or recording audio. The device usually runs in the host and processes the requests that come from the driver. There are different ways to implement the device, e.g., as a built-in device in QEMU, using vhost or vhost-user. In this talk, we talk about our decision to implement virtio-sound as an vhost-user device. In this case, the device runs in the host machine as a separate process independent of the QEMU process. This deployment has benefits like reducing the attack surface of QEMU and also enables more granularity in setting up rights for the device process. Our implementation is able to handle different audio backends by relying on a generic interface. Currently, we support the pipewire and Alsa as audio backends. During this presentation, we propose to share our journey in building the virtio-sound device, including improving its specification, fixing bugs in the virtio-sound driver, and building it as a rust-vmm project. We also plan to outline a roadmap for the future like adding support for other audio backends like Gstreamer.</p>",https://fosdem.org/2024/events/attachments/fosdem-2024-1910-making-virtio-sing-implementing-virtio-sound-in-rust-vmm-project/slides/22175/implementing_virtio-sound_in_rust-vmm_project_HhqbjPY.pdf

This package installs a provisioning machine, which uses the below components:</p>

<li>DHCP server (isc-dhcp-server)</li>
<li>PXE boot server (tftp-hpa)</li>
<li>web server (apache2)</li>
<li>puppet-master</li>
</ul>
<p>Once computers in the cluster boot for the first time, a Debian live system is served by OCI over PXE, to act as a discovery image. This live system then reports the hardware features back to OCI. Computers can then be installed with Debian from that live system, configured with a puppet-agent that will connect
to the puppet-master of OCI. After Debian is installed, the server reboots, and OpenStack services are provisioned, depending on the server role in the cluster.</p>
<p>OCI is fully packaged in Debian, including all of the Puppet modules. After installing the OCI package and its dependencies, no other artificat needs to be installed on your provisioning server, meaning that if a local debian mirror is available, the OpenStack cluster installation can be done completely
offline.
This presentation will introduce OpenStack Cluster Installer, and explain how it works, its general principle, and why it's a very good solution to manage your OpenStack deployment on Debian.</p>

You can attach multiple network interfaces using Multus, but you'll need to specify every detail. </p>
<p>Virtualized workloads have extra requirements from the network, given their stateful nature. For instance, they require their IP addresses to be preserved during their life-cycle, and also during live migration. Currently, since the network does not provide these features, the network-admin must deploy and configure extra services in the network. </p>
<p>But, what if you had a SDN (software defined network) to take care of that, and while doing so abstract how to bridge hybrid infrastructure, from bare metal, to virtualized, to public cloud environments? </p>
<p>Join us to learn and understand how these features can be used to provide Kubernetes workloads access to physical networks (protected by network policies)  through a live demo.
The multi-network feature is paramount to delivering non-cloud deployments with enough flexibility for their use cases: connecting to the physical networks of their data-centers is extremely important, since some of their services are not deployed in Kubernetes. For security reasons, access to/from the workloads running in Kubernetes should be governed by network policies. OVN-K multi-networking also provides an opinionated network fabric that can automate what users previously had to specify in detail, simplifying configuration and cost of operation for cloud providers and admins.</p>
<p>While any pod will benefit from the above, KubeVirt workloads (VMs) will get more juice out of this SDN implementation. While the feature-set available today is good enough to allow users of traditional virtualization platforms to lift-and-shift their existing workloads into KubeVirt, the features in the pipeline are game changers: VM workloads requires things from the network a pod wouldn’t normally ask for, such as preserving the IP during its life cycle, and also during migration (so the established TCP connection can survive being moved to a different Kubernetes node). These features are a really good match for OVN-Kubernetes since OVN already provides some migration-centered improvements used on other platforms (i.e. Openstack) which can be re-used to provide seamless live-migration of the VM workloads.</p>",https://fosdem.org/2024/events/attachments/fosdem-2024-1708-one-sdn-to-connect-them-all/slides/22246/FOSDEM_2024_SDN_for_all_the_networks_IlptGCA.pdf

access to? They want to know e.g. how many threads they can run in parallel for
their threadpool size, or the number of thread-local memory arenas, etc.</p>
<p>The kernel offers many endpoints to query this information. There is
/proc/cpuinfo, /proc/stat, sched_getaffinity(), sysinfo(), the cpuset cgroup
hierarchy's cpuset.cpus.effective, the isolcpus kernel command line parameter,
/sys/devices/system/cpu/online. Further, libcs offer divergent implementations
of sysconf(_SC_NPROCESORS_ONLIN). As a bonus, the kernel scheduler may be
configured to limit resources using cpu ""shares"" or cpu quotas, so a task may
be able to run on all cores, but have some kind of rate limit that is not
reflected in the physical cores the system is allowed to run on.</p>
<p>In this talk, we propose a new library ""libamicontained"" to offer one place to
consolidate the logic for the answer to this question. We propose a:</p>
<ul>
<li>C ABI exporting</li>
<li>statically linked</li>
<li>zero dependency</li>
</ul>
<p>library which is aware of all of these different runtime configurations and
answers questions about cpu counts etc. in accordingly reasonable ways.</p>
<p>Of course, the real challenge here is adoption. Ideally we can pitch such a
library as ""from the container people"", so it's an easier pitch to language
runtimes. We are here seeking feedback on all points (heuristics to reason
about CPU counts, design goals, etc.) from container people as a first step.</p>

This reduces the overhead of multiple containers, but could have drawbacks with respect to compatibility between processes from different distributions, and security within the application.

The configuration is well-suited for home server applications as it enables the user to efficiently manage media files and execute sysadmin tasks without requiring root access.
In particular, delegating the setup to a playbook that does not require root ensures that the system converges to the desired state without the need for a superuser.
This short talk focuses on a common scenario where a rootless setup may require remapping UIDs and GIDs, which can be quite challenging to maintain over time. Due to the nature of these use cases, Ansible is frequently one of the best options for setting up, updating, and keeping a system up and running over time. 
Finally, this presentation covers other common needs of a container setup, such as the need to store secrets, manage services separated into logical units, and reproduce the setup on different systems.</p>",

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>eBPF stands as a groundbreaking technology enabling the execution of programs                                           <br />
in an isolated space within the kernel of the operating system, operating with                                          <br />
privileged access. This technology proves valuable for safely and efficiently                                           <br />
expanding the kernel's capabilities without necessitating alterations to the                                            <br />
source code or the loading of additional modules. This approach provides direct                                         <br />
access to the Linux kernel space, leading to notable improvements in                                                    <br />
performance.                                                                                                              </p>
<p>A key facilitator in this landscape is <code>bpfd</code>, a system daemon explicitly                                               <br />
designed to streamline the deployment and management of eBPF applications,                                              <br />
falling under the umbrella of Extended Berkeley Packet Filter.                                                            </p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<p><code>bpfd</code> boasts an operator specifically crafted for utilization within                                                   <br />
Kubernetes, allowing users to deploy eBPF programs using a Custom Resource (CR)                                         <br />
 within a Kubernetes cluster.                                                                                                                                                                                        </p>
<h2>Presentation Highlights</h2>
<p>During our discussion, we will delve into the developmental journey of <code>bpfd</code>,                                          <br />
tracing its origins from Aya, a Rust library designed for eBPF development. Our                                         <br />
exploration will extend to practical aspects such as leveraging the operator,                                           <br />

<h2>Security Considerations</h2>
<p>A significant focus will be placed on addressing security concerns pertaining                                           <br />
to pods designated for the execution of eBPF applications within Kubernetes.                                            <br />

<h2>Real-world Adoption</h2>
<p>It's worth noting that eBPF has already been adopted in production environments                                         <br />
by prominent companies, including Google, Netflix, Shopify, and Cloudflare. Join                                        <br />

While the study of scientific instruments has been extensively covered in science and technology studies (STS), as well as aspects related to digital data, software strangely remains absent. I will build on the success of Jupyter computational notebooks to sketch a social study of open source scientific softwares. </p>
<p>The Jupyter project, initiated in 2001 by a physics graduate student interested in scientific programming, has gradually evolved into a global data science infrastructure. I will demonstrate the importance of closely examining its trajectory by identifying the continually negotiated conditions for the transition from local usage to a role as a generic instrument, progressively leading to its integration into a diversity of services beyond scientific communities. The dissemination of computational notebooks has thus not only facilitated a convergence between open code and open science but also between the practices of researchers and those of computer developers, leading to the stabilization of a specific infrastructure for data analysis.</p>",https://fosdem.org/2024/events/attachments/fosdem-2024-3190-from-the-lab-to-jupyter-a-brief-history-of-computational-notebooks-from-a-sts-perspective/slides/22115/fosdem2024_eQ5Upfh.pdf

Even when using local or open-source LLMs in the social sciences and humanities, it is critical to address the inherent inconsistencies of LLM outputs, and to assess their suitability for specific tasks. </p>
<p>How should LLMs be approached and evaluated for digital research projects? I propose a methodology for systematically exploring and evaluating above issues using Prompt Compass. The tool encapsulates research affordances for working with LLMs tailored to the social sciences and humanities. It provides easy access to various local and platformed LLMs, defines default (but modifiable) parameters that produce the most consistent results, offers a library of ready-made and customizable research prompts, allows for looping over rows in a CSV, and allows for testing and evaluating various LLM-prompt combinations. </p>
<p>As technological advances reshape social science and humanities research, tools like Prompt Compass are critical in bridging the gap between LLM technologies and methodological robustness in both qualitative and quantitative research. Such tools allow for a hands-on approach to assess the stability of prompts, their accordance with specific LLMs, and the replicability of research.</p>

And could we do so in a participatory process that uses principles of Data Feminism and Design Justice to diversify who has a seat at the table in the tool development, and whose interest are built into the tools we make? Forged in the fire of such burning questions, we present the UB App as an open-source photovoice application for smartphones, co-created during the Urban Belonging Project (2020-22) in a process that involved scholars from Copenhagen and Amsterdam, professional urban planners, citizen engagement experts, and seven marginalized communities in Copenhagen (deaf, lgbtq+, physically disabled, mentally vulnerable, houseless, internationals, and ethnic minorities). At the 2023 FOSDEM, we are excited introduce the UB App and the UB Toolkit, and use examples from  our design process to discuss the potentials and challenges of involving a multitude of voices and perspectives in the development of digital citizen science tools. We touch upon; how inputs from different stakeholders shaped decisions about what data collection the app makes possible; how it mitigates issues of privacy and visual and spatial literacy to make the app as inclusive as possible; and how design criteria were translated into app features that open new empirical opportunities for community engagement.</p>

Established in June 2019, the society brought together research students from diverse disciplines to foster discussions on transparent and rigorous research methods. Drawing inspiration from the UK Reproducibility Network and various postgraduate-led initiatives nationwide, the society successfully influenced university policy, creating a supportive community for skill-sharing, motivation, and resource exchange. An initially successful project central to the society was the Monthly Mini Hacks. These were workshops that addressed the coding learning curve and promoted collaboration among students and research staff. Using Open Science Framework and open access publishing platforms, we facilitated hands-on coding experiences where information was freely available to everyone.</p>
<p>This talk delves into the story of student collaboration, the highs and lows of open science advocacy, and the valuable lessons learned from the challenges encountered.
The Surrey Reproducibility Society experienced triumph, such as university-wide implementation of policies championed by the society, and failures, including the societies eventual dissolution. This talk reflects on the society’s journey, sharing tools for attendees to implement in their own initiatives, and learn from the success and struggle of our grassroots initiative. We explore the potential for future endeavours, emphasising the importance of adaptability, community engagement, and resilience in advancing the cause of open and reproducible science within the academic landscape. We intend for attendees to leave our talk wiser than we were, inspired to make positive change, and equipped with the tools to do so.</p>",

A typical workshop uses several online components: a website with course notes, an etherpad for shared notes, data downloads, Github repositories and frequently a Jupyter notebook or Rstudio server. One of the popular lessons is HPC Carpentry which covers an introduction to the Unix command line and using shared High Performance Computing systems.</p>
<p>CarpentriesOffline (https://carpentriesoffline.org) is an out of the box solution for running a Carpentries workshop from a single device such as a Raspberry Pi, old laptop or even a dedicated server. It is intended for use in environments where there is limited or no internet access. Everything needed to run the workshop including course notes, data files, software downloads, a Git server, etherpad and a Jupyter Hub server are provided by the CarpentriesOffline system. It can also provide a backup environment for those with better connectivity in the event of the Carpentries website, etherpad, GitHub etc suffering an outage. </p>
<p>We have also developed a miniature high performance computing system based around the Raspberry Pi and RockPi single board computers to allow participants to experience using a high performance computing system without having remote access to one. </p>

<p>At Invest in Open Infrastructure (IOI, https://investinopen.org/), we are committed to iteratively developing Infra Finder with the community. In the past months, through user interviews, focus groups, and testing, we acquired a better understanding of libraries’ and institutions’ infrastructure discovery and evaluation processes. We refined our interface design and data collection and validation workflows to be able to provide up-to-date, validated information in one place, and offer at-a-glance comparison views, with links to more granular information, thereby saving librarians time and effort in looking for scattered pieces of information to discover and evaluate what’s on offer. (More in our latest blog post: https://investinopen.org/blog/blog-introducing-infra-finder/)</p>

An open source repository most often refers to the artifacts recorded in a version control system and occasionally includes interactions around the repository itself. An open source ecosystem refers to a collection of repositories, the community, their interactions, incentives, behavioral norms, and culture. The decentralized nature of open source makes holistic analysis of the ecosystem an arduous task, with communities and identities intersecting in organic and evolving ways. Despite these complexities, the increased scrutiny on software security and supply chains makes it of the utmost importance to take an ecosystem-based approach when performing research about open source. This talk provides guidelines and best practices for research using data collected from open source ecosystems, encouraging research teams to work with communities in respectful ways.</p>",https://fosdem.org/2024/events/attachments/fosdem-2024-2405-best-practices-for-research-in-open-source-ecosystems/slides/22239/FOSDEM_2024_-_Beyond_the_Repository_8ykFkLy.pdf

Despite these initiatives, and potentially due to underutilization by the public and journalists, instances of exploitation endure on Facebook and Instagram. A recent illustration of this is the extensive RRN operation in 2023, involving hundreds of thousands of fake pages and advertisements <a href=""https://www.sgdsn.gouv.fr/files/files/20230719_NP_VIGINUM_RAPPORT-CAMPAGNE-RRN_EN1.pdf"">1</a> <a href=""https://www.reset.tech/documents/24102023_Networks-of-Facebook-Fake-Advertisers_Reset.pdf"">2</a>.</p>
<p>This presentation aims to offer practical insights into navigating the API, highlighting current limitations and proposing effective workarounds. A key focus will be on Facebook’s categorization of “Social Issues, Elections or Politics.” Indeed, applying this label to an ad has two consequences : (1) heightened scrutiny by Meta moderation and (2) increased public accessibility to data such as cost and targeted audience. Deliberate mislabeling then becomes a standard modus operandi in foreign information manipulation and interference.

Drawing from my hands-on experience in my Communication studies master's thesis, ""Visualization of a hypertextual interaction field in the form of a network using computational processes. Case study: Graffiti on freight trains in North America"", this presentation shares the challenges faced by social science students in developing robust programming projects without prior tech expertise.</p>
<p>It underscores the pivotal role of open source tools, and community, in overcoming these challenges, shedding light on the logical links facilitated by adaptable programming projects. This allows the integration between platforms and the possibility of creating logical connections between data and theoretical-methodological aspirations.</p>
<p>The synergy of spaCy, TensorFlow, Instagrapi, Graphology, and SigmaJS exemplifies the potential of open-source software. The presentation explores intricate adjustments made to spaCy, such as hashtag split, term indentification and graffiti entity identification (as writers and crews) without Named Entity Recognition (NER). It also share the application of custom object detection model in TensorFlow. The talk emphasizes the decision-making flexibility within Graphology/SigmaJS for network construction and visualization, with a focus on ""reduction by inference"" as a clear outcome resulting from the amalgamation of theoretical perspectives and different programming libraries or platforms.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the interplay between TensorFlow or spaCy, model inference in Python, the role of SQL as a link between platforms, and network formation with PHP to Graphology syntax, culminating in visualization with SigmaJS in JavaScript, underscores the significance of open-source tools.

<p>Analyses in HEP typically consist of many non-trivially related processes with widely varying requirements. Workflow managers can vastly simplify such analyses, providing user-friendly methods to define, review and run analysis workflows. Snakemake has emerged as a leading workflow manager for HEP, with an established user base spread across major experiments. Dialogue between developers and HEP has led to integrations for distributed storage/transfer frameworks, e.g., <a href=""https://xrootd.slac.stanford.edu"">XRootD</a>, FTP and Amazon S3, and scheduling frameworks, e.g., <a href=""https://htcondor.org"">HTCondor</a>, <a href=""https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html"">Slurm</a>, and <a href=""https://www.drmaa.org"">DRMAA</a>. These integrations enable analysts to better leverage the distributed computing resources made available by experiments, significantly improving the efficiency of HEP analyses. Further collaboration between analysts and developers has seen Snakemake form the core of several standardised analysis frameworks aimed at improving analysis reproducibility such as <a href=""https://reanahub.io"">REANA</a>.</p>

The sensor is designed for a fast-response detection of the atmospheric electric field strength, an intrinsic parameter of the Global Electric Circuit (GEC) that electrically links the Earth’s surface to the upper levels of the atmosphere. Such a field varies greatly with the various weather conditions due to the re-distribution of charged or uncharged aerosols and terrestrial radioactive particles. Field mill electrometers have been consecutively used for ground-based measurements of such fields under diverse conditions, but sparse iterations of the sensor exist that can be tethered to airborne measurement platforms. The lightweight, disposable and easily reproducible design of the MiniMill allows the use on agile platforms, such as weather balloons, UAVs or even campaign aircrafts, and achieves a measurement accuracy of a few V m-1 on DC fields. 
MiniMill performance has been tested in vertical profiling measurements during scientific experiments in 2019 and 2022, where sensor “constellations” were launched on-board meteorological radiosondes under both fair weather conditions and large tropospheric dust events originating from the Sahara Desert. The sensor’s response exhibits a clear influence to the vertical large scale electric field when charged dust particles are present in the atmospheric circulation, which is a significant research achievement.
Also, we would like to share the inherent challenges of such a sensor (or, you know, lots of sensors) implemented entirely within the academic and research community.

<p>This session contrasts, in extreme detail, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and WebAssembly (Wasm), two platforms that have reshaped the landscape of software development. While their basic architecture of a ""virtual machine"" draws parallels, their design, intentions, bytecode formats, and future directions reveal considerable differences.</p>
<p>Differences in Intent and Bytecode Adaptations</p>
<p>We'll examine the underlying intentions behind the creation of the JVM and WebAssembly. While the JVM was initially designed to support the Java language, it has since accommodated other languages like Scala, Groovy, and Kotlin, and has been provided with implementations for dynamic languages like Ruby and Python. WebAssembly, on the other hand, was designed from the outset to support multiple languages, aiming to serve as a compact binary format for the web. We'll analyze how these intentions have influenced the way other languages have been adapted to their respective bytecode formats, by carefully examining the pain points found in JVM and Wasm implementations across the same source languages</p>
<p>Bytecode Differences, Implementation, and Control Flow</p>
<p>Here we will delve into the technical details of each platform's bytecode. While the JVM uses stack-based bytecode, WebAssembly uses a structured stack machine model. The implications of these different approaches will be discussed, with particular attention to aspects like performance, security, and portability. We'll also explore their respective implementations and control flow mechanisms through the use of detailed code examples, as well as high-level expositions.</p>
<p>Standardization Processes, Stakeholders, and Incentives</p>
<p>An important part of this talk will focus on the standardization processes of both the JVM and WebAssembly. While the JVM’s specification is controlled by Oracle, with community input through the Java Community Process (JCP), WebAssembly is an open standard developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). We'll discuss the various stakeholders involved in each process and explore the incentives that drive the evolution of these systems.</p>
<p>The Future of WebAssembly</p>
<p>We'll discuss the future direction of WebAssembly, touching on upcoming proposals such as garbage collection, and the Component Model. Additionally, we'll look at the development of runtimes like Wasmtime, the WebAssembly Micro-Runtime (WAMR), and GraalWasm, and discuss how these work to extend the reach of WebAssembly in new and interesting ways</p>
<p>JVM and the Universal Compilation Target</p>
<p>In our closing discussion, we'll tackle the common assertion that WebAssembly is ""just the JVM again"", and explore why the JVM didn’t quite become the universal compilation target it was often touted years ago. Factors such as the JVM's resource usage, security issues, specific design details have all played a part, and we'll discuss how and what WebAssembly has learned from these challenges.</p>
<p>This session's ultimate goal is to give attendees a detailed understanding of the JVM and WebAssembly, enabling more informed decisions in software development and a clearer perspective on the futures of these two technologies.</p>",https://fosdem.org/2024/events/attachments/fosdem-2024-2769-the-jvm-vs-webassembly-an-in-depth-comparative-analysis/slides/22429/FOSDEM_2024_-_JVM_LvJHXVN.pdf

Linux is slightly falling behind. In this talk, I will cover how IPv6-only and IPv6-mostly networks work and what needs to be done to have first class support in Linux.
Let's talk about IPv6-mostly networks - the kind of networks which run IPv6-only for devices supporting it while providing some IPv4 for devices dependent on it. This can be done by DHCPv4 option called <em><a href=""https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8925.html"">IPv6-only Preferred</a></em>. Using this option, a device can opt-out from IPv4 if it does not need it for proper functionality.</p>
<p>But even if a device opts out from IPv4, chances are it would need some IPv4-as-a-service for supporting legacy applications. Typically, <a href=""https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6877.html"">464XLAT</a> concept is used. This relies on a client-side translator (CLAT) responsible for converting residual IPv4 into IPv6. If such a translator is missing, which is the case for the most Linux desktop distributions nowadays, most things would work normally, but chances are you will hit some corner case where your computer complains about no connectivity.
There are solutions to set up CLAT on Linux but none of them is mature enough. Let's talk about what needs to be done to change this.</p>

It's used to extend the kernel without recompiling it or use modules.
eXpress Data Path (XDP) provides a eBPF-based, high performance, programmable network data path in the Linux kernel.
It provides bare metal packet processing at the lowest point in the software stack, which makes it ideal for speed.
A XDP program returns an action code to tell the kernel what to do with the packet: XDP_PASS, XDP_DROP (and XDP_ABORTED), XDP_TX (and XDP_REDIRECT).</p>
<p>This talk, after a brief introduction of what XDP is, presents how redirecting packets, using the XDP_TX return code, can be used to implement a load balancer.
It shows how using Direct Server Return can increase the throughput and how to use a consistent hashing algorithm to redirect all the packets of a specific connection to the same backend server.
Finally, it explores how the load balancer can be deployed directly to backend servers without the need for a dedicated machine, leveraging the Equal-Cost Multi-Path routing.
The presentation of a possible network topology to deploy this load balancer using BPG or static routes completes the seminar.</p>",https://fosdem.org/2024/events/attachments/fosdem-2024-3101-load-balancing-using-xdp/slides/22124/LoadBalancingUsingXDP_fosdem_I4NPpmE.pdf

<p>This means orchestrated service management with minimal interaction needed from the operator: no more CLI to configure network devices, all OSS and BSS systems synchronised and a flexible service modelling that accommodates the customizations and optimizations needed in a R&amp;E environment. The adoption of a different vendor, NOKIA in our case, poses significant challenges both in terms of low-level mechanics as well as in terms of service modelling and decomposition.    </p>

We are sure that a view into our current progress - especially considering the multi-vendor environment that we manage - will be valuable for anyone involved in the implementation and maintenance of IP networks in the community.</p>
<p>Particular attention will be reserved to the differences between orchestration and automation, how these two topics intersect with each other in managing complex environments and how much the mindset changes in terms of design and implementation process.</p>

GÉANT is contributing to and sustaining it to lower the barrier to adoption so that other organisations can benefit from it and join the initiative. </p>
<p>The other cornerstone of the platform, Ansible, is an open source automation framework with a vibrant community. While not initially created for network devices, Ansible fulfils all our needs and keeps the curve of adoption low. We are eager to share how we used and misused it to achieve our needs in terms of separation between data, design and operations.</p>",https://fosdem.org/2024/events/attachments/fosdem-2024-2306-orchestrating-change-automating-gant-network-migration/slides/22260/FOSDEM_2024_E65wARZ.pdf

For decades, it has provided its own custom scripting language as the primary way for users to handle low-level network protocol events. With the release of Zeek 6.0, support for <a href=""https://community.zeek.org/t/a-first-look-at-zeek-s-new-javascript-support/7188"">JavaScript as an alternative scripting language</a> has been added by embedding Node.js via the <a href=""https://github.com/corelight/zeekjs"">ZeekJS plugin</a>.</p>
<pre>
$ cat hello.js
zeek.on('zeek_init', () => {
  console.log('Hello, Zeek!');
});

$ zeek ./hello.js
Hello, Zeek!
</pre>

<p>This talk will give a short Zeek introduction followed by a technical overview of how JavaScript support in Zeek was realized as an external plugin and demonstrate use-case examples. There will be details about Zeek's plugin architecture, its IO loop concepts and ways to interact with the Zeek script interpreter. Each of these enabled an almost seamless way to load <code>.js</code> script files, adding Node.js's libuv IO loop as another IO source into Zeek's main loop, as well as patching in JavaScript functions as Zeek event and hook handlers. Astonishingly, no modifications to Zeek's core were needed to pull this off.</p>
<p>One area this feature opens up is Zeek interacting with external systems by using Node.js builtin functionality or off-the-shelf libraries through npm - something where the Zeek scripting language ecosystem pales in comparison or quickly requires a C++ implementation. Concrete examples are sending HTTP requests in reaction to certain events, rapid log exporter prototyping (Redis, ZeroMQ), or serving HTTP APIs directly from within Zeek.</p>",https://fosdem.org/2024/events/attachments/fosdem-2024-2388-zeekjs-javascript-support-in-zeek/slides/22308/FOSDEM_2024_ZeekJS_2_EaTnAUL.pdf

<p>k8gb is a Kubernetes native load balancing solution that enables arbitrary workloads to run in a disaster recovery mode as well as in the round robin fashion. It assumes geographically dispersed availability zones aka failure domains.</p>
<p>Luckily, there is another open-source standard that can help with setting up such Kuberneres clusters. Cluster API is a standard that unifies Kubernetes cluster lifecycle and day-2 operations across multiple cloud providers.</p>
<p>In this talk we will be talking about an open-source way to fully automated K8s clusters that can host workloads that can survive any failure, using pure DNS as the underlying tool for switching the communication among available Kubernetes clusters. No single vendor lock-in. Workloads can be deployed in AWS, Azure, GCP, on-prem. The only common denominators are Kubernetes and Cluster-API.</p>
<hr />
<p>k8gb is DNS based global service load balancer that can interconnect multiple Kubernetes clusters into one resilient system. Join this talk to learn how it can handle a failover scenario when pods in one cluster go down and second cluster in different location saves the day.</p>
<p>k8gb is an open-source Kubernetes operator that is deployed in each participating cluster. It is comprised of CoreDNS, ExternalDNS and the k8gb controller itself. Using ExternalDNS it can create a zone delegation on a common cloud DNS server like Route53 or Infoblox so that the embedded CoreDNS servers work as an authoritative DNS. K8gb controller makes sure these CoreDNS servers are updated accordingly based on the readiness probes of the application.</p>
<p>In this sense this solution is unique, because it is using Kubernetes native tools with customisable probes and battle tested DNS protocol instead of HTTP pings or other similar approaches where single point of failure might be a problem. In k8gb architecture all k8s clusters are equal and there is no SPoF except the common edge DNS server.</p>
<h2>Cluster API</h2>
<p>Cluster API is an umbrella standard for multiple cloud providers that can easily create new clusters using Kubernetes patterns such as controllers and custom resources. Together with k8gb it provides very nice synergy to the k8s ecosystem and also enables deploying stuff into those newly created clusters because of its hierarchical nature (parent as a management cluster &amp; child as the workload cluster). </p>
<p>So at the end of day we have two paradigms - k8gb representing the p2p decentralized solution while Cluster API representing the centralized architecture with single management cluster (SPoF). Believe it or not but these two above-mentioned paradigms complete each other and work together in synergy.</p>
<p>Come to this talk and you will learn more about this setup.</p>",https://fosdem.org/2024/events/attachments/fosdem-2024-1793-k8gb-meets-cluster-api/slides/22321/k8gb_meets_Cluster_API_pJ44CHQ.pdf

If you’re a telecom and network jockey you know the problem: Without it, pods only have one interface. When it came to solving this in Kubernetes, rather than tackling the problem, it was left for the ecosystem to solve. Thus, projects like Multus CNI, CNI Genie and DANM came to be: they solved a community problem (“I want more than one interface in my pod!”) outside Kubernetes, following its API extension philosophy.</p>
<p>Fast forward a bunch of years: there’s a new KEP to provide an in-tree solution to multi-networking, which will allow people to express in a Kubernetes native way that their pods require more than one network. </p>
<p>We’re going to look at the problem from two perspectives, first a political one: What’s the community experience with working with the Kubernetes community and what kind of challenges have we faced over the years? We’ll share our stories of successes and, yes, of the failures. But because there’s only so much politics you can stomach, we’ll also look at it from the other end of the spectrum – the hands-on-a-terminal-perspective, looking directly at an implementation.</p>
<p>Together we’ll explore architecture and API changes for Pod interfaces as Kubernetes elements, along with a prototype implementation … in Multus CNI of all things.

<p>But is it, for real, as simple as it sounds? How do you bring declarativeness to the imperative world? In the current state of things, host networking is one huge imperative nightmare. So how to happily marry an old-school Network Manager and brand new Kubernetes API? In this session we will demonstrate how NMState provides you with a Declarative Network API, finally allowing you to manage host networking in a declarative manner.</p>
<p>To make it more entertaining, we will show you how the Kubernetes cluster with NMState Operator manages networking on the nodes it deploys. It may sound like a chicken and egg situation, but trust us, it is not. Last but not least, we show how it protects itself from applying destructive network changes potentially taking your cluster down.</p>

When network packets go missing, its no longer sufficient to capture packets with tcpdump, or trace the path through the Linux firewall rules. You may have to look deeper into the Linux kernel's networking subsystem and trace the packet flow through each of the kernel networking functions watching for packet filtering or modifications. </p>

Vendors enforce their proprietary SDKs or applications, documentation is often limited or missing, sometimes it is even required to sign a contract before getting software access to purchased devices. This locks the user inside a single ecosystem, as switching to a different option would mean rewriting software specific to the device.</p>
<p>enioka Scan is an open-source Android library enabling users to choose the device vendors that really fit their criteria at any given time. It exposes a single API compatible with all supported scanning devices, working on top of a vendor-specific SDKs made open-source whenever possible. The library handles per-device specifics, so the user can focus on the functional aspects of their application. It is also designed to be easily extended with more support for devices not yet compatible.</p>
<p>In this presentation, we will go over the causes of vendor lock-in in the context of barcode scanning devices. After a quick history of the project, we will have an overview of how the library works and how it manages to handle devices from different vendors.

Fast forward to a few hours later, I had assembled an <strong>Arduino-based “artificial nose” that used a gas sensor and AI (so-called TinyML) to learn and detect scents</strong> (hence potentially the smell of a perfectly fermented sourdough starter). As I open-sourced and started to share the project on social media, it went viral… and I felt like an impostor, as most of the code powering it was, frankly, hackish. Or maybe it wasn’t, as it had the merit of having helped me invent something new, in literally a few hours.</p>

* How to leverage Zephyr hardware-abstraction layer.</p>

number of difficulties to overcome had increased so that, in addition to the driver
development, the user space also needed to be patched.

We use distributed systems with nodes in different physical locations to help us tolerate temporary failures such as Internet links going down, as well as hardware failures of our low-cost, second-hand servers.</p>
<p>We built our platform as a set of microservices, taking the form of Docker containers orchestrated by Nomad (a smaller Kubernetes). This allows us to divide our workload in pieces that can be ran on one or many machines simultaneously, and that can in most cases be automatically moved from one geographical region to another in case of failure. This approach works relatively well, however I am frustrated to no end by the idiosyncraties of containers and the Linux/UNIX ecosystem in general which contains huge piles of legacy and is massively getting in our way for building a clean, declarative and resilient dynamic microservice architecture.</p>
<p>I have a dream that one day we can build an orchestrator for microservices that is built on a microkernel, component-based operating system. We just need a way to simply multiplex fundamental resources such as storage and networking (NOT a filesystem, and NOT a full TCP/IP stack with iptables or whatnot), and to schedule and run unikernels or tiny Linux VMs in a cluster of machines. How hard can that be?</p>

This design flexibility empowers users to create minimal and specialized images tailored for individual applications. Despite the advantageous compartmentalization, the process of building a Unikernel remains monolithic. Users must download the Unikernel framework, along with any external dependencies, and engage in a build-from-scratch procedure, even with minimal code changes.</p>
<p>We propose Bunny, a novel build system that aims to simplify the process of building Unikernels. Bunny creates an alternative build process, making full use of the modular aspect of Unikernels. We structure <code>Bunny</code> using a layered approach, where each component represents a distinct layer. Users do not need to build each component from scratch; instead, each respective layer is fetched and can be used to produce the resulting Unikernel image. Moreover, <code>Bunny</code> keeps track of all the dependencies for each component, relieving users from the pain of manually identifying and building all the dependencies.</p>",https://fosdem.org/2024/events/attachments/fosdem-2024-3456-a-modular-approach-to-effortless-and-dependency-aware-unikernel-building/slides/22316/FOSDEM24-bunny_v1_Y1twYme.pdf

These applications are usually deployed on top of a general purpose operating system that provides services like memory allocation, process creation, inter-process communication and networking. The resources like memory or CPU are shared with other processes in the system and with the OS itself. The MPI application competes for host's resources thus limiting its scalability. In this talk, we present the recent effort to build an implementation of the MPI standard on top of the Toro unikernel. In this deployment, we provide a minimalist implementation of the MPI standard as a library that compiles with the application and the kernel thus resulting in a single binary that can be deployed as microVM. Such a library leverages the parallelism that Toro proposes to effectively deploy a MPI application.  Some of the benefits of  using Toro are one instance per core, cooperative scheduler without preemption and local resources. To benchmark our implementation, we port some the OSU Micro-Benchmarks and run them in the Intel Xeon Gold platform. We report the benefits of our architecture when comparing it with existing MPI implementation on Linux.</p>",

<p>This unikernel image is much more lightweight than traditional VM images, which contain a full-blown Linux Distribution. We are talking <em>Mega</em>bytes in size instead of Gigabytes. That's because the unikernel image can be specialized to the application that runs and the environment that the image runs in. Having only one application per VM also allows Hermit to be a <em>single address space operating system</em>. That means we don't have to do any context switches between user space and kernel spaces and every system call becomes a function call into the library operating system.</p>

<p>Do you remember the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Na0qnYO81E"">chair rowing</a>? Do you remember us singing IT songs and directing movies about Java while <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_over_Avian_Carriers"">writing funny RFCs</a>? </p>
<p>Recently, most of the world decided that IT is an elite profession that needs to produce only value no matter what.</p>
<p>This is a great tragedy, and we should rectify it. Why do we have feelings, emotions, and personalities if we no longer have fun?</p>
<p>In this talk, I will take you on a retrospective journey through the years to see what went wrong and how we fix it together. It's more like an art provocation than talk, so please keep your mind open to learn something new.</p>
<p>I will cover the epoch of the world before Agile to the era of the Artificial Immigrant (AI), who is here to take your jobs away.</p>
<p>Last, I will cover how to use your free and open-source skills and attitude to bring more fun to your life.</p>",

<p>Matrix is an open source project defining an open standard for E2EE interoperable communication, and we’ve been following DMA closely.  In the run up to March 2024 we’ve been doing a lot of work to ensure today’s Matrix can help with the immediate interoperability challenges - and also contributing heavily to the IETF More Instant Messaging Interoperability (MIMI) working group to provide IETF-track longer-term interoperability specifically for DMA.</p>
<p>By requiring open APIs (or open standards) for communication, the European Commission is effectively creating an entirely new industry on top of today’s communication platforms - which if executed correctly could supplant the public telephone network with a genuinely open communication fabric for everyone: effectively extending Matrix and/or its derivatives to a multi-billion user network.</p>
<p>In this talk, we’ll explain the work we’ve done with with end-to-end-encryption-preserving Matrix bridges, our contributions to MIMI - and the possibility that Matrix 3.0 (yes, 3.0) might end up evolving into compatibility with MIMI, while adding in the full richness and decentralisation of today’s Matrix.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, since introducing the idea of Matrix 2.0 at FOSDEM 2023 (https://archive.fosdem.org/2023/schedule/event/matrix20/), the Matrix core team has been slogging away along the road to actually shipping it: providing secure, open, decentralised communication which can compete with the mainstream proprietary centralised alternatives.  As ever, the path has had some unexpected twists and turns along the way - and we’d like to share our progress.</p>
<p>We’ll also cover the latest updates on converging on matrix-rust-sdk as the flagship 3rd generation Matrix client SDK (as showcased by Element X and Fractal 5); rolling out instant login, sync &amp; launch via Sliding Sync; transitioning to OpenID Connect for all authentication; implementing full E2EE scalable VoIP and video via MatrixRTC and LiveKit; and major new Matrix reliability projects including trafficlight (full-end-to-end testing of Matrix clients covering both chat and VoIP) and complement-crypto (a full E2EE torture-test suite exercising matrix-rust-sdk and matrix-js-sdk).</p>
<p>Finally, we’ve also been maturing our governance processes: ensuring the Matrix.org Foundation is operationally independent of other companies (e.g. Element) with Josh Simmons joining as the Foundation’s first employee and Managing Director - we’ll cover the work Josh is doing in formalising a Governing Board and getting the Foundation to stand on its own two feet.</p>",https://fosdem.org/2024/events/attachments/fosdem-2024-3345-opening-up-communication-silos-with-matrix-2-0-and-the-eu-digital-markets-act/slides/22568/2024-02-04_FOSDEM_DMA_with_Matrix_2_0_f7oic1B.pdf

This process was due to the perceived cost difference between the legacy on-premise data centers and the newer and shinier public cloud.
Due to a renewed interest in privacy and data sovereignty, many organizations are returning to the on-premise with private clouds.
For the success of such initiatives, it is fundamental to learn from the past and understand how a successful private cloud should be structured.
I started working in 2004 when almost everything was on-premise, and I had a front-row seat to the migrations that occurred in this period thanks to my roles as a Systems and Solutions Architect.
In this talk, we will recap the last twenty years of migrations to learn some key lessons, and then we will analyze what a successful private cloud would look like, which technologies might help, and which could be risky bets.</p>",https://fosdem.org/2024/events/attachments/fosdem-2024-1779-private-clouds-do-not-need-to-be-legacy-/slides/22706/handout_6BEoPXG.pdf

<p>Attestation, generally speaking, is the process of proving some fundamental properties of a system. Attestation plays a central role in asserting that confidential systems are indeed confidential. This technology can be used in a number of ways, notably to implement Confidential Virtual Machines, Confidential Containers and Confidential Clusters. This talk explores the various chains of trust required to preserve confidentiality in each of these use cases. In each scenario, we will describe the root of trust, what is being proven, who verifies the proof, and what a successful verification allows.</p>

It is about the struggles to compete with proprietary software and then having customers asking to transition from their provider forcing them to a 5x more expensive offer. It is about creating a new product CryptPad and running 2 open source communities and our journey providing a privacy protecting software. It is about licenses and the temptation to close some code to be able to be more successful and finally finding other ways. It is about the joys of building Open Source together as a team, how you meet other FOSS people, at FOSDEM, in local communities or in business conferences, and collaborate and share your passion and beliefs. It is about Digital Sovereignty. It's also about what we could have done differently if we knew. It is about how you can live from Open Source, while respecting your contributors, your users , your customers and your employees.
I hope this talk, sharing our experience will help other FOSS lovers be able also to live from Open Source and push them to move to full time Open Source. As for many companies, our story is somewhat a roller coaster with its set of successes and failures.

SCION is a clean-slate, secure and robust Internet architecture, designed to provide route control, failure isolation, and explicit trust information for end-to-end communication. The SCION real-world deployment is rapidly expanding, pushed by several entities that have adopted SCION for their critical use cases. </p>
<p>This talk will be divided into two main parts. Firstly, we will present the latest status of SCION production deployments. One example is the SCION Education, Research and Academic Network (SCIERA) [2]. The SCIERA Network connects via native SCION (i.e., “BGP free”) 12 R&amp;D institutions on 3 different continents (including the National University of Singapore, Princeton University, University of Virginia, among several others). The planned expansion will include several additional institutions, bringing native SCION connectivity to over 500,000 users by mid-2024. </p>
<p>Secondly, we will provide an up-to-date overview of the SCION AWESOME projects [3]. This curated list encompasses projects from various realms, e.g., Path-aware-networking API (in Golang and Java), Python and C/C++ bindings, applications using SCION, SCION network tools, SCION SEED emulator, among many others.  </p>

Sequoia PGP project.  Our goal with Sequoia PGP was not just to
implement OpenPGP in Rust, but to provide a set of privacy and
security tools that are easier to use, and more robust than what was
previously available.</p>
<p>Although OpenPGP is widely considered hard to use, overcomplicated,
and the stuff of nerds, our prior experience working on another
OpenPGP implementation suggested that the OpenPGP standard is actually
pretty good, but the tooling needs improvement.</p>
<p>In this talk, I'll present Sequoia's architecture (library first), our
design philosophy (usable, low-level, unopinionated interfaces, which
are secure by default and are complemented by high-level opinionated
interfaces), and the status of the project (we released 1.0 of our
low-level library in December 2020, and are currently working towards
1.0 releases of our higher-level libraries and services).</p>
<p>Today, Sequoia PGP is used by the RPM package manager, which has
shipped with Fedora since version 38.  Sequoia PGP has been adopted by
SecureDrop, a whistle blowing platform, which is relied by many news
organizations around the world.  And, Switzerland's BioMedIt uses it
as part of their Sett tool, which hospitals and researchers use to
exchange sensitive medical information.</p>",https://fosdem.org/2024/events/attachments/fosdem-2024-3297-sequoia-pgp-rethinking-openpgp-tooling/slides/22731/small_FgtWGSJ.pdf

<p>In an era when data flows seamlessly across diverse decentralized systems and organizations, establishing trust and confidence in the data becomes paramount. Data from IoT devices, distributed applications, and edge servers cross multiple boundaries: trust zones, firewalls, networks, stakeholders, organizations, and geographies. No single entity in such an ecosystem can own the trust.</p>
<p>Project Alvarium is a Linux Foundation (LF) Edge project which aims to build an open-source framework and SDK for creating trust fabrics which deliver data from devices to applications with measurable confidence. Unlike a one-size-fits-all solution, the Alvarium framework empowers communities to construct their unique fabric with preferred technologies, cultivating a rich ecosystem of interoperable trust fabrics.</p>
<p>This presentation explores the transformative potential of a community-owned data confidence fabric (DCF) and trustworthy monetization of data using an open-source distributed ledger, Hedera network, and smart contracts. By embracing open-source principles, our solution not only ensures accessibility, but also encourages a diverse community of contributors to actively participate in refining and expanding the framework. This collaborative approach enhances the solution's robustness and aligns with our commitment to transparency, making the technology more trustworthy and widely adoptable in the broader open-source community. Topics include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Insights from the Alvarium project</li>
<li>Demonstration of a DCF, both its construction and operation</li>
<li>How a decentralized approach to data confidence can empower individuals and organizations, promoting data sovereignty and mitigating risks associated with centralized control</li>
<li>Advantages and contributions the proposed framework offers to the open-source community, ranging from enhanced security and privacy to collaborative innovation</li>
</ul>
<p>Part of the work being presented and demonstrated is based on a joint effort of multiple academic and industrial partners from the European Commission-funded CLEVER consortium. CLEVER is a research project which among other objectives aims to aid the adoption of open access and systematic use of open and standard interfaces. By engaging with the principles of open-source development, this presentation hopes to inspire FOSDEM’24 attendees to envision and actively participate in the creation of a community-owned DCF framework, fortifying the foundation of a more trustworthy and collaborative digital landscape.</p>",

While out-of-the-box 2FA features are helpful, sometimes developers need to customize authentication flows to meet specific business requirements, like registration, credential recovery, or adaptive security to step-up authentication based on risk scores.  All IDPs have some kind of black magic to implement customizations--normally some script or code interface. But at the <a href=""https://jans.io"">Janssen Project</a>, we saw how hard it is to write, maintain and transfer this custom authentication code, and we wanted something more re-usable. So in early 2021, we introduced <a href=""https://docs.jans.io/head/agama/introduction/"">Agama</a>, a low-code programming language to simplify the development of web identity journeys. Agama defines a standard way to build web identity journeys in a potentially vendor-neutral way. It’s both a programming language and a project archive format. In 2023, Gluu launched <a href=""https://agama-lab.gluu.org"">Agama Lab</a>, a free developer tool. Agama Lab takes low code to a new level by enabling developers and architects to graphically white board identity journeys and to release deployable Agama archives directly to a GitHub repository. The Agama Lab Explore Catalog enables developers to fork working projects and adapt them more specific business requirements. Low code may seem silly--yes you can also just write the code. But low code can reduce the time to knowledge-transfer customizations to the next team. And graphical tools faciliate communciation with the non-identity team to help explain the various flows and how they relate.</p>",

Application servers often use OAuth 2.0 protocol flows to identify their users. Identity Providers (IdPs) provide OAuth 2.0 endpoints to applications and pull
over the tasks of authenticating and authorizing users’ access to application resources. They become a central point of interaction between enterprise domains, if those still in use in the organization, and applications. This approach allows to integrate both in-house applications and cloud-based SaaS
applications provided by third parties.</p>
<p>The separation of enterprise IT architecture and an enterprise domain structure, however, leads to a larger issue. While in the past management of the application servers was part of the enterprise domain services (Active Directory, RHEL IdM, …) where regular users and application developers were
present at the same time. Maintaining common access to these servers was easy: since the application server is enrolled into the domain, it can consume domain identities. Not anymore: there is no such guarantee to have both application servers and application developers belonging to the same domain. Effectively, there is a need to access information that is only available in a federated way: through some broker, like IdP. On top of that, the broker might not be able to pass through a certain type of information that might simply not exist on the other side. For example, for Linux servers working together as a compute capacity, it is crucial to have a uniform view on POSIX information about users and groups. But an IdP might simply lack this information because there might be no need for it at the place where a user account is defined.</p>
<p>This talk aims to define a common set of requirements and approaches to represent a secure POSIX identity management integration with OAuth 2.0-based identity providers. Aside from requirements towards client software on the Linux platform, we aim to define possible requirements towards other components of the integration, based on our experience developing Samba, SSSD, and FreeIPA for more than 25 years.</p>",https://fosdem.org/2024/events/attachments/fosdem-2024-2587-posix-identities-out-of-oauth2-identity-providers-how-to-redesign-sssd-and-samba-/slides/22928/FOSDEM_2024_OAUTH2_POSIX_ID_p7qduxd.pdf

<p>This summer, I worked with my mentor Jan Hubicka and Martin Jambor on a project to bypass assemblers when generating LTO object files. Link Time Optimization (LTO) enables GCC to dump its internal representation (GIMPLE) to disk so that a single executable can be optimized as a single module. The current implementation creates an assembly file, and the assembler creates the final LTO object file from the provided binary contents. This project aims to create Link-time-optimization (LTO) object files directly from the compiler to improve compile time performance significantly by bypassing the assembler.

We used it to implement an analysis targeting <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timing_attack#Avoidance"">constant-time vulnerabilities</a>.
Most of the existing tools rely on formal methods and remain barely used (see <a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Marcel-Fourne/publication/361209537_They're_not_that_hard_to_mitigate_What_Cryptographic_Library_Developers_Think_About_Timing_Attacks/links/62a32677416ec50bdb1af307/Theyre-not-that-hard-to-mitigate-What-Cryptographic-Library-Developers-Think-About-Timing-Attacks.pdf"">Jancar et al.</a>).
This study conclude that compiler-based tools are well-received among cryptographic developers.</p>
<p>Our initial tests highlighted that the primary design of the analyzer's inner state machines heavily relies on pointer-related analysis, which leverages alias analysis.
However, it was triggering undesirable side effects in our case.
The needs for our analysis is to also be able to track state for lvalue, alongside rvalue, depending of the target's type.</p>
<p>The subject of this talk is to introduce a practical case where this behavior would allow such analysis to be done, especially since the SA codebase is already heavily prepared for it.
A proof-of-concept to give this ability to the SA has been implemented and aims to be merged after feedback from the community on the idea.
Problems caused by some aspects of C semantics arise and will be interesting to discuss (e.g., the thin frontier between arrays and pointers).</p>

Because, how do you build a modern C/C++ compiler without a C/C++ compiler? To solve this chicken-and-egg problem, an approach taken by some distributions is to rely on opaque, pre-build binaries. However, in order to increase trustworthiness in software, we should be able to produce every part of it from source, or at least reduce the size of the initial binary seed to the absolute minimum.</p>
<p>In the bootstrappable builds movement, the GCC version 4.7 plays an important role: it is the last GCC version that can be built with only a C compiler. Therefore, this compiler is a stepping stone for bootstrapping everything that relies on the C++ language and above. Another important metric for trustworthiness is the capability to build reproducibly, independently of the build directory, which we addressed with patches, as it is not a native feature of this compiler version. Furthermore, additional patches were required for bringing this compiler version up to date, i.e., adding support for more recent C libraries (e.g., the musl libc) and for obtaining a compiler installation that works independently of its install prefix.</p>
<p>We would like to present a build description (for the <em>JustBuild</em> build system), used to patch and bootstrap a GCC version 4.7 on a minimal x86_64 Linux system, which only needs a POSIX shell, coreutils, and a C library (GNU, musl) installed. To achieve this, the bootstrap process starts by building Busybox, GNU Make, and Binutils from scratch before those are used to bootstrap GCC 4.7. We can furthermore show how that compiler can then be used to bootstrap additional build tools (Make, CMake, Python) and even the most recent compilers (GCC 13.2, Clang 17), all from source on the exact same minimal system. In doing so, we basically bootstrap an extremely minimalistic Linux distribution for building compiler toolchains. All of that is strictly defined within a single <em>JustBuild</em> project, which is publicly available under an open-source license at: https://github.com/just-buildsystem/bootstrappable-toolchain.</p>",https://fosdem.org/2024/events/attachments/fosdem-2024-2690-build-distribution-for-maintaining-the-famous-gcc-4-7/slides/22698/FOSDEM24_Maintaining_GCC_4_7_XS2rLLx.pdf

The goal of this work was to help developers create good test coverage for their patch and enable reviewers to verify that they have done so. To accomplish this we have introduced a tool that can be fed a patch as input, add coverage instrumentation for the affected source files, runs Lit tests, and records which test cases cause each counter to be executed. For each counter we then report the test cases executing the counter, but perhaps more importantly we also report the test cases executing the counter that are also changed in some way by the patch, since a modified line that results in zero counter isn’t properly tested, unless it’s intended to be a non-functional change.</p>

<p>How is an SBOM produced? How is it delivered? Does it bundle the artifacts it describes? Can you verify the provenance of the SBOM? These questions lead us to ask whether the SBOM has any real utility as a standalone entity.</p>
<p>In this session, we shall introduce the Open Component Model (OCM, https://ocm.software), an open standard and tooling that supports establishing a secure software supply chain, from producer to consumer. OCM's dedicated tooling packages security and compliance-relevant metadata, such as SBOMs, alongside the software artifacts. It includes support for signing operations, as well as secure transport of artifacts ensuring their integrity and provenance. Our session is ideal for those who find these questions intriguing and are eager to explore possible answers!</p>",https://fosdem.org/2024/events/attachments/fosdem-2024-2939-sbom-what-s-next-/slides/22594/fosdem-2024_SBoM_Whats_next_6M0rQSu.pdf

<p>Out of this effort, the protobom project was born. </p>
<p>Protobom is a project that offers a universal, format-neutral SBOM I/O layer designed to work with SBOM data in a unified way. The project frees developers from caring about the nuisance of ingesting and writing SBOMs. Through a single interface, applications can handle any SBOM format when reading, writing and transforming the data. Protobom is defined in protocol buffers which makes it ideal for storing and transmitting SBOM data. It also means that the project is multilanguage.</p>
<p>On top of the I/O layer, protobom has a rich graph API helping developers query, remix, diff and filter information read from SBOMs. The project is young, but it is already at the core of various supply chain security projects under the OpenSSF umbrella, including SBOMit and OpenVEX.</p>

It is beneficial for developers to adopt SPDX to generate the SBOM for their software. However, with AL and ML taking more and more centre stage in modern applications, how can we make sure SPDX can be useful to AI/ML applications?</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Recently since the bill from the US government has made SBOM the standard in software distributions, all developers have started to think about how they can automate and generate SBOM with all the components stated as required. SPDX is one of the obvious choices for all as its specification is recognized as the international open standard for security.</p>
<p>The stable release of SPDX 2.3 is good enough for most applications. Looking forward, as modern software applications are getting more and more complicated and there are more and more components involved - with the popularity of big data and AI/ML, many applications will involve data and data pipelines. These would need to be considered when generating SBOM in the future. </p>
<p>In this talk, we will look into what has SPDX 2.3 achieved, what is added in SPDX 3.0 for data and AI, and how we can encourage the AI/Ml community to consider SPDX in their applications.</p>
<h2>Goal</h2>
<p>Bring awareness of SBOM and SPDX to the developers and data community. Suggest some strategies in getting more adoption, especially the adoption of SPDX 3.0 to AI/ML communities.</p>
<h2>Target Audiences</h2>
<p>Developers and engineers who work with data. Community leaders who are interested in encouraging the community to build safer software.</p>

One central issue is keeping your documentation, starting from planning and guideline documents, down to requirements, safety analysis, reviews and tests, consistent and up to date. These project artefacts often have their own lifecycle and are natively managed in different tools, with usually great traceability capabilities regarding dependencies between these artefacts as long as you stay within one tool or within a (usually propriety) tool family of one single tool vendor. Currently the resulting traceability gaps between these tools are handled either by the popular engineering tools like MS Excel or methods like “search for identical names”, depending highly on manual maintenance. 
Using SPDX relationships, the upcoming Safety Profile in SPDX 3.1 will provide a model to represent all these dependencies as a knowledge model that can be used both to analyse possible impacts after a change (be it because of a security update or functional variants of your product), provide evidence of completeness and compliance as a Safety SBOM or simply keep track of your product variants.

<p>We'll shed some light on the questions you should ask about your SBOMs, who, and how you can achieve trust at each step of their lifecycle. </p>
<p>We'll dip our toes into the why now, and how we can leverage OpenSource tools and specifications like in-toto attestations, Content Addressable Store, Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts (""salsa""), or Sigstore to have SBOMs that are uniquely identifiable, unforgeable, complete, and available.</p>

This session explores program analysis, particularly reachability analysis, to expose these phantom dependencies and create accurate dependency sets.

Diversity and agility are high values in the Software community. Diversity and agility in Software Development processes and tools are a challenge for automation, though.</p>
<p>Accurate Software Composition Analysis is an important capability to keep transparency throughout the Software Lifecycle and is the base for the fulfillment of important non-functional requirements in the business context (e.g. SBOM-creation, Vulnerability Tracking, License compliance etc.)</p>
<p>To handle automation with both aspects - accurate Software Composition Analysis and heterogeneous and agile environments -  the Abstraction Layer for Software Composition Analysis (ALSCA) of the new Eclipse Foundation Apoapsis Project plays an important role.</p>
<p>The Eclipse Apoapsis-project consolidates the requirements from the tooling side on the one hand and the requirements from the institutionalized operation side in medium to large organizations on the other hand.

Thus, it seems obvious to adopt the same strategy for FOSS compliance material in those areas where the required efforts are identical for all users of the software. With standard formats, such as SPDX, it is possible to share the results of data curation with the community, and thereby reduce the individual effort. The OSSelot project has set itself precisely this task: Creating a publicly available database of curated compliance materials for frequently used FOSS components including SPDX reports for each component. In order to foster usability of the data and external contributions, aspects such as trustworthiness, liability and integration of the data into existing tools must also be considered. </p>
<p>This presentation will demonstrate the stringent curation and review process of the OSSelot data that ensures that all internal and external contributions meet the same high quality standard. It will also exemplify how the OSSelot resources can be used to fulfill FOSS license obligations.

For years, copyleft activists like me have argued vehemently that they are non-functional in addressing the primary license compliance and software security problem that plagues FOSS distributions: an inability to clearly identify, and assure that all in the supply chain receive, the complete, corresponding source for the binaries in question.</p>
<p>Due to the heavy influence and control on SBOM dialogue asserted by proprietary software companies and their business model proponents, proposals to require source code disclosures as a necessary part of the supply chain have typically been rejected.  In short, SBOM focus has been to ease the ingestion of FOSS into proprietary supply chains, rather than assuring that downstream users are afforded the same rights to examination, modification, and reinstallation of FOSS that their upstreams enjoyed.  Most will argue, perhaps correctly, that the ship of universal software freedom has sailed, the industry doesn't want to be on it, so why continue to debate that question in the context of SBOMs and (the mostly proprietary) software supply chains in our world today.</p>
<p>This talk, then, proposes a simple compromise.  Given the non-viability of convincing proprietary software companies that control the supply chains to actually give software rights and freedom to their users and join the Open Source world, what (this talk considers) is a requirement for SBOMs that might improve the situation for downstream users with regard to complete, corresponding source code provisioning, but would not require companies to participate in actual open source releases?</p>
<p>I will propose in this talk a thought experiment of how we might add key information about the supply chain of the source code that produced the binaries into SBOMs without requiring actual source-code disclosure.  While such an addition would be woefully inadequate to assist in compliance with copyleft licenses, it would (a) marginally improve the forensic data available to those trapped at the end of the supply chain desperate to, for example, determine whether they are vulnerable to the latest security bug and (b) provide at least a basic breadcrumbs for those who are testing copyleft compliance of products at the end of the supply chain.</p>",

<p>This presentation aims to shed light on the on the different kinds of barriers a user might encounter in a modern web application (especially in the context of the ""usual suspects"" of content management systems like <a href=""https://wordpress.org"">Wordpress</a> or <a href=""https://typo3.org"">TYPO3</a>), and also show that there are some barriers that all users may encounter, regardless of their physical or mental ability. Instead, some barriers may arise from the technology available to a user (who possibly only has access to a low-end device, works with a spotty network connection or does not have access to a required input device), the education of a user, their language comprehension and many other factors. We will explore key accessibility principles to allow users to overcome these barriers and share real-world practical examples to illustrate the impact of accessible design on user experience and inclusivity.</p>
<p>We will provide actionable strategies for developers and UX designers to enhance accessibility working with or on these CMS frameworks. Attendees will gain insights into optimizing software and content for diverse user needs, ensuring compliance with global accessibility standards and regulatory requirements (like the European Accessibility Act), and leveraging the latest technologies to create a more inclusive digital landscape.</p>",

These environments can be used for interactive data analysis or running pipelines in a CI/CD environment. Environments built with Nix contain R and all the required packages that you need for your project: there are currently more than 80.000 pieces of software available through the Nix package manager, including the entirety of CRAN and Bioconductor packages. The Nix package manager is extremely powerful: it not only handles all the dependencies of any package extremely well, it is also possible with it to reproduce environments containing old releases of software. It is thus possible to build environments that contain R version 4.0.0 (for example) to run an old project originally developed on that version of R.</p>
<p>With Nix, it is essentially possible to replace {renv} and Docker combined. If you need other tools or languages like Python or Julia, this can also be done easily. Nix is available for Linux, macOS and Windows (via WSL2).</p>",

<p>The second launch attempt on October 1, 2022, was a success. PICOBUS flawlessly deployed all the satellites into space, marking a significant achievement for the open-source community. It's a rare instance of open-source technology making it to orbit, which is quite remarkable.</p>
<p>Over the past year, Libre Space Foundation has been working on the second version of PICOBUS. This updated version is a more adaptable and lighter design, incorporating various advanced features and mechanisms to enhance its capabilities.</p>
<p>During this talk, we will discuss all about open source in space, the open source tools used to achieve that and the difficulties faced during this journey.</p>
<p>Our Vision is an Open and Accessible Outer Space for all. We believe that space should be claimed the libre (open source) way.
Our Mission is to promote, advance and develop libre (free and open source) technologies and knowledge for space. To do that we design, develop and deliver space related projects ranging from Ground Station equipment to global monitoring Networks and of course, satellites!</p>",https://fosdem.org/2024/events/attachments/fosdem-2024-2018-a-satellite-s-final-safehouse-the-deployer/slides/22798/Picobus_FOSDEM_2024_Y0SuiCl.pdf

The different machines used in production like printers, pick and place machines, ovens, AOI, testers all run different software, different libraries, different component naming concepts. So to prepare from your KiCad project all programs to run on these machines is really time consuming. Later on the machine jobs changeovers there are also source of machine operator errors.
We are dealing with electronic production for more than 30 years and we are constantly improving our process to avoid stupid mistakes and make the different machine programming easy and predictable process.

Continuous Integration (CI) systems check every software update, testing every part of the software. However, this level of automated testing hasn't been easy for embedded software and devices. The main reason is their <strong>dependence on specific physical hardware</strong>, which traditionally requires manual testing by a person. This manual approach is slow and becomes more challenging as the number of device variants grows.</p>
<p><strong><a href=""https://jumpstarter.dev"">Jumpstarter</a></strong> was created to help with that. It introduces <strong>a way to test embedded software automatically</strong>, just like cloud software. With Jumpstarter, we can test our software on the actual hardware it will run on, but without needing someone to manually handle the device for each test. This is a big step forward because it makes testing faster, more consistent, and less reliant on manual effort. <strong>It fits right into existing CI/CD systems</strong> like <em>GitHub CI</em>, <em>GitLab CI</em>, <em>Jenkins</em>, <em>Tekton</em>, <em>etc..</em>, making it easier for developers to include it in their workflow.</p>
<p>Testing in hardware requires a <strong>testing harness</strong> to connect your hardware to Jumpstarter, as we couldn't find anything readily available and Open; this is why we also created the <a href=""https://jumpstarter.dev/docs/testharness/jumpstarterboard/"">jumpstarter-board</a> that allows power control and metering, storage flashing, console access, and other functions. We are working on the release 2.0.0 with additional functionality and expandability. Additionally, the Jumpstarter software is designed with a <strong>driver architecture</strong> that enables the creation of drivers for additional testing harnesses.</p>
<p>This talk will explain how Jumpstarter makes embedded software testing easier and more efficient. We'll explain how it can save time and ensure better testing results, which is crucial for developing reliable embedded systems.</p>
<p>We will bring the Jumpstarter board with us and share details to let you build your own or get it built for you.</p>",https://fosdem.org/2024/events/attachments/fosdem-2024-3070-jumpstarter-open-hardware-in-the-loop-for-everybody/slides/22835/Jumpstarter_-_Open_Hardware_in_the_Loop_for_eve_ZlGBQwZ.pdf

<p>Short Abstract:</p>
<p>M is a conceptually simple language tightly coupled to a conceptually simple database. Originally developed in the mid to late 1960s, the technology has evolved to stay relevant in the 21st century. The talk reviews the history of the technology, the conceptual simplicity of both the M language and M database, and how the technology survives by evolving to adapt to the changing world of computing. Portability was a goal since its earliest days.</p>
<p>Longer Description:</p>
<p>M first ran on a PDP-7 and was a complete software stack: an operating system, a database, and a language. To run on such limited hardware, M seamlessly coupled a minimalistic database with a minimalistic language. It was based on a small number of concepts.</p>
<p>Fast forward more than a half century. While M is not mainstream software technology, it is the language and database of the largest real-time core-banking and electronic medical record systems. For example, a nation-scale medical record system in Jordan runs a complete FOSS stack developed in M. To robustly and securely serve such large-scale, mission-critical systems that require ""five nines"" availability, M has retained its core principles of a minimalistic language and efficient implementation, which allows it to scale down as well as up: the YottaDB implementation of M delivers thousands of database accesses per second even on a Raspberry Pi Zero with a consumer grade MicroSD card.</p>
<p>To remain relevant with changing economics and technology, M had to evolve. It moved from days when the cost of the hardware dominated, programmers were economical, and software was freely bundled with the hardware, to today. It has done so without compromising its foundational values. It ceased to be an operating system as it was ported to other computing platforms. A production grade implementation was released under a copyleft license in 2000/2001. While the M language retains its conceptual simplicity, the tight coupling of M, the language, with M, the database, now extends to other languages, C, Go, JavaScript, Lua, Perl, PHP, Python, and Rust. The talk will use examples from lua-yottadb, which tightly binds a highly capable minimalistic language and a highly capable minimalistic database.</p>

The focus will not only be concerning direct diffs within a specific commit but emphasizing greater contextualization of what was taking place.
For example, understanding the relationship of a commit in the context of a project's sections; functionality; or symbiotic repos.</p>
<p>Through the use of logic programming (SWI-Prolog) and the useful of (RDF) principles, demonstrations will include:
* How historic changes to files in a VCS should not be treated as logs of affect but additionally as components for adapting other coding and knowledge assets;
* How failure to preemptively describe the desired outcomes from a successful commit mean that there is a failure to provide preparatory automation behaviours.</p>
<p>The aforementioned logic programming and RDF expositions will demonstrate the evolution of the (historically NLNet funded) project Icebreaker.
It shall be mixing its parsing syntaxes from seperate projects (kanban boards and knowledge-management with syntaxes for time series analyses of repos).
There will be a showing of how task management; documentation; and coding intersect using perspectives from how annotations from the ""Recursive-Modelling-Language"" Qiuy intersect over time.</p>
<p>Anybody who has lost an afternoon because of a 1 character mistake in their coding understands the grim insights from the proverb ""For Want of a Nail"".
However, for non coding activities such errors or omittances are more subtle, as the fallout from things tends to be less direct (such as for lost capacity, imprecision or diminished returns).
To return to the proverb, the nail is the instigator of a chain of events, rather than a technical or procedural.
People are unlikely to posit ""For Want of Annealing"" to highlight the pernicious effects of qualified deficiencies.
The consequence of this presentation will be to demonstrate how underutilized qualitative and graph orientated approaches are for modern project management.</p>",

But matrix events which get stored on the homeserver are not suitable for actual real time applications. In this talk we give a brief description of our vision for MatrixRTC which would pave the way for RTC applications such as group calls in your matrix client, a whole collaborative office suite, security/webcam feeds, games, etc. </p>
<p>To realize this vision matrix needs a standardized signaling system for establishing real time (WebRTC) connections between all participants and allow to exchange media and data streams. </p>

However, for historical reasons, TLS for email protocols is often not used directly but negotiated via STARTTLS. This additional negotiation added complexity and was prone to security vulnerabilities such as naive STARTTLS stripping or command injection attacks in the past.</p>
<p>We performed the first structured analysis of STARTTLS in SMTP, POP3, and IMAP and introduced a semi-automatic testing toolkit (EAST) to analyze email clients. We used EAST to analyze 28 email clients and 23 email servers, resulting in over 40 STARTTLS related issues. Only 3 out of 28 clients and 7 out of 23 servers did not show any STARTTLS-specific security issues. We conclude that STARTTLS is error-prone to implement, under-specified in the standards, and should be avoided.</p>",https://fosdem.org/2024/events/attachments/fosdem-2024-2179--protocols-security-of-starttls-in-the-e-mail-context/slides/22526/FOSDEM24_-_STARTTLS_C6COeoF.pdf

It's a stateful protocol that doesn't lend itself to a simple implementation and can be intimidating. IMAP's syntax is branched, subtle, and has various issues. Above that, the syntax is intertwined with business logic, making separating concerns difficult. It doesn't help either that there are more than 70 extensions, with any of them potentially breaking your understanding of how IMAP operates.</p>
<p>In this talk, Simon and Damian recapitulate what they learned about IMAP while implementing/maintaining <a href=""https://github.com/emersion/go-imap"">go-imap</a> and <a href=""https://github.com/duesee/imap-codec"">imap-codec</a>.</p>
<p>After the talk, you will have a much better understanding of IMAP and, hopefully, will avoid making the same mistakes we made.</p>
<h1>About the speaker(s)</h1>
<p>Simon started writing go-imap v1 7 years ago. Of course, misunderstandings happened, and mistakes were made. Thus, he started working on go-imap v2 earlier this year to fix these mistakes and design a better API informed on everything he learned while maintaining this library.</p>
<p>Damian started imap-codec during a STARTTLS research project. imap-codec was born out of frustration. He struggled to construct syntactically valid IMAP messages while analyzing IMAP clients for a specific behavior. imap-codec helped to prevent the same errors from being made twice.</p>",

They need to have a system that lets anyone contact them in a secure and pseudonymous way, without revealing who manages the hotline; they also need to be able to organize their internal workflow securely and safely enroll new members.</p>
<p>We have conducted a user survey among grassroots helplines in Eastern Europe and identified several common traits: first, they rely on a patchwork of tools (messaging apps, cloud storage, task trackers) therefore multiplying potential vulnerabilities; second, they are critical towards popular secure messaging apps that either leak your phone numbers (e.g. Signal), or do not guarantee end-to-end encryption (e.g. Telegram) or may seem tricky to onboard for non-techies (e.g. Element). </p>
<p>What we propose is a chat-mail service using Delta Chat messaging suite, adapted specifically for hotlines and NGOs. Delta Chat is a federated, crossplatform, free and open source messaging app that works over email and offers state of the art end-to-end encryption using Autocrypt and SecureJoin with multiple audits.</p>
<p>During this presentation we will demonstrate how our chat-mail service can help high-risk user groups. We will specifically focus on instant onboarding, shared account management, account portability,  guaranteed end-to-end encryption and embedded collaborative chat-apps (""webxdc"") such as notepads, calendars, task trackers etc. We will also share user stories from the field, since all these features are tested with real hotlines.</p>",

We analysed the vendors' offering for their usability and privacy by measuring the time from zero to certificate as well as their privacy policies. We find that neither of the ten vendors provide a satisfactory offering. We finally sketch a way forward through ACME for S/MIME and present a prototypical implementation for Thunderbird.</p>
<p>We bought certificates from all ten vendors of S/MIME certificates with their CA in Mozilla's Trust Store. For each vendor, we recorded the procurement process and analysed the time and clicks needed, the number of requests and their sizes, and the number of privacy invading third-party requests. Further, we checked on the privacy policies and adjacent documentation to count the number of words and analyse the readability of the necessary documents.</p>
<p>Our results suggest that the market does not provide a satisfactory solution. The vendors either control your secret key, invade your privacy with well-known third-party trackers, or require a PhD to read their privacy policies. Some vendors did not even manage to create a valid certificate.</p>
<p>The best way forward is to establish ACME for S/MIME which allows for a (n)one-click solution. We have created a prototype to show that this is technically feasible.</p>",

Consequently, vendors should incorporate several layers of security to ensure users' individual privacy. A typical solution is to protect data <em>at rest</em> by using encryption. To protect data <em>in use</em>, however, encryption is often considered impractical: encrypting and decrypting data at runtime incurs a significant computational overhead.</p>
<p>As a remedy, there exist Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) that enable database developers to wrap computations in a protected area of the disk. However, the adoption of Open Source software employing TEE to protect data in use is not sufficiently widespread, and such technologies are mostly limited to prototypes. In addition, existing database implementations incorporating TEEs face significant performance issues due to the pitfalls and limitations of Intel SGX, the most commonly used architecture. </p>
<p>In this talk, we present the current state of Open Source secure database implementations using TEEs. We will highlight the strengths and weaknesses of widely-known systems (SGX_SQLite, StealthDB, DuckDB) and discuss design choices developers face when using TEEs to secure data. We provide the results of the most recent benchmarks, which expose bottlenecks and tradeoffs.

Validating these measurements requires a set of trusted reference values. But where do these opaque values come from? Today, they are often provided by a third party, without mechanisms for auditing the trustworthiness or origin of reference values.
We want to make CC offerings auditable, allowing end users to read the source code, reproduce binary artifacts, generate reference values from the artifacts and verify the deployed system (using remote attestation). Every part of the TCB needs to be open source and reproducible.
We will cover the status quo of how reference values are used in CC. We show what the main difficulties and sources of non-determinism are.
Based on a minimal open source example, we explain how we build fully reproducible OS images with mkosi and nix - all the way from source code in Git to the reference values for remote attestation. The presented code is the base for images used in both <a href=""https://github.com/edgelesssys/constellation"">Constellation</a> and the <a href=""https://github.com/confidential-containers/confidential-containers"">Confidential Containers project</a>.</p>",https://fosdem.org/2024/events/attachments/fosdem-2024-1769-reproducible-builds-for-confidential-computing-why-remote-attestation-is-worthless-without-it/slides/22912/20240204-FOSDEM-reproducible-builds-print_lR28MRP.pdf

Ideally, leveraging the added transparency and security guarantees of attestation as an authentication mechanism should be simple. However, the current ecosystem often requires engineers to integrate remote attestation at the application layer of the network stack. This task is not only burdensome, diverting attention from core business logic, but also poses privacy risks. Developers are compelled to navigate a complex maze of security protocols, with the ever-present danger of accidentally exposing sensitive information about the devices running these workloads.</p>
<p>Developing secure and easy-to-use building blocks requires a collaborative effort between the open-source and standards communities. The IETF is working on various specifications, which are being complemented by prototypes and formal verification of innovative features. Several Internet protocols, such as TLS, OAuth, ACME, Netconf, and CSR/EST, are already incorporating attestation, and others will follow. 
A key focus of our work is to integrate privacy-preserving techniques that can mitigate the risks inherent in remote attestation, ensuring that this crucial technology can be utilized in a manner that is both user-friendly and privacy-conscious.</p>
<p>In this presentation, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the current standardization and open-source implementation initiatives. The goal is to make it easier for the broader community to access and engage in this new development, which is crucial for the advancement of the remote attestation infrastructure in general and the utilization of confidential computing in particular.</p>",https://fosdem.org/2024/events/attachments/fosdem-2024-2265-increasing-trust-and-preserving-privacy-advancing-remote-attestation/slides/22934/FOSDEM_2024_Increasing_trust_and_preserving_pri_wbCqaZY.pdf

C and C++ are also susceptible to various defects, such as memory-safety issues, that account for a significant portion of security vulnerabilities in C and C++ software. Addressing the memory-safety challenge has recently received new focus as leading cybersecurity organizations from various countries have  collectively emphasized the significant risks posed by memory-safety issues.</p>
<p>With the ubiquitous use of C and C++ in the embedded device, industrial controls, and IoT space, the chances of removing and replacing C and C++ are virtually nil. To improve software to be more memory-safe, a series of techniques will need to be undertaken to gradually evolve the quality and security of the code:</p>
<ul>
<li>migration to memory-safe alternatives, such as Rust, especially for critical software</li>
<li>easier to use tooling for debugging, diagnostics and application security testing</li>
<li>pro-active vulnerability mitigation and prevention in  software though the use of compiler-based binary hardening mechanisms</li>
</ul>
<p>In November 2023, the Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) published the <a href=""https://best.openssf.org/Compiler-Hardening-Guides/Compiler-Options-Hardening-Guide-for-C-and-C++"">Compiler Options Hardening Guide for C and C++</a> that is focused on helping developers make informed choices regarding compiler options to harden their software against prevalent software defects. Compiler flags are powerful tools that can significantly enhance the security of C and C++ code without requiring expensive refactoring or rewriting in newer, more memory-safe languages. Many such compiler features are also useful for discovering memory safety issues during debugging and testing.</p>
<p>In this talk, Thomas will give an introduction to the OpenSSF Compiler Options Hardening Guide for C and C++. He will talk about how the guide came into existence in the OpenSSF, its current structure and future extensions. This talk particularly intends to actively invite feedback and call for collaboration.</p>",https://fosdem.org/2024/events/attachments/fosdem-2024-3468-compiler-options-hardening-for-c-and-c-/slides/22562/Slides_3vYNJqd.pdf

The Trusted Postgres Architect (TPA) attempts to change that by helping to deploy Postgres architectures with infrastructure as code.</p>
<p>TPA is an open source orchestration tool that uses Ansible to deploy Postgres clusters according to our best practices. These recommendations are as applicable to quick testbed setups as to production environments. We will see how TPA can deploy PostgreSQL to bare metal, AWS and docker containers, using different replication manager tools such as repmgr and Patroni, and backup and recovery solutions such as Barman.</p>
<p>TPA has been released as open source this year, and it accumulates several years of experience from our engagements with customers, therefore, it is nowadays being used in production by several projects.</p>

<p>What's going to happen next?</p>
<p>The EU Commission will issue a standardization request to European standardization organizations to develop multiple technical standards (about 40!) defining how to apply the requirements of the CRA. As usual, the devil is in the details, and these standards will substantially shape the future of software in Europe, and as a result, of open source.</p>
<p>The problem?</p>
<p>The EU standardization organizations which will be tasked with developing those standards (CEN-CENELEC and ETSI) are very formal structures that are as arcane and antithetical to open source communities as the EU legislative process itself was only a few months ago.</p>
<p>There's a very serious risk that this upcoming standardization process might happen again with little or no consultation of the impacted open source communities and lead to additional harm as a result, further damaging Europe’s standing in the open source community and its ability to host, foster, contribute to, and leverage open source projects essential to its sovereignty.</p>
<p>The goal of this session is to preempt this scenario by proactively engaging with policy makers and carving out a path forward that leads to better outcomes for both Europe and open source.</p>",https://fosdem.org/2024/events/attachments/fosdem-2024-3395-cra-40-new-ways-the-cra-can-accidentally-harm-open-source/slides/22535/tobie-langel-cra-standards_kD5xb6s.pdf

On the one hand, some projects would like to know as much as possible about their users so they can focus their development efforts where they would be the most effective.  On the other hand users are rightly reluctant to give up what is their private data.  Data can range from configurations and use of features to performance.</p>
<p>Numerous projects have tried, some more successfully than others.  The <a href=""https://www.linuxfoundation.org/legal/telemetry-data-policy"">Linux Foundation's Telemetry and Data Collection Policy</a> provides one example of a framework for projects to operate within.  A recent example of the tensions can be seen in the <a href=""https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/f40-change-request-privacy-preserving-telemetry-for-fedora-workstation-system-wide/85320"">discussions</a> following a proposal to introduce telemetry into the Fedora Desktop.</p>
<p>Meanwhile various sophisticated techniques are being developed that try to square the circle of obtaining detailed telemetry while simultaneously preserving privacy and making it hard for people to deliberately skew the data.  One example is the IETF's <a href=""https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-ppm-dap/"">Distributed Aggregation Protocol</a> and another is Google's <a href=""https://research.google/pubs/rappor-randomized-aggregatable-privacy-preserving-ordinal-response/"">RAPPOR</a>.</p>

<p>This presentation will talk about how SoCs can leverage Binman to simplify the overall boot-loader build flow. We use Texas Instruments (TI) K3 family of SoCs as an example, which, like many other SoCs today, use custom tools to build and sign their boot-loader binaries. However, U-Boot contains a powerful and flexible packaging tool Binman and this can be extended to sign and package even complex boot-loader images.</p>
<p>The session outlines the challenges in maintaining and shipping custom tools for any sort of build, highlighting its limitations in scaling, maintaining consistency and accommodating evolving system requirements. This presentation shows the effort in leveraging Binman, moving towards a completely open-source solution that also simplifies the build using K3 devices as an example. We also aim to present how we can make Binman the standard when it comes to the developing boot-loaders for any OS. A few platforms such as Kontron i.MX8M and Renesas RZ/N1 already use Binman to package their boot-loader binaries but we see that there is a larger scope of pulling all platform packaging to the standard.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>The boot loader images involved in booting a TI K3 device to Linux are:
- tiboot3.bin: containing SPL (Secondary Program Loader) for the R5 core, may include system firmware for certain devices
- sysfw.itb: containing system firmware and board configuration binaries
- u-boot.img: containing the U-Boot image that can load the final Linux kernel image</p>
<p>In addition to the complexity of the <a href=""https://u-boot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/board/ti/k3.html#boot-flow-overview"">K3 boot flow</a>, each boot-loader image is packaged differently according to the whether the device:
- is a High-Security Field Securable (HS-FS), High-Security Enforced (HS-SE) or General Purpose (GP)
- follows Combined or Legacy boot flow
- contains system firmware (SYSFW) split into Texas Instruments Foundational Security (TIFS) and Device Manager (DM) or not split</p>
<p>This leads to four similar yet unique <a href=""https://u-boot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/board/ti/k3.html#boot-flow-variations"">boot flows</a>. Since the image must account for a combination of the three choices, packaging the boot-loader is a complex process that involves signing as well.</p>
<p>This was earlier achieved using TI custom solution repositories, k3-image-gen and core-secdev-k3. k3-image-gen was responsible for generating and packaging board configuration data and system firmware binaries into tiboot3.bin or sysfw.itb while core-secdev-k3 was used for signing the required binaries in the case of HS devices. The flow looked like <a href=""https://github.com/nehamalcom/migration-binman/blob/main/boot-flow-before-binman.drawio.png"">this</a>.</p>
<p>The upstreaming effort proposed a flow that embedded the functionalities of k3-image-gen and core-secdev-k3 using Binman shown <a href=""https://github.com/nehamalcom/migration-binman/blob/main/boot-flow-after-binman.drawio.png"">here</a>.</p>
<p>Now by migrating the boot-loader generation to Binman, complex shell scripts that stitched boot images together are no longer needed. Instead, the generation is standardized to creation using the binman node in the DTS, for example:
<code>tiboot3 {
    filename = ""tiboot3.bin"";
    ti-secure-rom {
        content = &lt;&amp;u_boot_spl&gt;, &lt;fw1&gt;, &lt;fw2&gt; ...;
        keyfile = ""key.pem"";
        load = &lt;LOAD_ADDR&gt;;
        load-fw1 = &lt;LOAD_ADDR_FW1&gt;;
        load-fw2 = &lt;LOAD_ADDR_FW2&gt;;
        ...
    };
    u_boot_spl: u-boot-spl {
    };
    fw1: fw1 {
        filename = fw1.bin;
    };
    fw2: fw2 {
        filename = fw2.bin;
    };
    ...
};</code>
An example of a proper application of the Binman node for K3 devices can be seen <a href=""https://source.denx.de/u-boot/u-boot/-/blob/master/arch/arm/dts/k3-j721e-binman.dtsi"">here</a>.

<p>This presentation will provide an overview of the tool, understanding how to migrate your custom tools and platforms to Binman with K3 as an example and finally discuss current challenges and limitations while expanding to other platforms in U-Boot. Attendees will obtain insights into a practical implementation of Binman, its integration within existing workflows and best practices to leverage this tool to optimize U-Boot boot-loader development.</p>",https://fosdem.org/2024/events/attachments/fosdem-2024-3067-standardizing-the-generation-and-signing-of-boot-images/slides/22808/FOSDEM24_Speaker_Slides_y7FsIKM.pdf

Open source is integral to software development, and AI models are no exception. The open source community, leveraging its collaborative model, has significantly contributed to the AI ecosystem. This includes the development of frameworks used to build models, standards, or the sharing of datasets that train these models. Such contributions have enabled the creation of both open source and proprietary AI models, as evidenced by organizations like OpenAI, Hugging Face, and NVIDIA.</p>

And here we do not only have Snaps of desktop applications, but also system applications and components (like the printing stack), the kernel, the desktop environment (like GNOME or KDE), the boot loader, and the core system. So everything can get easily updated or replaced by alternatives, and in case of failure one can easily revert (on boot failure we revert automatically).</p>
<p>All this is based on the knowledge and experience we gained at Canonical when creating the smartphone operating system <a href=""https://ubports.com/"">Ubuntu Touch</a>.

This presentation will offer an in-depth overview of the journey we've undertaken in building Netdata, highlighting the challenges we've faced and the innovative solutions we've developed to address them.</p>
<p>In this presentation, we will delve into the history of Netdata, starting from its inception. We'll discuss the initial goals of creating a monitoring tool that could offer high-resolution metrics, auto-detection of metrics, and real-time visualization, all with minimal configuration required. We'll also explore how Netdata garnered rapid attention and support from the open-source community.</p>

<ul>
<li>a very efficient database engine (Netdata vs Prometheus: 35% less cpu utilization, 49% less memory, 12% less bandwidth, 98% less disk I/O, and 75% less size on disk for the same dataset),</li>
<li>a powerful alerting engine that uses statistical analysis, machine learning and templates for fully automated alerts</li>
<li>a streaming protocol supporting streaming of live data, replication of metrics, and support for routing interactive queries between Netdata agents</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, we'll discuss Netdata's transition into a distributed monitoring solution and the decision to seek funding to build a sustainable company around the open-source project. We'll emphasize the core concept of the Netdata SaaS model, which keeps monitoring features open-source while offering additional benefits like better integration, RBAC, and support through the SaaS platform.</p>
<p>The presentation will showcase how Netdata's architecture allows for distributed monitoring, vertical and horizontal scalability, and real-time visibility across infrastructure. We'll discuss the challenges faced and overcome, such as the creation of a custom database engine, the streaming protocol as a fundamental element of the distributed nature of Netdata, the introduction of unsupervised anomaly detection, the implementation of distributed queries, the need for clarity and transparency during visualization and the user interface concepts we used to avoid providing a query editor to users.</p>

<p>This talk will give an overview of the new and improved narrowband doppler drifting search pipeline created for the Breakthrough Listen project which searches for signs of extraterrestrial intelligence using radio telescopes. The new pipeline called BLISS (Breakthrough Listen Interesting Signal Search) includes a new C++-based device-aware ndarray library called BLAND (Breakthrough Listen Arrays with N-Dimensions) heavily utilizing dlpack for easy interaction with a large ecosystem of neighboring scientific computing tools used in software radio such as numpy, cupy, matplotlib, pytorch, tensorflow. We will show how this library works with a quick overview of ""why ndarrays"" and build on top of that to work through the whole pipeline from 100m dish to detected signals.</p>
<p>The current pipelines process hundreds of MHz of instantaneous bandwidth which is channelized in to various data products including down to channels of single-digit Hz. These fine channels are then used to search for narrowband doppler drifting signals. This search is sorting through the galactic haystack for needles which don't originate from earth. We'll highlight how we mitigate radio frequency interference, algorithmically search for signals with both single dish &amp; arrays, what's new &amp; corrected in the updated pipeline from historic SETI pipelines, and ways to join the SETI open source community.</p>

<p>In the evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, we're witnessing a significant shift in deep-learning design patterns, particularly with the advancement of foundational models. A key innovation in this area is the concept of 'adapters' –  small yet powerful add-ons that enhance an existing neural network with new capabilities without retraining its core layers.</p>
<p>However, this innovation brings a hefty software engineering challenge, mainly when we discuss creating an open-source library encompassing a diverse range of these adapters. Neural networks, by their nature, are built using frameworks that procedurally encode their operations. Every time a new adapter is introduced, it often requires a substantial rewrite or rethinking of the existing code base.</p>
<p>To address this challenge, we've developed 'Refiners' – a streamlined micro-framework built on top of PyTorch, one of the most popular machine learning frameworks. The goal of Refiners is to serve as a comprehensive collection of foundational models and their respective adapters. Its primary design pattern sets it apart: envisioning all neural networks as a 'Chain' of primary layers, neatly nested one after the other. Furthermore, we've integrated the 'Context API,' a feature that allows the implementation of complex models, including those that don't follow a simple linear structure.
By doing so, Refiners simplifies the integration of new adapters, making it easier for developers to build and enhance neural networks without the need to overhaul their entire code base each time. This approach saves time and opens up new possibilities for innovation in AI development.</p>",https://fosdem.org/2024/events/attachments/fosdem-2024-1821-introducing-refiners-a-micro-framework-for-seamless-integration-of-adapters-in-neural-networks/slides/22685/Refiners-FOSDEM-2024-talk_compressed_CSYxuqF.pdf

AI adoption has more than doubled since 2017 and companies are now promoting an AI first strategy with their products and services. But if a developer wants to consume AI in their applications, do they need to be an AI expert? The simple answer is No!</p>
<p>In this talk application developers will learn how they can treat AI the same as any other ""function"" where they give it input and it returns the expected output. This is made possible by open source AI frameworks that enable users to manage models through a set of developer friendly APIs. Discussion will revolve around open source frameworks like Ray, TGIS, Triton and TorchServe, to give an understanding of the tools available to help on the AI journey. There will be a demo of one of these runtimes in action by loading open source models from Hugging Face from different domains and querying the models through a web UI. </p>
<p>There are great open source tools out there that provide an abstraction layer for application developers where they can consume AI models through APIs independent of understanding the data form of the model.

For society an immanent danger is also in how easily they can be poisoned or lobotomized to propagate disinformation. It is also difficult to uncover and address sources of bias. The later is of particular legislative concern—see emerging regulations such as the EU’s AI Act as a prototype for whats to come. Without traceability for data with clear license expressions and provenance, AI models are easy targets. The open source community are particularly vulnerable and defenseless. Without a preemptive strategy legal risks are untenable. We expect an avalanche of litigation in response to AI driven disruption of the business of established information providers and creatives.

While social issues give rise to policy solutions and thus legislations, ethics are deeply rooted in societal values that differ greatly from one jurisdiction to another. In the last decade, diverse groups and individuals have departed from using exclusively Free Software licenses on their projects to developing new types of licensing solutions which prioritize “ethical” restrictions on how software should be further used and distributed. In this talk, I will delve into the ethical dimensions of the convergence of AI and Free Software, examining the challenges and opportunities in building responsible and ethical AI solutions within the free software ecosystem.</p>
<p>This talk firstly provides examples of some of the most common licensing models imposing “ethical” restrictions. It then examines how licensing models imposing additional behavior restrictions that supposedly call themselves “open” are in contravention of the definitions of Free Software and Open Source Software. We will further explore some predominant material harms emanating from the use of these restrictive licenses. Lastly, given the various technical &amp; legal obstacles in using these restrictive licenses, I implore that the ethical compliance checks must fall within the purview of regulations and not software licenses.</p>
<p>Given the proliferation of ethical licenses in AI landscapes causing additional behavior restrictions, integration of Free Software, license compatibility and licensing compliance become more complex, affecting the whole ecosystem.

Regularly, 1 hour of footage takes 6 hours' editing just to remove space, filling words, mumbles.</p>
<p>After that, I am exhausted and couldn't do any creative arrangement.</p>
<p>It's nearly impossible to select quotes from different speaker in different time and combine into 1 package as a independent creator in spear time, without a team.</p>
<p>I'll share my effort to take back control of video creating, editing, and note-taking, with or without Vim. </p>
<p>During the last two years, I wrote myself a series of handy scripts. It works with or without Vim. I cut my podcast with it, and translated podcasts into captioned videos. It's highly efficient.</p>
<p>Yes, there are commercial products like Descript, Adobe Podcast, AVID Media Composer on the market. But it's not open nor free.</p>
<p>Basically I defined a file format. It's basically a spreadsheet in plain text, tsv. It can be converted to and back from srt subtitle.  After that, you can remove it, shuffle it, combine it or repeat it.</p>
<pre>
EDL 00:00:03,123 00:01:03,500 | clipname | subtitles, maybe description with AI 
</pre>

<p>To prove the simplicity, one can convert srt to tsv in a single line of bash:</p>
<pre>
cat some.srt | sed -n -r '1{/^$/n;};/^[0-9]+$/{n; s/ --> /\t/; s/$/\t| _CLIPNAME_ |\t/; N; s/\n//; h; d;}; /^$/! { H; $!d;}; x; s/\n/\\N/g; s/^/EDL\t/;p' > some.tsv
</pre>

<p>EDL stands for 'editorial decision list'. Those three letters are very useful with 'grep'. Yes. You can grep it! For example, the following line invokes ffmpeg and generates a video.</p>
<pre>
cat recording_1990.tsv recording_2023.tsv | grep -c 3 Linux | tsv2roughcut
</pre>

<p>Each line without 'EDL' in the beginning, will be ignored. So you get comments now. The clipname can be audio, video or still picture.</p>
<p>You may also pipe it into tsv2fcpxml, and import into professional editing software for fine-tuning, or delegate to professional editors. So you don't have to work late side by side with them.</p>
<p>You may even add B-roll at the head of the subtitle, to create a BBC style voice over video. </p>
<p>Furthermore, with this plugin in Vim, you can preview video/audio with mpv player, cut/join lines, add comments and fold/unfold with Markdown/Org mode style headers.</p>
<p>(This methodology originated from BBC is called 'Paper edit'. It's battlefield proven since 1970s and can be very efficient in news-making or news-faking.)</p>

For instance, to write a library able to behave like a network stack (e.g. lwip and picoTCP) or a device, it's possible to implement functions like my_socket, my_accept, my_open and my_ioctl, as drop-in replacement of the system call counterparts.
Additionally, it's possible to use dynamic library magic to rename/divert the system call requests to use their virtual implementation provided by the library.
Unfortunately this approach cannot be applied to poll/select system calls because Linux doesn't have a system call that permits to generate synthetic generic events for a file descriptor, so it is not possible for libraries to provide file descriptors suitable for select/poll system calls.</p>
<p><a href=""https://github.com/rd235/libvpoll-eventfd"">libvpoll</a> permits to define file descriptors whose I/O events can be generated at user level.
This permits to generate synthetic events for poll, select, ppoll, pselect, epoll, etc.
The libvpoll library can use two different supports: a module that provides a virtual device and a kernel patch extending the eventfd system call.
When neither are availables, a feature-limited emulation is provided as a fallback: based on pipe it manages only POLLIN and POLLOUT.
This approach allows mixing real file descriptors with others provided by libraries as parameters of poll/select system calls.
For example libvpoll has been used in <a href=""https://github.com/virtualsquare/picoxnet"">picoxnet</a>, a user-level network stack implemented as a library for the <a href=""https://wiki.virtualsquare.org/#/tutorials/ioth"">Internet of Threads</a>.

The big upcoming change is adding encryption and HMAC security to all TPM transactions because of the threats from Interposers (hardware corrupted to snoop the TPM bus).  This will be completely transparent to users, but infrastructure can be added to detect interposer compromises.  This talk will outline how this works and the null seed scheme for detecting interposers.</p>

Applications can securely store and share credentials, secrets and cryptographic keys, sign and encrypt data, negotiate a common encryption key - all this by never touching a single byte of the underlying cryptographic material.</p>
<p>This is especially useful in the post-heartbleed and cloud-native environments, where services authenticate and securely talk to each other using some kind of credentials. But if a network-facing service also has some secret in its process address space, it sets itself up for a security failure as any potential out-of-bounds memory access vulnerability may allow the secret to be leaked. Imagine a world where you don’t have to run an SSH agent just to protect your SSH keys.</p>
<p>On top of keeping your secrets secret Linux keystore nicely integrates with specialized security hardware, like TPMs and HSMs and may provide a single entry point on the system for applications to obtain their secrets. Thus Linux keystore is a very useful building block for a corporate key management system.</p>",https://fosdem.org/2024/events/attachments/fosdem-2024-3371-what-is-linux-kernel-keystore-and-why-you-should-use-it-in-your-next-application/slides/22841/keystore_VOjPH5I.pdf

This task spans a lot of different abstractions in the IT ecosystem, from network protocols, to filesystems, encryption algorithms etc. One very active topic of research is the reverse engineering of low level firmware. This topic proves to be quite a bit more difficult than a lot of others on the list.</p>
<p>One of the big challenges in the reverse engineering of low-level firmware is the lack of hardware abstractions and known interfaces (e.g. syscall interfaces and libraries with known exported functions). Furthermore, this type of firmware is oftentimes found in on-die ROM, which provides a good incentive to keep it's size small, as this type of memory can be expensive. This usually means there is not a lot of space for (debug) strings either. </p>
<p>These factors making static reverse engineering quite a tough challenge, which in turn makes dynamic reversing more attractive. However, this is not an easy task. The lack of hardware abstractions and the presence of memory-mapped peripherals makes emulation no small feat. Outside of some OSINT and cross-referencing, the best one can do is guess at the working of some of these unknown peripherals. But is there a smarter way of guessing? </p>
<p>In this talk, we present <a href=""https://github.com/NetherlandsForensicInstitute/CONFEDSS"">CONFEDSS</a>, a project for <strong>C</strong>oncolic <strong>F</strong>irmware <strong>E</strong>mulation using <strong>D</strong>ynamic <strong>S</strong>tate <strong>S</strong>election. This project aims to make it easier for reverse engineers to dynamically reverse low-level firmware by emulating it and using dynamic state selection as an approach to peripheral simulation. We will give a detailed insight into the problems usually encountered with low-level emulation and show it's workings with a live demo, which will hopefully inspire you to use it the next time you want to emulate some BIOS logic for exotic hardware or find where that weird driver quirk comes from.</p>",https://fosdem.org/2024/events/attachments/fosdem-2024-2247-confedss-concolic-execution-and-the-puzzling-practice-of-peripheral-emulation/slides/22639/CONFEDSS_FOSDEM_2024_WE4dDGn.pptx

I'll cover what Arm64EC is, postulate on why it is the way it is, and lessons learnt from porting LuaJIT to it.
What if there was a CPU (and associated C toolchain) capable of executing both x86_64 and arm64 instructions, cheaply switching back and forth at any function call boundary? While there isn't such a thing, Arm64EC emulates such a CPU - any x86_64 code is emulated, and any arm64 code needs to contort itself slightly to allow cheap switching in to and out of the emulator. The result is something of an emulation Frankenstein, but <em>just maybe</em> it'll help adoption of Windows on arm64.</p>
<p>Speaking about a Windows feature at an open source event might seem initially odd, but things can be intellectually interesting regardless of origin, and open source tooling such as Wine and LLVM have started to add some support for it, and open source developers might want to port their applications to it (as I have done for LuaJIT).</p>

It featured a 6502 CPU running at 2 MHz and up to 256 kB memory. But its most interesting feature was a second CPU interface, which (much like Acorn's Tube) allowed to attach various CPUs to the system.</p>
<p>Commodore designed two cards: Z80 (for running CP/M) and 8088 (for running MS-DOS). Back in these days, though, MS-DOS had a separate version for each platform. Therefore you could only run specially crafted Commodore MS-DOS 1.25 on the computer, because it was obviously not PC-compatible.</p>
<p>A few years ago I set out to fix this deficiency. I asked myself: is it possible to make the platform (more) PC compatible? As it turns out, it is, and practically without any modifications to the original design. You just need to write a piece of software that emulates the PC BIOS and some parts of the PC hardware platform. For this, one wire needs to be added to the hardware, which generates a NMI when an I/O chip is accessed; the emulation software then simulates the non-existing I/O peripheral.</p>
<p>Based on this work, I was able to make the platform compatible enough to run modern FreeDOS, as well as other PC software: Norton Commander, Turbo Pascal, QBASIC and more.</p>
<p>As a follow-up, I designed a Z8000 processor card using the second CPU interface; this card is meant to emulate the abandoned Commodore 900 Unix workstation. This is a work in progress right now; so far the card is able to boot the Commodore 900 BIOS and complete the I/O chip self test (the I/O chips are obviously also emulated in software). By the time of the talk, the progress is expected to be much farther :)</p>

Commodore64 and BBC Micro are in the TODO list.
What makes more fun is that you dont have to just copy what was done, but you can make your own unique arhchitecture as well, with the flexibility Neo6502 presents you can make your own dream 6502 computer.

CrateDB as an open-source distributed SQL database helps to streamline data management by supporting a wide variety of data models ranging from documents over time series and full-text search towards recently added support for vectors and similarity search. Thus, it helps to avoid technology sprawl in modern data architectures that need to cope with structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data while not sacrificing the convenience of having a standard SQL interface. LangChain, an open-source framework written in Python, is specifically designed to facilitate the development of applications using large language models (LLMs). LangChain enables seamless integration of language models with various data sources and services, acting as a bridge between AI language capabilities and private data.</p>
<p>During the talk we will demonstrate CrateDB's proficiency in storing and handling vector data, and how this can be utilized by large language models (LLMs) through LangChain, further enhanced by RAG for richer contextual insights. Through live coding demonstration, we will illustrate firsthand the process of extracting data from CrateDB and integrating it into LLMs using LangChain, thereby enriching language models with new data. This integration finds practical applications in semantic search, content recommendation, and data analytics, just to name a few.</p>
<p>The talk will appeal to anyone keen on leveraging Large Language Models, enhanced by Retrieval Augmented Generation, to unlock new insights from their private data. Participants will also learn how to leverage the CrateDB database to efficiently store vector data and utilize vector search in advanced analytics applications.</p>",https://fosdem.org/2024/events/attachments/fosdem-2024-2112-how-to-use-private-data-in-generative-ai-end-to-end-solution-for-retrieval-augmented-generation-with-cratedb-and-langchain/slides/22520/FOSDEM2024-CrateDB-LangChain-Selakovic-Kurze_FkF8YmI.pdf

Unlike most of other probability toolkits, it is open to different probability representations, including fractions and symbols (using the <a href=""https://www.sympy.org"">SymPy library</a>). These features make Lea ideal for education, to learn the theory of probability, from basics to advanced concepts.</p>
<p>The talk will present classical or non-classical problems in probability, and how these can be solved easily using Python and Lea. These include games (dice roll, RPG combats, etc.) and funny paradoxes (non-transitive dice, boy or girl paradox, etc.). The “murder party” case will demonstrate how uncertain information can help to find out the most probable perpetrator of a murder.

In addition to that, the UI framework we had been using got out of support.

Therefore, the team faced the challenge to integrate pages with the old frontend together with new pages in the new single page application.

<ul>
<li>Why we need to understand our tests (and why code coverage is not sufficient)</li>
<li>What mutation testing is (with practical examples)</li>
<li>How mutation testing got to practical applicability (from infeasible at inception to good framework availability to start using it in your projects now)</li>
<li>State-of-the-art improvements to make mutation testing even more awesome</li>
</ul>

As it is impossible to have more than a single init system running as PID 1 on a machine, testing an init system is only feasible by using external testing hardware or virtual machines. In this talk we'll go over systemd's existing integration test suite, how it works, and our current project to migrate the integration test suite to run in virtual machine images produced by mkosi, systemd's image builder sister project.</p>
<p>We'll also discuss many of the features systemd and mkosi provide that make running integration tests in virtual machines a breeze. This includes but is not limited to communicating the exit status of an integration test to the host system once the integration test finishes, automatically running the integration test once the virtual machine has booted, using ephemeral instances of the same image for each individual test to make it trivial to run tests in parallel, automatically tunneling test logs out of the virtual machine and more.</p>

The SLSA standard gives good guidance on levels of maturity, but the tooling has been slower to follow.</p>
<p>In this talk, we'll show how to leverage Chalk to both capture build provenance and do build attestation with Sigstore, in a way that you can deploy to entire build systems transparently without needing to change most build pipelines.</p>",https://fosdem.org/2024/events/attachments/fosdem-2024-2877-making-it-easy-to-get-to-slsa-level-2/slides/22891/chalk_slides_o8QV4hC.pdf

A Case Study of 262 Java Projects on Github,fosdem-2024-3029-are-project-tests-enough-for-automated-dependency-updates-a-case-study-of-262-java-projects-on-github,https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/event/fosdem-2024-3029-are-project-tests-enough-for-automated-dependency-updates-a-case-study-of-262-java-projects-on-github/,"<p>Updating a new version of a third-party library is traditionally not a trivial task. Github's Dependabot, Renovate, and similar services automatically create a new branch with the latest version of a library dependency and then execute project tests to detect any breaking changes. While such services are gaining a lot of traction, no study looks into whether test suites of average GitHub Projects have sufficient coverage and are adequate to detect incompatible library changes.</p>
<p>To better understand the state of test coverage and effectiveness of project test suites for detecting incompatible library changes in open-source projects, I will, in this talk, present a study comprising 262 Java projects on GitHub. By artificially injecting faulty changes in library dependencies, we identify that test suites, on average, have coverage of 58% of their direct and 20% of their transitive dependencies. The average test suite effectively detects 47% of faulty updates in direct dependencies and 35% in transitive dependencies. Based on our findings, I will explain recommendations for developers and toolmakers that could improve the reliability and expectations of automated dependency updating.</p>",https://fosdem.org/2024/events/attachments/fosdem-2024-3029-are-project-tests-enough-for-automated-dependency-updates-a-case-study-of-262-java-projects-on-github/slides/22923/fosdem24-jhejderup_izmdloz.pdf
