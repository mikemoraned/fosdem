CERN's Open Source Storage Systems,fosdem-2024-3235-cern-s-open-source-storage-systems,"<p>CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research) is one of the world's largest and most respected centres for scientific research. It is home to the world's largest particle accelerator (<a href=""https://www.home.cern/science/accelerators/large-hadron-collider"">Large Hadron Collider, LHC</a>) and is the birthplace of the <a href=""https://www.home.cern/science/computing/birth-web"">Web</a>.</p>
<p>CERN's Storage and Data Management Group is responsible for enabling data storage and access for the CERN laboratory, in particular the long-term archival, preservation and distribution of LHC data to a worldwide scientific community (<a href=""https://wlcg.web.cern.ch/"">WLCG</a>). Today we operate  heterogeneous disk and tape software defined storage systems, with several large <a href=""https://eos-web.web.cern.ch/eos-web/"">EOS</a> disk farms, the <a href=""https://cta.web.cern.ch/cta/"">CERN Tape Archive (CTA)</a> system and other storage solutions. In total the group manages more than one exabyte of storage across about 2,000 data servers (60,000 disks) and 50,000 high-capacity tapes and orchestrates more than 4 exabytes of data transfers every year.  More than 30,000 users need to access these data from their computers in a user-friendly way, which has been made possible through the <a href=""https://cernbox.web.cern.ch/cernbox/"">CERNBox</a> project, CERN's open source cloud sync and share platform. The group also operates a large Ceph cluster (over 60 petabytes)  mostly to support the CERN OpenStack Cloud Computing infrastructure.</p>
<p>All of these systems are open source and available for use and hosting on-premise.</p>
<p>In this talk we would like to give you a high level view of the following technologies and how they work together to satisfy the storage needs of the organisation: from the early phases of data taking, to its distribution and final end-user analysis.</p>
<p>EOS provides a service for storing large amounts of physics data and user files (accounting today for more than 1 exabyte), with a focus on interactive and batch analysis with multi-protocol support (WebDAV, HTTP, FUSE, CIFS). It supports different authentication protocols (KRB5, X509, OIDC). </p>
<p>CTA (CERN Tape Archive) is the archival storage system for the custodial copy of all physics data at CERN. The CTA software provides a free and open source platform for managing data on magnetic tapes at scale.</p>

Deploying a hyper-converged infrastructure with Ceph across the Cloud-Edge Continuum,fosdem-2024-2974-deploying-a-hyper-converged-infrastructure-with-ceph-across-the-cloud-edge-continuum,"<p>The cloud-edge continuum encompasses a diverse range of infrastructures with varying sizes, performance levels, energy consumption profiles, and resource constraints. Within edge nodes, constrained resources may require the use of hyperconverged storage solutions. OpenNebula has recently integrated Ceph as the foundational SDS solution for these edge deployments. This innovation enables the dynamic deployment of nodes through orchestrated infrastructure provisioning (based on Terraform), autoconfiguration of Ceph and virtualization subsystems (through Ansible), and cloud-edge management (using OpenNebula). This presentation discusses the seamless integration of these components to automate edge location management and to provision additional edge nodes in multi-provider edge cloud environments, highlighting the effectiveness of Ceph as an edge storage solution and showcasing a live technical demonstration of this innovative open source model.</p>"
SMB for Linux with SMB3 POSIX extensions,fosdem-2024-1851-smb-for-linux-with-smb3-posix-extensions,"<p>While NFS is the canonical file protocol to mount remote file servers under Linux, BSDs and other Unix-like operating systems, SMB is the equivalent in the Windows world. Both NFS and SMB offer basically the same service: Remote access to files and directories. The Linux kernel has the ability to mount SMB shares from Samba and from Windows, but special Linux semantics is not properly covered. With the now deprecated SMB1 protocol there have been Unix extensions to make SMB1 a proper alternative to NFS.</p>
<p>For a couple of years now, work is going on to extend the current SMB3 protocol to make it a proper alternative to NFS with all semantics that Linux clients expect. This talk will present the current status and where we are with respect to SMB3 POSIX extensions.</p>"

Bootstrapping time on OpenBSD,fosdem-2024-1856-bootstrapping-time-on-openbsd,"<p>Some systems (for example cheap boards with no real time clock or servers with an empty CMOS battery) have little idea of time on startup and try to set actual time using NTP. If that also involves DNSSEC validated DNS requests, we have a bootstrap problem, since validating DNSSEC answers requires a valid idea of time. This talk discusses they way OpenBSD's NTP daemon solves this problem, providing a trustworthy time from startup.</p>"
Let's make people love domain names again,fosdem-2024-2316-let-s-make-people-love-domain-names-again,"<p>Domain names are not just web addresses; they are the lifeline of digital navigation and identity.

Bending geographic maps for enhanced railway space-time diagrams,fosdem-2024-2594-bending-geographic-maps-for-enhanced-railway-space-time-diagrams,"<p>Space-Time diagrams are crucial schematics for organizing railway traffic. However, their symbolic representation hides the reality of the railway infrastructure that supports the traffic. In <a href=""https://osrd.fr/en/"">Open Source Railway Designer</a>, we found it necessary to enhance the context related to the 'space' component of this diagram.</p>
<p>We developed a custom projection, bending a map to position the origin at the bottom, the destination at the top, and the path relatively straight in between. The outcomes reveal a vertically aligned map following the Space-Time diagram, but with precise infrastructure details alongside geographic context using Open Street Map data.</p>
<p>This presentation will delve into the technique, discussing the calculations, implementation methods, as well as my experience navigating this challenge as a graphics developer without domain knowledge.</p>"
MARECO algorithm: how to drive a train using the least amount of energy,fosdem-2024-2650-mareco-algorithm-how-to-drive-a-train-using-the-least-amount-of-energy,"<p>Trains are planned with margins compared to their fastest possible drive. Without them, they would not be able to catch up in case of a delay. A train departing 5 minutes late would arrive at least 5 minutes late. A driver accelerating or braking a bit slower than planned would inevitably be late. The entire transportation plan would fail.</p>
<p>Those margins/allowances consist of adding extra time to the total running time. This implies planning trains with a lower speed than the maximum they could physically drive.</p>
<p>There are many ways to lower the speed of a train along its trip, but one of them is particularely efficient in terms of energy savings. The algorithm MARECO, developped by SNCF, details an entire strategy for this purpose: how to plan a train that would intelligently drives slower in a way that consume the least amount of energy ?</p>
<p>In this talk we will go though the main ideas of the algorithm, then we will compare its efficiency to other margin distribution stratgies on a few relevant examples, and finally we will discuss the impact of this algorithm on train planning and operation.</p>"
Railway signaling: detecting conflicts in a complex world,fosdem-2024-2665-railway-signaling-detecting-conflicts-in-a-complex-world,"<p>OSRD is a railway toolbox designed for multiple use cases.
These tools have in common a reliance on railway infrastructure simulation and results analysis.
In order to perform short-term digital capacity management (STDCM) or operational studies, a fine grained simulation of railway signaling systems is necessary.
Every country has different signaling rules, and often multiple active signaling systems, sometimes even overlapping.
This raises a challenge: how do we decouple the complexity of railway signaling and the rest of the application code, while retaining acceptable performance?
In this presentation, we will present our modeling of signaling systems and how we use it to automatically detect scheduling conflicts.</p>

"Transportr: the Past, the Present and the Future",fosdem-2024-2363-transportr-the-past-the-present-and-the-future,"<p>The vision of the free Android app <a href=""https://transportr.app/"">Transportr</a> is to provide easy access to accurate public transport data; without proprietary code, tracking, and ads. By simply switching the region, Transportr presents the same consistent user interface for daily commutes in Berlin as for holidays in Nicaragua. Thanks to shared code with its alternative Öffi, Transportr had support for official and third-party public transport APIs of more than 60 regions from Europe and other parts of the world at its peak. Apps such as Transportr have potential to ease the path into an ecological future with a seamless experience for public transport users regardless of their location.</p>
<p>This talk gives a recap of Transportr's history and some notes on its current state, but is mostly meant to be a starting point for discussion about the future of the app, the potential of combining efforts with similar projects, and a call for contributions to the community!</p>"
Software needs of a volunteer operated heritage railway,fosdem-2024-1772-software-needs-of-a-volunteer-operated-heritage-railway,"<p>Heritage railways are often operated by volunteers who are not computer experts, but they need software and digital services to support various tasks from ticketing, support in day to tay operations to fundraising. There is a need for close contact between the open source world and the heritage railway world.

Property based testing in Elixir,fosdem-2024-3473-property-based-testing-in-elixir,"<p>As developers, we write unit tests in a TDD-style workflow for validating the behavior of our applications and libraries. However, all possible situations need to be manually thought out when writing the tests for the code. Property based testing aims to solve this by allowing the developer to specify behavior of their programs in terms of properties (invariants) of their code and then automatically generating tests that check if the property is indeed valid. In this talk, the key concepts of property based testing will be explained, along with clarifying examples, ranging from introductory snippets to more complex ‘real life’ scenarios. The examples will be written in Elixir; a functional programming language that runs on the Erlang virtual machine. The high level, flexible and expressive nature of the language make it an ideal fit for declaring properties against which a program can be checked.</p>"
Gleam in the machine: phantom types and the builder pattern.,fosdem-2024-2064-gleam-in-the-machine-phantom-types-and-the-builder-pattern-,"<p>Discussions about types often begin and end with the assertion that they make our programs safer, but how to get the most out of types can be a bit of a mystery. With the development of a type system for Elixir, multiple explorations for Erlang, and the steady growth of Gleam there is increasing demand for practical discussions on how types can be used to write better programs.</p>
<p>This talk explores one such technique, known as ""phantom types"". We will learn what phantom types are, why they can be useful, and see some examples of Gleam packages employing them in the wild to achieve safer APIs.</p>"

Evolve your (web)app while it is running,fosdem-2024-3258-evolve-your-web-app-while-it-is-running,"<p>From a model, we generate multiple running instances. When the model is updated, so are the instances.
This allows immediate feedback from user-interaction, while still developing your model.</p>
<p>The model is a state-description and has to be well-defined, because of this we manage it with the type-safety of Gleam.</p>
<p>The instances each contain an independent state. We want to migrate this state when the state description changes. Because of this, we generate the code for the instances in Core Erlang, and use BEAM facilities to upgrade the instances while running.</p>

Guess Less with Erlang Doctor,fosdem-2024-3278-guess-less-with-erlang-doctor,"<p>It is tough to figure why Erlang or Elixir code is failing, or how unknown software is working. When confronted with an unusual error, we might search for it in the code, which often gives multiple results, so we resort to guessing. We might also decide to trace with tools like dbg or recon, but here we need to guess, which functions to trace. I would like to show you a different approach, where the first step is to trace multiple modules or even whole apps. Then you can query, analyse, process and even execute the collected traces. The <a href=""https://github.com/chrzaszcz/erlang_doctor"">tool</a> itself is so simple, that you will be able to use it instantly.

Style as code: Using open source tooling to codify technical documentation style,fosdem-2024-2471-style-as-code-using-open-source-tooling-to-codify-technical-documentation-style,"<p>Defining style as code lets tools do the hard work of remembering the style and gives technical writers and engineers the feedback they need to produce better documentation. </p>
<p>Reading good documentation is deceptively easy, and writing good documentation which is easy to read is hard.

<p>In this presentation, we will cover:
- Why consistent style is valuable in improving accessibility, inclusivity, readability, and clarity of documentation
- The challenges of ensuring consistency, including managing exceptions and defining priorities of style rules.
- Managing change for divers audience needs on the audience
- Creating clear explanations so that writers feel empowered with knowledge rather than berated with pedantry
- Demonstrating open source tooling that solves these challenges using Vale, a configurable, open source tool, an extensible rule set, support for many markup languages, and editor and CI integrations.</p>

Drop the docs and embrace the model with Gaphor,fosdem-2024-2542-drop-the-docs-and-embrace-the-model-with-gaphor,"<p>Napoleon reportedly said that a good sketch is better than a long speech. This might make him the first practitioner of model based system engineering. MBSE is an approach to system engineering where document based communication is exchanged for building a domain model. This is typically done through graphical languages like UML or <a href=""https://sysml.org/"">SysML</a>. A model gives us the opportunity to query it, run tests against it and verify it's validity.</p>
<p>This talk will demonstrate how a model can be built with <a href=""https://gaphor.org/"">Gaphor</a> and how it's integration with the wider Python ecosystem can help us to prevent mistakes.

Experimenting with AI and LLM to make docs searchable through a chat application,fosdem-2024-2379-experimenting-with-ai-and-llm-to-make-docs-searchable-through-a-chat-application,"<p>ChatGPT is considered to bring the end to search engines. But it's also a pretty good liar, just making stories up. As chat-based search engines, powered by machine learning and artificial intelligence, use an LLM (Large Language Model), they have no other knowledge than an algorithm that predicts the most likely word that should follow the previous ones. On top of that, these LLMs are not up-to-date, as they are generated with a ""snapshot"" of available data at a specific date when the LLM is being developed.</p>
<p>But how do we cope with the challenge that our managers and end-users want us to provide a chat-based user interface that produces correct results?</p>
<p>At Azul, all our public knowledge about Java and the products we deliver is combined on docs.azul.com. It's a ""classic documentation"" website, generated as a static website based on AsciiDoc files. As Java lovers, we experimented with several free, open-source tools to make our docs chat-searchable.

Your web app is taking up too much RAM. Let's fix it!,fosdem-2024-2722-your-web-app-is-taking-up-too-much-ram-let-s-fix-it-,"<p>We've all seen the memes about Google Chrome devouring all the available RAM in your laptop. Is that only due to how the browser works or is it also our fault as web apps developers? In fact, modern JS apps are becoming increasingly complicated, so their compute and memory requirement are rising as well, with some famous websites even taking up entire gigabytes of memory. This does not only fill up the memory of your users devices, but can also cause crashes and performance drops. How do we monitor if that's the case, and how can we fix it? This talk will shed some light on the dark art of memory allocations and profiling, showing how some data structures and some JS frameworks are less efficient than others. Also, what are the tools that are available to measure it, such as the Chrome Memory Profiler and MemLab, showcasing some custom tooling I've built around those two.</p>"

"SemVer in the Rust ecosystem: breakage, tooling, and edge cases",fosdem-2024-2682-semver-in-the-rust-ecosystem-breakage-tooling-and-edge-cases,"<p>In theory, semantic versioning (SemVer) is simple: breaking changes require major versions. SemVer rules do not change over time. Crates always adhere to SemVer. Careful coding is enough to avoid accidental breaking changes.</p>
<p>None of those statements are true!</p>
<p>In practice, SemVer is complex and accidental breakage is common: 1 in 6 of the top 1000 Rust crates has violated semantic versioning at least once, frustrating both users and maintainers alike.</p>
<p>If you write Rust but don't have the time for a PhD in SemVer, this talk is for you. We'll take a practical look at SemVer in Rust: what it buys us, how Rust's features lead to strange SemVer edge cases, and how we can prevent accidental breakage using a SemVer linter called <a href=""https://crates.io/crates/cargo-semver-checks"">cargo-semver-checks</a>.</p>"

of components will we reuse? This talk will explore the future of the project, as well as some
of the challenges surrounding compilers, and the  very silly sounding but real problems of
bootstrapping and dogfooding. We will explore the stack of <code>rustc</code> crates that we leverage,
how we use them together, and how they will play a part once the compiler has advanced further.</p>"
Hardware pointer checks in a Rust application near you?,fosdem-2024-2322-hardware-pointer-checks-in-a-rust-application-near-you-,"<p>This talk presents a case study in taking a security-focused application to the
next level by modifying the Rust compiler to target a capability-based
architecture.</p>
<p>We will discuss CHERI, a system that enables hardware enforcement of safety
constraints at runtime using capabilities, and how we have added support for
CHERI to the Rust compiler in order to improve the security of CyberHive
Connect, an application that implements an end-to-end encrypted mesh network.</p>
<p>Connect can already boast a very high level of security when we consider the
protocols it uses, and we can argue that the application itself has many
potential vulnerabilities eliminated by being written in Rust. However, just
like most real world applications, Connect needs to make use of unsafe code in
areas such as the interface with the underlying operating system. This exposes
an attack surface in the form of code that the compiler can't guarantee will be
safe at runtime.</p>
<p>If, however, we make modifications to the Rust compiler to support transferring
knowledge about pointer provenance, bounds and other access restrictions to
CHERI's capability-based runtime enforcement, then in many cases we should be
able to eliminate the potential for unsafe situations to occur.</p>
<p>This talk will demonstrate what we have managed to achieve in terms of
producing a modified Rust compiler that can target CHERI architectures. We will
give an overview of what problems were solved by doing this and how we worked
towards getting our real world Rust application running on CHERI.</p>"

Friend or Foe Inside? Exploring In-Process Isolation to Maintain Memory Safety for Unsafe Rust,fosdem-2024-2632-friend-or-foe-inside-exploring-in-process-isolation-to-maintain-memory-safety-for-unsafe-rust,"<p>Rust provides unsafe language features to interact with hardware or call into non-Rust libraries. However, this shifts responsibility for ensuring memory safety to the developer. Failing to do so may lead to memory-safety violations in unsafe code, which can violate the safety of the entire application. In this talk, we explore in-process isolation with Memory Protection Keys as a mechanism to shield safe program sections from safety violations that may happen in unsafe sections. Our approach is easy to use and comprehensive, as it prevents heap and stack-based violations. We further compare process-based and in-process isolation mechanisms and the necessary requirements for data serialization, communication, and context switching. We specifically explored various Rust serialization crates such as Abomonation and bincode. Our results show that in-process isolation can be effective and efficient, permits for a high degree of automation, and also enables a notion of application rewinding where the safe program section may detect and safely handle violations in unsafe code. However, even for modestly sized arguments, the context switch cost starts to get dominated by the cost of data transfer between domains. Here, the Rust data serialization method used can significantly impact performance and thus, it is crucial to optimize it for the use case at hand.

The Four Horsemen of Bad Rust Code,fosdem-2024-2434-the-four-horsemen-of-bad-rust-code,"<p>In the right hands, Rust is an exceptionally powerful language. Yet, I frequently observe similar mistakes in Rust programming: treating it like C or Java and not fully utilizing its unique features. I've concluded that poor Rust coding often falls into a few distinct categories, which I've termed the '4 Horsemen of Bad Rust Code': Overengineering, Simplistic Design, Premature Optimization, and Neglect of Documentation and Testing. This talk will delve into these antipatterns and offer strategies to avoid them, aiming to share practical tips for writing more ergonomic and effective Rust code.
During the talk, we will gradually refactor a Rust code example, transforming it from a less optimal version to a more idiomatic and efficient one.</p>"

Despite its conciseness, reading and understanding code that abstracts over the <code>Service</code> trait proves challenging because of the heavy use of generics and intricacies of implementing non-boxed futures. This complexity raises the learning curve for beginner and intermediate Rust developers to become proficient in their favorite frameworks. In this talk, we will demystify the <code>Service</code> trait, explore practical examples from real-world codebases, and construct increasingly complex Tower layers from scratch.</p>
<p>*Hyper actually relies on its own very similar <code>hyper::Service</code> trait.</p>"
Embedding Servo in Rust projects,fosdem-2024-2321-embedding-servo-in-rust-projects,"<p>Servo project have got a renewed activity since 2023 after a few slow years. One of the goals for this year has been making Servo a practical embeddable rendering engine, making easier to embed it in Rust projects. We’ve already come a long way in this area. A key achievement is our development of a minibrowser, which showcases how the Servo engine can be integrated.</p>
<p>In this talk, the main focus will be on the embedding of Servo. We will dive into the technical aspects of the minibrowser, demonstrating how our developments have streamlined the process of embedding Servo, the challenges we’ve faced, and the solutions we’ve developed. Additionally, we will also talk about the future direction of Servo embedding in Rust projects.</p>"

Part of the work we have been doing in the background to enable this evolution is adding support for Rust to the Thunderbird code base.</p>
<p>In this talk, we'll tell the story of how we achieved this and what lessons we learned along the way. We’ll also show how we’re using Rust to both improve the existing code architecture, and build new features for Thunderbird such as support for Microsoft Exchange.</p>"
Fighting cancer with Rust,fosdem-2024-2603-fighting-cancer-with-rust,"<p>Biospecimens and high-quality clinical data are essential for cancer research. At the same time, health data is highly sensitive with regards to data protection, hence, instead of centralizing all the data, federated information systems enable researchers to locate and work with data/biospecimens having certain characteristics, e.g. specimen type, diagnosis, and molecular markers, across hospitals, countries, or even continents. At the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Germany’s largest biomedical research center, we develop, operate, and maintain such national infrastructures in hospitals and biobanks around Germany, Europe and the world, using 100% FLOSS. Recently, we have re-implemented and open-sourced key components in Rust with great benefits towards stability, safety and performance. In particular, we report on Beam, a distributed task broker for efficient communication across strict network environments, and Focus, a federated query dispatcher protecting patient privacy using differential privacy.</p>"
The journey of hacking in a new serde dataformat,fosdem-2024-2420-the-journey-of-hacking-in-a-new-serde-dataformat,"<p>The latest version of <a href=""https://github.com/neo4j-labs/neo4rs""><code>neo4rs</code></a>—a Rust driver for the Neo4j graph database developed under the ""Neo4j Labs"" incubator—changes its API for reading data to use serde.

U-Boot for modern Qualcomm phones,fosdem-2024-1716-u-boot-for-modern-qualcomm-phones,"<p>Bootloaders are one of the biggest pain points when it comes to booting upstream
Linux on Qualcomm devices, they require that distros support 4 versions of the Android
boot image header, weird non-standard devicetree properties, and are
generally a huge headache. As modifying the bootloader is out of the question,
we can at least replace the environment it gives us with a more sensible one.
In this talk, I'll give a brief introduction to what an EFI bootloader actually is,
how they work, and how U-Boot fits into the picture as a second-stage
bootloader. I'll cover the work I've been doing to improve Qualcomm support in
upstream U-Boot, and how we can drastically lower the barrier of entry for
distro support on Qualcomm phones.</p>

"Mainline Linux on Qualcomm SoCs, are we here now ?",fosdem-2024-1707-mainline-linux-on-qualcomm-socs-are-we-here-now-,"<p>Yes, and we’re in pretty good shape!</p>
<p>For the last 10 years, Qualcomm’s engineers and Linaro’s Qualcomm Landing Team has been working hard to carefully implement Linux mainline support for Qualcomm platforms, and so far so good it’s pretty good now as you can judge with the very good Thinkpad X13S support.</p>
<p>Neil will do a tour of all supported platforms, describe the work the Linaro’s Qualcomm Landing Team has achieved so far and the key features engineers are working on.
The Qualcomm SoCs are notoriously very complex and very powerful, and implementing clean, correct, maintainable and extensible support for mainline Linux is particularly hard.
Key domains like Power or DSP management were particularly hard to support, with those in good shape multimedia, connectivity and network features getting enabled permitting Qualcomm based devices to offer excellent support while running vanilla (unmodified) Linux kernel !</p>
<p>The Thinkpad X13S is a great example of such support, because until recently it was limited to expensive and hard to buy Qualcomm Reference platforms.</p>
<p>Nevertheless the Qualcomm Reference platforms also get as early as possible mainline support, without any concessions on code quality, like the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 mailing-list patches delivered on marketing announcement day.</p>

Genode on the PinePhone on track to real-world usability,fosdem-2024-3017-genode-on-the-pinephone-on-track-to-real-world-usability,"<p>Since the introduction of Genode for the PinePhone at this developer room one
year ago, this alternative mobile OS has matured to the point of real-world
usability for a group of pilot users. In this talk, Genode developer Norman
Feske is going to share the experiences made along the way, reiterate the many
advances, demonstrate the current version, and ask: What should come next?</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Genode on the PinePhone realizes a new vision of a smartphone OS designed from
the ground up for user autonomy. Following the announcement of the very first
version at the FOSS-on-Mobile developer room in 2023, the system got into the
hands of a group of pilot users. The talk will share this experience
and highlight the key points we met towards our goal of real-world usability.</p>
<p>First, we found it important to attain a tight feedback loop between testers
and us developers, which prompted us to create a system-update mechanism that
allows for instantly updating the system, or rolling it back to any previous
version. Now, a new version can reach the hands of testers in a matter of
seconds.</p>
<p>With the quick way of testing new versions in place, the feedback we got
regarding our attempts at implementing energy-saving measures - in particular
screen blanking - was quite instructive to attain a refined solution. At a
technical level, the solution is interesting as it combines a Forth-based
custom power-management firmware with Genode's microkernel-based architecture.
Don't worry, the talk will only briefly touch those eccentricities.</p>
<p>With the power drain reduced to a practical level, we turned our
attention to the application level. The talk will briefly introduce our
SDK named Goa, which streamlines the development to the point
where almost unmodified Qt/QML-based applications can be targeted at the
Genode-based phone. To stress the latter point, we made the Linphone VoIP
stack available on this system.</p>
<p>The talk will be garnished by practical demonstrations. Besides being thrilled
to present the current state, I'm eager to gather feedback from the community
about the most worthwhile directions for the next year.</p>"

Why not run OpenCL-accelerated LLM on your phone?,fosdem-2024-3364-why-not-run-opencl-accelerated-llm-on-your-phone-,"<p>Many of us were drawn to Linux by the amazing possibilities and combinations we could create while running the operating system. Such things were often not possible back then with operating systems like Windows.</p>
<p>Now, history is repeating itself with Android and iOS. Most of the devices we buy are highly locked and restricted, limiting our ability to do what we want on these devices. Even after spending many hours recompiling the entire system or patching it, there's no guarantee of achieving satisfactory results.</p>
<p>Linux allows us to do incredible things, encouraging experimentation, play, and learning.</p>

The Journey to Ubuntu Touch 20.04 on PINE64,fosdem-2024-2851-the-journey-to-ubuntu-touch-20-04-on-pine64,"<p>This talk delves into the evolution of Ubuntu Touch on PINE64 devices since its release in 2020. Over the past several years there have been significant changes, both to the development team and the codebase.  </p>
<p>The shifts in the UBPorts/PINE64 community stem from the original PinePhone port’s maintainer moving on from the project, which coincided with the release of the PinePhone Pro. This left the community at a crossroads: necessitating the search for a new maintainer and the development of a new port.  </p>
<p>A key milestone in this journey was the showcasing of an early-stage community port for the PinePhone Pro running on Ubuntu Touch 20.04 at FOSDEM last year. Since then, a new maintainer has achieved remarkable improvements, including porting 20.04 to the original PinePhone and PineTab, as well as the newly released PineTab2.  </p>
<p>This presentation will explore the challenges encountered in integrating new devices, updating existing ones, and the process of harmonizing mainline Linux with Ubuntu Touch. This is particularly crucial as Ubuntu Touch has historically leaned towards devices designed for Android/Halium-based devices, somewhat sidelining mainline Linux in the transition to 20.04. Furthermore, the discussion will extend to the future prospects of this port and its implications for Lomiri on mainline Linux across different distributions.</p>"
Towards a bright future with Mobian?,fosdem-2024-3290-towards-a-bright-future-with-mobian-,"<p>Mobile Linux is no longer a new thing, and we reached a point where many users daily drive Linux-based phones, which are getting more usable over time. Despite being a significant improvement, there are still a lot of challenges to overcome and many more problems to solve.</p>

We will also present and discuss our plans for the foreseeable future, as well as the improvements we're contributing to the wider ecosystem in the process.</p>"
Daily blogging embedded Gecko development,fosdem-2024-2508-daily-blogging-embedded-gecko-development,"<p>The Gecko rendering engine is used in many weird and wonderful places. For over a decade it has been the stock rendering engine for the default browser on Sailfish OS, a Linux-based mobile operating system for use on mobile phones and tablets.</p>
<p>The browser implementation was originally developed around the EmbedLite/xulrunner API, which is no longer officially supported. This provides interesting challenges for keeping the browser up-to-date with the latest Gecko changes.</p>
<p>For the last 92 days (maybe more depending on when you're reading this) I've been <a href=""https://www.flypig.co.uk/gecko"">daily-blogging</a> about my experiences upgrading the ESR 78 Gecko rendering engine used on Sailfish OS to ESR 91. Once ESR 91 is complete the plan is to move to ESR 102 and beyond. Eventually we hope to reach a stable rhythm alongside the official Gecko releases.</p>
<p>This has been a communal effort, with other members of the Sailfish OS community helping with the development, from submitting changes to tooling to creating AI-generated images to liven up the blog posts. Many users from the community are now involved all with the singular aim of getting our Gecko upgraded. The breadth of technologies involved (Rust, C++, JavaScript, Python) makes it a fascinating project to work with and write about.</p>
<p>We've learnt a lot about the Gecko codebase in the process as well as the challenges in deploying Gecko to unusual mobile and embedded platforms. Our hope is that once we reach the latest version, we'll be able to look into contributing more changes upstream to help maintain our Gecko deployment more easily in the future. We'd love to discuss the best way to achieve this.</p>
<p>In this talk I'll share my experiences of working with Gecko in an open way and in collaboration with the community, before opening it out to a discussion about how best to work with upstream.</p>

Public calendars aggregation using Linkal,fosdem-2024-3443-public-calendars-aggregation-using-linkal,"<p>Calendars are a building block of our work tools. Unfortunately, managing calendars is often a nightmare. The reason for this is simple: the big companies hosting most of the calendar services are not trying very hard to provide interroperability between their services, or facilitate the use of calendars not hosted by themselves.
One particular setting that is very painful when using calendars is the case of public-calendars. While a lot of organizations have a public-calendar available to stay informed about the events they organize, it is actually very complicated to leverage these calendars in a natural way:
First of all, not all caldav clients support public-calendars, or at least not as well as “account” calendars. Often, they allow to “bulk import” multiples ical events inside your calendar client but not suscribe to the underlying calendar. This means that new events will not be added to your calendar automatically;
    Public-calendars are not easily composable: it is not possible to merge multiple public-calendars together in order for example to share a collection of calendars;
    It is not possible to filter events in public-calendars. We may be interested only in a subset of events in a calendar (events occuring on mondays for example, or taking place in Paris, or any other criterion).</p>
<p><a href=""https://github.com/JulienMalka/Linkal"">Linkal</a> is a software developped to solve the above problems. It is a public-calendar aggregator server. It acts as a man-in-the-middle between a caldav client and some public-calendars. Given a list of public-calendar, it emulates a calendar collection containing all these calendars. The user can then use its usual caldav client and add the collection as an “account” calendar (specifying the url of the Linkal instance instead of the caldav server). This allows the collection to be shared easily to multiple users and seamlessly updated.</p>
<p>The talk will present the challenges to collaborations using calendars and the solutions that Linkal provides.</p>"

Nextcloud on the other hand, embraces the ethics and challenges that make up today’s AI and aims to take them head on.</p>
<p>The field of AI is moving fast, and many of the new capabilities face ethical and even legal challenges.</p>
<p>For example, there are problems with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Privacy and security of user data</li>
<li>Discrimination and biases</li>
<li>Energy usage</li>
</ul>
<p>In particular with neural networks based AI technologies, the mere availability of open source code is no longer enough to be able to say you are in control over your data or that the software is safe or ethical. The set of data and the software used in the training, as well as the availability of the final model are all factors that determine the amount of freedom and control a user has.</p>
<p>Until Hub 3, we succeeded in offering features like related resources, recommended files, our priority inbox and even face and object recognition without reliance on proprietary blobs or third party servers.</p>
<p>Yet, while there is a large community developing ethical, safe and privacy-respecting technologies, there are many other relevant technologies users might want to use. We want to provide users these cutting-edge technologies – but also be transparent. For some use cases, ChatGPT might be a reasonable solution, while for other data, it is paramount to have a local, on-prem, open solution. To differentiate these, we developed an Ethical AI Rating.</p>
<p>Our Ethical AI Rating is designed to give a quick insight into the ethical implications of a particular integration of AI in Nextcloud. We of course still encourage users to look more deeply into the specific solution they use, but hope that this way we simplify the choice for the majority of our users and customers.</p>
<p>I will describe how our Ethical AI rating works, and give a bunch of examples. And, as a bonus, show how it is integrated in Nextcloud and how it can help you get work done - without leaking your data!</p>
<p>I look forward to any feedback you wonderful folks in the audience have.</p>"
Web Accessibility and Environmental Sustainability and with Popular CMS,fosdem-2024-3317-web-accessibility-and-environmental-sustainability-and-with-popular-cms,"<p>Web Accessibility has a lot of complexities, and most CMS do not have the capacity to invest in it sufficiently. Two years ago Funka organized a Cross-CMS initiative to look at supporting content authors in their efforts to produce accessible content. This EC funded initiative, the We4Authors Cluster brought together Drupal, Joomla, Plone, and Umbreco. This is the only cross-CMS accessibility event I am aware of where maintainers collaborated on common UI elements. It is also the only one I am aware of where user research was done on authors, to help evaluate accessibility. We need more of this.  </p>
<p>Currently, Environmental Sustainability in the CMS space is given even less of a priority than accessibility. We are in a climate crisis, digital tools are contributing to it, global best practices are emerging, but adoption of these best practices isn't happening fast enough. Collaboration is needed to both raise awareness within our industry, but also find common solutions. Finding common approaches to measure the CO2 impact is an important starting point. Much more will be needed if we are to help the web make significant reductions in energy consumption. </p>
<p>These are two places where collaboration is key if we are able to make the advances which are needed for people with disabilities, as well as future generations. Where can we help to optimize our development process, code execution, and the cumulative impact of CO2 produced through the process.</p>"
How to get rid of Confluence: Comparing Open Source Knowledgemanagent Systems,fosdem-2024-2781-how-to-get-rid-of-confluence-comparing-open-source-knowledgemanagent-systems,"<p>Atlassian, the proprietary Australian vendor and market leader of Knowledge Management recently has been massively raising prices and pushing their customers into their cloud.

The Challenges of Creating a FOSS Fact-Checking Platform for the Brazilian Community,fosdem-2024-1945-the-challenges-of-creating-a-foss-fact-checking-platform-for-the-brazilian-community,"<p>AletheiaFact.org is a movement for the democratization of fact-checking in Brazil, which aims to empower ordinary citizens to check and monitor information in order to prevent the harmful spread of fake news and create a digital community engaged in teaching, learning and sharing knowledge on the subject. We are also a technological platform that offers tools in workflow format to make fact-checking processes accessible and feasible for everyone.</p>
<p>In an era where misinformation can spread rapidly, establishing robust and reliable fact-checking platforms is crucial. This presentation delves into the unique journey of developing a Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) fact-checking platform specifically for the Brazilian community. We explore the intersection of technology, journalism, and civic engagement in the context of Brazil's diverse and dynamic information landscape.</p>
<p>Brazil, with its rich cultural and linguistic diversity, presents unique challenges in misinformation management. Our project aims not only to address these challenges but also to harness the power of the open-source community in creating a transparent and accountable fact-checking tool. We will discuss the technical hurdles in building a scalable and effective platform, including aspects like real-time data analysis, integration with various media formats, and ensuring user-friendly interfaces that cater to a broad audience.</p>
<p>Additionally, we focus on the vital role of community engagement in the development and adoption of the platform. The talk will cover strategies for fostering an active open-source community around the project, encouraging collaboration, and ensuring the platform evolves in response to the community's needs.</p>"
Emulation Tools for Sustainable Software Development: Simulating Real-World Usage Scenarios,fosdem-2024-2707-emulation-tools-for-sustainable-software-development-simulating-real-world-usage-scenarios,"<p>In this talk, I will demonstrate how emulation tools can improve your efficiency and help you meet quality standards. Emulation tools simulate user actions on a computer and can be used for a variety of tasks, including testing software and automating repetitive tasks.</p>
<p>Using emulation tools such as xdotool, actiona, and KDE Eco Tester, I will demonstrate how to automate the creation of usage scenarios, as well as share my experience working on preparing KDE applications Kate and Gcompris for Blue Angel Eco Certification. You will learn how these tools can help you save time and effort, and ensure that your software meets eco-friendliness and quality standards.</p>
<p>While emulation tools can be incredibly helpful, they also have their drawbacks. They may not always accurately simulate real-world scenarios and can be complex to set up and use. However, with the right approach, they can be a valuable asset for developers, testers, and anyone interested in sustainable and energy-efficient software. I will provide solutions to these challenges based on my experience working with these tools.</p>"

GNU Health. Incorporating Digital Public Goods in the European healthcare system,fosdem-2024-2666-gnu-health-incorporating-digital-public-goods-in-the-european-healthcare-system,"<p>GNU Health is a free/libre health and hospital information system with strong focus on public health and social medicine. It has been declared a Digital Public Good.
In this talk we'd like to talk about the history of GNU Health, its adoption in health systems around the world,  the importance of being a Digital Public Good and the integration with other sister DPG projects like Orthanc.
We'd also talk about the current efforts to integrate GNU Health and other DPGs in the European healthcare system. We'll mention some projects like FSFE ""Public Money, Public Code"" and other initiatives like JoinUp to make Free Software a reality in the European public administration in general, and, specifically,  in the healthcare system</p>"
The Orthanc ecosystem for medical imaging,fosdem-2024-2641-the-orthanc-ecosystem-for-medical-imaging,"<p>Medical imaging plays a crucial role in modern healthcare, enabling accurate diagnoses and effective treatment planning. However, the management and accessibility of vast amounts of imaging data present significant challenges. Orthanc, a free and open-source, lightweight, and extensible software, has emerged as a recognized solution for medical imaging data management.</p>
<p>Orthanc serves as a vendor-neutral archive, facilitating the cost-effective storage, retrieval, and sharing of various imaging modalities, including X-ray, MRI, CT scans, and more. Its modular design allows seamless integration into existing healthcare systems. Orthanc's compliance with the DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) and DICOMweb interoperability standards ensures compatibility across different imaging devices and platforms, fostering collaborative research and multidisciplinary healthcare approaches.</p>
<p>Key features of Orthanc include its user-friendly interface, scalability, and support for advanced functionalities like de-identification and encryption, ensuring patient data security and privacy compliance. Multiple Web viewers are integrated into Orthanc, such as OHIF, Kitware VolView, and the Stone Web viewer. Orthanc also comes with a REST API that can be used to script imaging workflows, which is widely used to set up auto-routing between local DICOM servers or between remote sites. Furthermore, its ability to incorporate machine learning algorithms for image analysis and processing opens avenues for automated diagnosis, treatment planning, and research advancements.</p>
<p>Digital Public Goods Alliance recognized Orthanc as a digital public good in August 2023. This underscores the commitment of the Orthanc community to contribute to Sustainable Development Goals 3 and 9 (health, innovation, infrastructure).</p>
<p>In conclusion, Orthanc stands as a robust, versatile, and adaptable software solution for the efficient management and utilization of medical imaging data.

From disconnected elements to a harmonious ecosystem: The Epiverse-TRACE project,fosdem-2024-2658-from-disconnected-elements-to-a-harmonious-ecosystem-the-epiverse-trace-project,"<p>There is an increasing trend of packaging and sharing tools in the epidemiology research community. But these tools remain difficult to use and to integrate in a data analysis pipeline. There is a need for a more integrated approach, ensuring that the various tools work well with one another. For example, minimal data wrangling should be needed to transform the output of one tool before passing it to the next tool down the data analysis pipeline. Similarly, various alternatives for a single step of the pipeline should as much as possible use the same inputs and return the same outputs. In this talk, I will present how the Epiverse-TRACE project collaborates with many R package developers in epidemiology to integrate their tools in a unified universe. Indeed, the unique and challenging feature of Epiverse is that it doesn’t intend to create a unified universe from scratch, but instead aims at updating existing external pieces of software to better work together. This talk will explain how we identify the key parts that should be updated, and how we make these updates with minimal disruption to the individual package developers and established community of users.</p>"

"Deploy Fast, Without Breaking Things: Level Up APIOps With OpenTelemetry",fosdem-2024-1710-deploy-fast-without-breaking-things-level-up-apiops-with-opentelemetry,"<p>For developers building distributed applications, few things are more frustrating than having an API break unexpectedly. When an API changes in a backwards-incompatible way, it can disrupt downstream consumers. Suddenly, applications start failing, integrations break, and developers are left scrambling to fix the issues.</p>
<p>How can developers deploy changes fast without breaking APIs and maintain stability for consumers? By adding modern observability techniques to their APIOps pipeline.</p>
<p>In this talk, we will start together from a traditional APIOps pipeline in ArgoCD and explore how incorporating modern observability techniques can help developers deploy changes quickly and efficiently while maintaining stability for API consumers.</p>
<p>In this presentation, Sonja (Group Product Manager in the API space) and Adnan (5 years in the observability space) are combining their expertise to present best practices for detecting and resolving API issues in production.</p>
<p>This talk will be helpful for developers working with APIs, helping them extend their GitOps practices by using distributed tracing in pre-production to identify and fix issues before they reach production.</p>

Bad UX is Bad Security: Adventures in Qubes OS UX Design,fosdem-2024-3135-bad-ux-is-bad-security-adventures-in-qubes-os-ux-design,"<p>There's little love for design and UX in many security-related FOSS projects. After all, why should anyone care about the looks of something created (mostly) for expert users? As long as it works, the user interface is not really important, isn’t it? Designers will often answer with indignation, appeal to possible wider audiences, or just give up on arguing with the hackers. However, bad UX is bad not just for the so-called ""normal people"". Even the experts are human, and as humans are susceptible to cognitive biases and mistakes; and while privacy and security are great, they are even better when available widely and comfortably, so that their users are not obviously recognizable as ""people with something to hide"".</p>
<p>For the last several years, I have been working on improving the UX of Qubes OS, a security-focused operating system. In this talk, I will share the insights this work brought me on how improving UX can lead to better security, discuss how user research methods can be used to improve not just the feel of the software, but also its security, and discuss insights from cognitive psychology that can help us create more secure designs.</p>

There are over 2,000 applicants for each cohort of the open source internship, and only 63 interns are chosen in my cohort. The application procedure is divided into three stages: the initial application period, the contribution period, and the intern selection period. During the first application round, applicants are required to write four essays describing how they have experienced underrepresentation in their local technological community. If applicants are chosen, they can then proceed to the contribution stage. 
             Now, this is where me contributing to open source begins. I contributed to the Unstructured Studio community, Unstructured studio develop tools, activities and resources to engage children from underserved communities in a creative learning experience. Contributing to the Unstructured Studio community was competitive, because this one of the few communities where designers could intern with.
Contributions were made on GitHub and before contributing to this community, I thought GitHub was an open source software used alone by developers so I didn’t think it would be possible to contribute to open source as a designer but trying to get into this internship and my desire to learn made me realise that I could contribute to open source on GitHub and as well collaborate with developers and designers. 
The presentation will cover the challenges and successes of contributing to open source as a designer. How I was able to successfully contribute to open source as a designer and get selected for the internship and to also inspire fellow designers to make use of open source softwares and contribute to them.</p>"

Picture the scene, you're leading a popular open source project used by tens of thousands of businesses, and suddenly your founding company and primary funder steps back from the project.  What will happen to the project? How do we move forward given that all of our governance model and decision making was tied up with the founding company?</p>
<p>This session will explore some of the governance challenges that faced Mautic when this situation arose back in April 2023, and in particular we'll dive into more detail on how we developed an entirely new governance model and decision making process.</p>
<p>We will touch on issues including how we actually went about creating a new community-driven governance model in a collaborative way, allowing members of the community to have a say, through to the practicalities of how we implemented our new Community Portal for democratic decision making.</p>
<p>This session is for you if you're curious about all things governance and open source, if you'd like to know more about collaborative decision making and how this can be facilitated with open source software.</p>"
Meritocracy or Do-ocracy - why diversity is still hard and what can we do,fosdem-2024-2310-meritocracy-or-do-ocracy-why-diversity-is-still-hard-and-what-can-we-do,"<p>A lot of open source project is led by meritocracy. However, we all agree that this may not be the best model to encourage diversity in the community. Recently there has been a rise of do-ocracy, which means anyone and stand up and do it. Is this the best alternative we can have? Are there downfalls?</p>
<p>Goal:</p>
<p>This talk can provoke thoughts about what is a better leadership model for open-source projects. We have come a long way to improve diversity and inclusion of the open-source ecosystem but the battle does not stop here.

Please Make It Make Sense: Product Management Methods to Make Your Project's Purpose Clear,fosdem-2024-1693-please-make-it-make-sense-product-management-methods-to-make-your-project-s-purpose-clear,"<p>In this talk I'll share lessons learned over years spent as a program manager and product manager contributing to open source projects, mostly in the cloud native space. I'll explain how backlog refinement, prioritization, roadmapping, user research and data collection, and project management basics can help your project stand out as uniquely valuable in a crowded landscape—drawing from real-world examples. To help you gain clarity on your project's goals and core attributes, I'll talk about how to overcome ""assumption-driven development"" to become a better listener to your users. Throughout, I'll also show you how incorporating product management methods can help you to avoid frustration and burnout, whether you're a maintainer or a contributor. </p>
<p>This talk will provide an overview of select techniques used by product managers to drive decision-making, focus, and results-oriented experimentation. These techniques will be presented in a manner that takes into consideration the realities and practicalities of trying to achieve development goals in the open source context. For those of you working in open source as part of your day jobs, I'll also discuss how to align your project's delivery objectives with your employer's product roadmap so that you increase the chances of getting the staffing, support, and recognition you want.</p>
<p>By the end, you will hopefully take away new knowledge and insights into how to tame your backlog, surface your core objectives and problems to be solved, make your users happier, and keep yourselves—and your fellow contributors—productive with purpose.</p>"

Single-vendor is the new proprietary,fosdem-2024-2190-single-vendor-is-the-new-proprietary,"<p>As more and more software companies decide to abandon open source licenses to adopt source-available or non-compete licenses, it is time to take a step back. Is open source less interesting than it was when the Open Source Initiative was created 25 years ago? Or is it just a short-sighted, investor-driven move to extract incrementally more value to the detriment of the whole ecosystem?</p>
<p>In this talk, Thierry Carrez, General Manager at the OpenInfra Foundation and vice-chair at the Open Source Initiative, will look critically at those recent developments. He will replace them in historical context, explain the origin and value of the permissionless innovation that we currently all enjoy, and reassert the virtue of software developed in an open collaboration, compared to single-vendor software.</p>"

Making reproducible and publishable large-scale HPC experiments,fosdem-2024-2651-making-reproducible-and-publishable-large-scale-hpc-experiments,"<p>For a long time, scientific publications focused only on experimental results, ignoring how, <em>concretely</em>, the results were obtained, making difficult for readers, but also for the author, to reproduce the experiments. Things are slowly changing: publication of so-called ""artifacts"" are encouraged by journals and conferences. However, releasing scripts and programs used for experiments can be challenging: how to organize the material? how to clearly document the instructions? how to ensure reproducibility of the experiments? how to ensure long-term availability? Several answers are possible to all these questions. In this talk, I will try to summarize how and why my methodology to build reproducible artifacts evolved over several years in the research area.</p>"

CATS: The Climate Aware Task Scheduler,fosdem-2024-2567-cats-the-climate-aware-task-scheduler,"<p>The Climate-Aware Task Scheduler is a lightweight Python package designed to schedule tasks based on the estimated carbon intensity of the electricity grid at any given moment. This tool uses real-time carbon intensity data from the UK's National Grid ESO via their API to estimate the carbon intensity of the electricity grid, and schedules tasks at times when the estimated carbon intensity is lowest. This helps to reduce the carbon emissions associated with running computationally intensive tasks, making it an ideal solution for environmentally conscious developers. Currently CATS is built to work with the simple ""at"" scheduler, but work is underway to port it to Slurm.

Overcoming MPI ABI incompatibility,fosdem-2024-1916-overcoming-mpi-abi-incompatibility,"<p>Scientific applications rely on third-party libraries, which may have multiple implementations with  many of these implementations not sharing the application binary interface (ABI) and require recompiling depending on the target system. Recompiling can be a long and complex process, (1) impeding application execution across different HPC and Cloud systems; (2) adding developer hours rebuilding an application; and (3) not taking advantage of host-optimized libraries.</p>
<p>The <a href=""https://github.com/cea-hpc/wi4mpi"">Wi4MPI library</a>, developed at CEA, addresses this ABI incompatibility in MPI. Wi4MPI translates the ABI dynamically from the MPI library used to build the application to a different MPI library available at run time. With Wi4MPI, HPC practitioners can break the portability barrier imposed by ABI incompatibility, potentially increase performance, and increase user productivity. This presentation is broken down in three components: (1) Understanding ABI compatibility in MPI; (2) Translating MPI libraries dynamically; and (3) Applying dynamic translation to key use cases in HPC, including Containers.</p>"
AOMP Compiler Kung Fu: Mastering Optimization Flags and Environment Variables for Performance,fosdem-2024-2732-aomp-compiler-kung-fu-mastering-optimization-flags-and-environment-variables-for-performance,"<p>The world’s largest supercomputers get most of their potential from their GPU accelerators. As such, it is essential to target GPUs when running on such powerful machines. Given the desire for portability of applications, OpenMP offloading is a popular way to accelerate applications on GPUs.</p>
<p>This talk presents the ROCm OpenMP offloading compiler from two perspectives: compiler flags and compiler/runtime implementation. Given that it may be critical to use the right compiler flags, the talk presents some of the tuning knobs that the ROCm OpenMP compiler exposes to users. It will go into more detail of what optimization, feature, and parameter the specific compiler flags enable. For each of the compiler flags listed, the talk will present information on what occurs in the compiler and the runtime library. For several of these switches, the talk presents performance results.</p>
<p>In particular, the talk covers the high-level flag <code>-fopenmp-target-fast</code> and what optimizations are enabled by that switch. It will then go into more detail about the specific flags for the selected underlying optimizations and their user-facing parameter options that allow for fine-tuning in certain scenarios. Specifically, the talk covers the following flags:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>-fopenmp-gpu-threads-per-team</code>: This switch controls kernel launch parameters considered during the compiler’s code generation phase, which can impact things like register allocation.</li>
<li><code>-fopenmp-target-big-jump-loop</code>: This switch enables a more optimized form of loops for running on the GPU that is closer to traditional block-languages like CUDA or HIP.</li>
<li><code>-fopenmp-target-no-loop</code>: This switch enables the generation of CUDA-like code without any loop executed on the device. The talk outlines which conditions must be met to allow the compiler to generate such GPU code.</li>
<li><code>-fopenmp-target-xteam-reductions</code>: A special form of reduction kernels that can greatly benefit the performance of reductions. One of its main tuning knobs is the blocksize.</li>
<li><code>-fopenmp-target-xteam-reduction-blocksize</code>: The xteam reductions blocksize and what are the implications.</li>
<li><code>-fopenmp-force-usm</code>: This flag is a convenient switch that enables the compiler to emit code as if the user specified <code>#pragma omp unified_shared_memory</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the compiler flags, the runtime offers additional configurability via environment variables. Some of these variables influence the very same mechanisms, whereas other provide separate mechanisms. The talk gives an overview of some of these variables and how they influence execution.</p>

Extracting Mini-Apps from HPC software for Total Cost of Ownership optimized systems procurement,fosdem-2024-2117-extracting-mini-apps-from-hpc-software-for-total-cost-of-ownership-optimized-systems-procurement,"<p>When procuring new hardware for an HPC system, the hardware vendors can be provided with targets to hit. This can either be performance per dollar but more recently also includes metrics like performance per watt. Industry standard benchmarks like <a href=""https://www.top500.org/project/linpack/"">Linpack</a>, <a href=""https://www.cs.virginia.edu/stream/"">Stream</a>, or <a href=""https://www.spec.org/benchmarks.html"">Spec</a> are not necessarily representative for the jobs that will actually run on the system and their predicted performance per dollar or watt might not be accurate when users run their tasks on the system. At the association for national high performance computing (<a href=""https://www.nhr-verein.de/"">NHR</a>) we are developing a pipeline to generate a representative benchmark collection from an observed job mix to provide to hardware vendors. One essential step is the so called mini-app extraction. A mini-app is a standalone kernel of a given HPC application, making it significantly smaller in terms of lines of code but retaining the computational characteristic of the original application. Based on these mini-apps vendors can better suite there hardware offerings to the expected use. As mini-apps usually need to be crafted manually by domain experts, we are developing <a href=""https://git.rwth-aachen.de/tim.heldmann/CTUApex"">Mini-Apex</a>. Mini-Apex is an open source compiler tool based on Clang, able to help extract mini-apps from C and C++ applications. It uses a <a href=""https://github.com/tudasc/MetaCG"">MetaCG</a> to generate a call-graph with attached analysis results, and <a href=""https://github.com/tudasc/PIRA"">PIRA</a> to identify the kernel.
It then extract the kernel-function, as well as all necessary sub-routines, variables, classes, structs, and definitions into a mini-app, reusing most of the build system of the original application.</p>"
"PyPartMC: engineering Python-to-Fortran bindings in C++, for use in Julia and Matlab",fosdem-2024-2338-pypartmc-engineering-python-to-fortran-bindings-in-c-for-use-in-julia-and-matlab,"<p>The talk will outline the technical lessons learned in development of the PyPartMC project (https://pypi.org/p/PyPartMC). The key goal of PyPartMC is to provide a maintainable multi-platform pip-installable package enabling interoperability between the Python ecosystem and the internal components of PartMC – an open-source aerosol dynamics simulation package. The wrapped PartMC package (https://lagrange.mechse.illinois.edu/partmc) has been in active development for almost two decades and is used in computational research ranging from process studies on ice formation in clouds to large-scale simulations of air pollution evolution coupled with weather forecasting models. PartMC has a modular, test-covered, pseudo-OOP, Fortran 90 codebase; several C and Fortran dependencies (SUNDIALS, MPI, netCDF, SuiteSparse, ...); and a bespoke config-file subsystem supporting nested files for variable-size input.</p>
<p>Developing PyPartMC, we aim to provide added value to both the existing community of PartMC users, accustomed to the Fortran/HPC ecosystem, as well as to a wider community potentially daunted by the entry threshold pertinent to the multiple steps needed to obtain, compile, setup and run PartMC, and analyse its output. Steps which so far involved usage of diverse tools and languages, and which are meant to be achievable in a single computational research environment such as Python, Julia or Matlab. </p>
<p>To this end, PyPartMC is available at pypi.org in form of both source (with all 10+ dependencies in git submodules) as well as binary packages (Linux, Windows and macOS). Binary packages have all the dependencies statically linked, what is orchestrated using CMake via standard wheel-building logic. The design features: (i) employment of unmodified Fortran code of the wrapped PartMC package; (ii) binding logic implemented in C++ using pybind11; (iii) garbage collection of Fortran derived type instances; (iv) a drop-in i/o layer replacement matching the Fortran config-file subsystem API, which C++ sees as nlohmann::json objects, and which quacks like ordinary dicts from Python perspective. On top of that, a thorough test coverage including Github-Actions-hooked checks for interoperability with Matlab's built-in Python bridge and with Julia (using PyCall.jl).</p>

HPC-oriented Large-scale Code Restructurings with Coccinelle,fosdem-2024-2554-hpc-oriented-large-scale-code-restructurings-with-coccinelle,"<p>Once a codebase gets large, refactoring for performance is difficult.
Challenges include:
 the sheer time to carry out a possibly complicated transformation globally;
 the risk of introducing defects;
 poor acceptance by collaborators or code owners (if doing the HPC-oriented update for others);
 coping with diverging 'performance' paradigms (different parallelism models, APIs for GPU, etc).
The Coccinelle code transformation system can express a vast range of refactorings for C/C++ codebases as so-called 'semantic patches', that is programs in a special 'transformation' language.
While 'semantic patches' are typically very short, they can radically transform arbitrary large codebases, thus coping with the above mentioned 'challenges'.
This talk introduces the usage concept and shows sound, self-contained examples of HPC-oriented refactorings, including latest and upcoming features.</p>"

"Automating Spark (and Pipeline) Upgrades While ""Testing"" in Production",fosdem-2024-1970-automating-spark-and-pipeline-upgrades-while-testing-in-production,"<p>With Spark 4 in the pipeline for this year, many of us are looking at what will be involved in upgrading to the latest and greatest Spark. This talk will look at the open-source tooling we use to automate upgrading thousands of our Spark pipelines (from Spark 2.X -&gt; 3.4) and how to we used a variation of the write-audit-publish technique to validate the new pipelines in production for pipelines that might have less testing than ideal.</p>
<p>Seeing is a pre-requisite to believing, so the talk will include a short demo showing how the spark-upgrade tool works on a demo pipeline complete with ""live"" validation.</p>
<p>In this talk, you will learn how to:
Upgrade your Spark pipelines without crying*
Validating Spark (and other similar) pipelines even when you don't trust the tests (by extending the write-audit-publish pattern) on top of Iceberg, Hudi, or Delta Lake.</p>

Semantically-driven data management solution for I/O intensive HPC workflows,fosdem-2024-1784-semantically-driven-data-management-solution-for-i-o-intensive-hpc-workflows,"<p>Semantically-driven data management is an approach that focuses on the meaning and context of the data, rather than simply storing it. The semantic information can be used to drive workflows. The storage and retrieval of data can be optimized and specialised based on data semantics for different workflows.</p>
<p>DASI (Data Access and Storage Interface) is a semantically-driven data store developed by ECMWF as part of the EuroHPC project IO-SEA. Based on the FDB object store library developed and in operational use at ECMWF, DASI manages data using its domain specific and scientifically meaningful metadata keys, and separates data management from the underlying backend storage technologies. This allows very fast and efficient algorithms to search for and retrieve data (based on its semantic meaning) from large datasets. DASI is modular and is compatible with multiple backends (e.g., POSIX, CEPH, DAOS) through a diverse API (Python, C++, C). We will explain the concept of semantic description of data and demonstrate DASI as a data management solution.</p>"

Kubernetes and HPC: Bare-metal bros,fosdem-2024-2590-kubernetes-and-hpc-bare-metal-bros,"<p>The high performance computing (HPC) community has an often tumultuous relationship with cloud, with advocates from both sides facing off in a West Side Story style fight. The costs, historical lack of focus on performance, and lack of transparency about supply of cloud resources is problematic. The lack of consistent, automated orchestration on HPC poses challenges for running complex emerging workflows. Cloud is growing rapidly and is projected to be the largest sector of computing by revenue 2025. Cloud's market-favored position makes it a primary source and beneficiary of innovations, allowing it to address limitations of HPC. HPC needs a strategy for integrating cloud technologies and collaborating with the cloud community. If our HPC community cannot successfully integrate cloud technologies and techniques we (and our science) will be left behind. </p>
<p>To establish this foundation the community must adopt a new strategy - converged computing, or creating environments and technologies that combine the best of both worlds. In this talk I will discuss our innovative work toward this goal – implementing HPC technologies inside of Kubernetes, the de-facto standard workload orchestration framework, and Kubernetes inside of HPC. I will provide a brief history of our early work, including improving the default Kubernetes scheduler by way of testing more sophisticated graph-based scheduling (a project called Fluence), and implementing the entirety of an HPC workload manager inside of Kubernetes (the Flux Operator). Finally, I present the ultimate turducken - allowing for running machine learning and HPC applications (including the Flux Operator itself) inside of Kubernetes, inside of Flux. With this approach, we imagine a collaborative future where HPC users can deploy workloads seamlessly across environments, and encounter equality of automation and performance.</p>"

From Virtualization Platform to Hybrid Cloud Solution: A Hands-On Account,fosdem-2024-3003-from-virtualization-platform-to-hybrid-cloud-solution-a-hands-on-account,"<p>As organizations increasingly shift towards hybrid cloud, many are expected to face the following challenge: how to migrate virtual workloads from traditional virtualization platforms, like vSphere, oVirt or OpenStack, to a hybrid cloud solution, like OpenShift? There are a variety of strategies and tools available for such a transition to choose from. In this session, we will see one of these strategies, in which workloads keep running in virtual machines alongside containers on top of OpenShift, based on our recent experience in migrating real-world virtual machines from Red Hat Virtualization (RHV) to OpenShift Virtualization using Migration Toolkit for Virtualization (MTV).</p>
<p>In mid-2023, our engineering team at Red Hat took the task of migrating all the virtual machines from an internal RHV environment to a new OCP deployment. Our RHV environment was in use for more than a decade, running hundreds of production VMs as well as VMs for development purposes. Given the nature of the workloads, it was impractical, and in some cases not even possible, to containerize the workloads. Therefore, we decided to go ahead and take MTV for a spin, and move the VMs to run on OpenShift using OpenShift Virtualization, with minimal changes to the workloads that run inside them.</p>
<p>At first glance, this kind of migration appears fairly straightforward, doesn't it? Especially considering we now have access to mature tools for VM migrations, like virt-v2v and ovirt-imageio, that are orchestrated by the Forklift/MTV operator. And specifically, when migrating from RHV to OpenShift Virtualization, the same virtualization stack is used on both ends. However, in reality, the migration process was more complex than anticipated, with quite a few factors to consider and operations that were needed to complement the functionality in Forklift.</p>
<p>This session presents tips and insights for migrations from legacy virtualization platforms to OpenShift, through our test case of transitioning from oVirt/RHV to OpenShift/OKD using Forklift/MTV. Without assuming prior knowledge of the platforms and tools discussed, we will cover the entire migration process using Forklift, and explain scripts we implemented and strategies we used for a smooth transition to OpenShift. Join us to learn from our journey, so by the end of this session you will have a clear understanding of the necessary steps to successfully execute your organization's transition projects.</p>"
Making VirtIO sing - implementing virtio-sound in rust-vmm project,fosdem-2024-1910-making-virtio-sing-implementing-virtio-sound-in-rust-vmm-project,"<p>In automotive, Android guests are currently used for deploying infotainment systems. To support Android as a guest, the Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM) requires a set of virtual hardware like sound, video and networking. In this context, VirtIO has spreaded as a standard interface for virtual devices. Having VirtIO for hardware allows Android to be deployed in different VMMs that support VirtIO like Crosvm or QEMU. This talk presents the current efforts to implement virtio-sound for infotainment systems in automotive. The implementation of virtio-sound can be split into two: the device or backend and the driver or the frontend. Generally speaking, the driver runs in the guest OS and it is not different from other sound drivers. The sound driver exposes an API to the user-application in guest and then communicates to the device to serve those requests like playing a sound or recording audio. The device usually runs in the host and processes the requests that come from the driver. There are different ways to implement the device, e.g., as a built-in device in QEMU, using vhost or vhost-user. In this talk, we talk about our decision to implement virtio-sound as an vhost-user device. In this case, the device runs in the host machine as a separate process independent of the QEMU process. This deployment has benefits like reducing the attack surface of QEMU and also enables more granularity in setting up rights for the device process. Our implementation is able to handle different audio backends by relying on a generic interface. Currently, we support the pipewire and Alsa as audio backends. During this presentation, we propose to share our journey in building the virtio-sound device, including improving its specification, fixing bugs in the virtio-sound driver, and building it as a rust-vmm project. We also plan to outline a roadmap for the future like adding support for other audio backends like Gstreamer.</p>"
OpenStack Cluster Installer (aka: OCI): the Debian way to manage your OpenStack deployments,fosdem-2024-1747-openstack-cluster-installer-aka-oci-the-debian-way-to-manage-your-openstack-deployments,"<p>OCI (OpenStack Cluster Installer) is a software to provision an OpenStack clusters automatically. This package installs a provisioning machine, which uses the below components:</p>
<ul>
<li>DHCP server (isc-dhcp-server)</li>
<li>PXE boot server (tftp-hpa)</li>
<li>web server (apache2)</li>
<li>puppet-master</li>
</ul>
<p>Once computers in the cluster boot for the first time, a Debian live system is served by OCI over PXE, to act as a discovery image. This live system then reports the hardware features back to OCI. Computers can then be installed with Debian from that live system, configured with a puppet-agent that will connect
to the puppet-master of OCI. After Debian is installed, the server reboots, and OpenStack services are provisioned, depending on the server role in the cluster.</p>
<p>OCI is fully packaged in Debian, including all of the Puppet modules. After installing the OCI package and its dependencies, no other artificat needs to be installed on your provisioning server, meaning that if a local debian mirror is available, the OpenStack cluster installation can be done completely
offline.
This presentation will introduce OpenStack Cluster Installer, and explain how it works, its general principle, and why it's a very good solution to manage your OpenStack deployment on Debian.</p>

Exercising QEMU generated ACPI/SMBIOS tables using Biosbits from within a guest VM.,fosdem-2024-2262-exercising-qemu-generated-acpi-smbios-tables-using-biosbits-from-within-a-guest-vm-,"<p>Biosbits is a software written by Josh Triplett that executes the bios components such as acpi/smbios tables directly from grub without an operating system involved in between. In QEMU, we never had the ability to directly execute and test ACPI/SMBIOS tables from within a running guest. This work adds the ability to test QEMU generated acpi tables using biosbits. We can add new tests incrementally.
For QEMU, we maintain a fork of bios bits in gitlab containing numerous fixes along with all the dependent submodules. Within the QEMU repo, we add new python based avocado tests for bits. Care has been taken so that an ACPI contributor can add new tests for bits without having to know too much about biosbits itself or even touching the biosbits repository.
This test framework is available from QEMU v7.2. The talk will give some details on the bios bits avocado tests, how to execute them, how to add new tests etc. It will discuss some of the challenges and limitations of this framework.</p>"
One SDN to connect them all,fosdem-2024-1708-one-sdn-to-connect-them-all,"<p>What if you need to connect your Kubernetes workloads to a physical network, or more than one network?  You can attach multiple network interfaces using Multus, but you'll need to specify every detail. </p>
<p>Virtualized workloads have extra requirements from the network, given their stateful nature. For instance, they require their IP addresses to be preserved during their life-cycle, and also during live migration. Currently, since the network does not provide these features, the network-admin must deploy and configure extra services in the network. </p>
<p>But, what if you had a SDN (software defined network) to take care of that, and while doing so abstract how to bridge hybrid infrastructure, from bare metal, to virtualized, to public cloud environments? </p>
<p>Join us to learn and understand how these features can be used to provide Kubernetes workloads access to physical networks (protected by network policies)  through a live demo.
The multi-network feature is paramount to delivering non-cloud deployments with enough flexibility for their use cases: connecting to the physical networks of their data-centers is extremely important, since some of their services are not deployed in Kubernetes. For security reasons, access to/from the workloads running in Kubernetes should be governed by network policies. OVN-K multi-networking also provides an opinionated network fabric that can automate what users previously had to specify in detail, simplifying configuration and cost of operation for cloud providers and admins.</p>
<p>While any pod will benefit from the above, KubeVirt workloads (VMs) will get more juice out of this SDN implementation. While the feature-set available today is good enough to allow users of traditional virtualization platforms to lift-and-shift their existing workloads into KubeVirt, the features in the pipeline are game changers: VM workloads requires things from the network a pod wouldn’t normally ask for, such as preserving the IP during its life cycle, and also during migration (so the established TCP connection can survive being moved to a different Kubernetes node). These features are a really good match for OVN-Kubernetes since OVN already provides some migration-centered improvements used on other platforms (i.e. Openstack) which can be re-used to provide seamless live-migration of the VM workloads.</p>"
Operating Kubernetes Across Hypervisors with Cluster API & GitOps,fosdem-2024-2129-operating-kubernetes-across-hypervisors-with-cluster-api-gitops,"<p>Do you struggle with managing Kubernetes across different hypervisors? How can you make sure things run smoothly no matter where your clusters are?</p>
<p>In this talk, we'll introduce you to Cluster API, a powerful tool designed to simplify the setup and management of Kubernetes across diverse environments. Through a live demo and a real-world example, we'll showcase how Cluster API, coupled with GitOps practices, maintains consistency, ensuring operational ease despite variations in underlying infrastructure. Our focus will be on demonstrating the creation of Kubernetes clusters using MicroVMs through Firecracker and then replicating the same process on KubeVirt. This approach will illustrate how clusters can potentially scale across hundreds of servers and on different hypervisors while keeping operations consistent.</p>"

#snapsafety: de-duplicating state across Virtual Machine clones,fosdem-2024-3021--snapsafety-de-duplicating-state-across-virtual-machine-clones,"<p>Virtual Machine snapshots intentionally duplicate the state of a running Virtual Machine, so that we can go back in time or spawn new, identical, VMs from it. However, snapshots capture state that is meant to be unique and/or secret, such as entropy seeds, UUIDs, network configuration etc.</p>
<p>Recently, Linux added support for Virtual Machine Generation ID to de-duplicate the state of its internal PRNG upon Virtual Machine clone events. However, other parts of the kernel and user-space components lack proper mechanisms for adjusting. This can lead to functional issues, e.g. two VMs in the same network with the same network configuration, as well as security concerns, e.g. two user-space CSPRNGs returning identical ""random"" streams of bits.</p>
<p>In this talk we will describe the snapshot safety problem and speak about existing mechanisms for tackling it and our efforts to extend those. Moreover, we will discuss why we believe that a solution to this problem calls for collaboration among the hypervisor, guest kernel and guest user-space. Finally, we will present our latest efforts for building mechanisms that allow tackling the issue end-to-end.</p>"
Pipewire audio backend in QEMU,fosdem-2024-1686-pipewire-audio-backend-in-qemu,"<p>One of the essential features of QEMU is its audio backend support, which enables virtual machines to communicate with the host system's audio devices. The Pipewire audio backend in QEMU provides a powerful and flexible solution for managing audio in virtual machines. In this presentation, we will discuss the Pipewire audio backend in QEMU. By understanding how Pipewire works and how to configure it in QEMU, users can improve the audio experience in their virtual machines.</p>

AI-Driven Observability and Operations in Cloud-Edge Systems,fosdem-2024-2794-ai-driven-observability-and-operations-in-cloud-edge-systems,"<p>Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations (AIOps) has emerged as a new model for automating and streamlining operating operational workflow in large-scale IT infrastructures using AI-supported methods and tools on different levels. AIOps platforms can collect and aggregate the increasing volumes of data generated by multiple IT infrastructure components, provide real-time monitoring and analysis of cloud and edge resources, detect significant events and patterns related to application performance and availability before they become critical, and even in some cases automatically resolve these issues without human intervention. </p>
<p>Based on these concepts, our presentation will introduce a new experimental AIOps framework developed in OpenNebula and its Prometheus integration for the evaluation of AI techniques in order to provide intelligent workload forecasting and infrastructure orchestration capabilities to automate and optimize the provisioning and deployment of geographically distributed edge/cloud infrastructures and applications. We will also present the results of the evaluation of AI-based time series forecasting techniques to predict the CPU usage of VMs, and optimization techniques for the placement of VMs on top of the physical infrastructure, based on CPU usage predictions.</p>"
Bare-Metal Networking For Everyone,fosdem-2024-1828-bare-metal-networking-for-everyone,"<p>Do you feel that networking can be overwhelming? You are not alone. Understanding container networking may feel like a superpower and Kubernetes on Bare Metal may sound like dark magic, but don’t get scared. We all know Bare Metal helps your AI/ML applications to run faster, but the learning curve can be steep.</p>
<p>Kubernetes manages host networking on the nodes it deploys. Isn’t it a chicken and egg situation? What exactly happens with the network traffic inside a Kubernetes cluster? Which host interfaces are used by Kubernetes? Where to look to troubleshoot network issues with your workload? Last but not least, how to make your network lightning fast?</p>
<p>In this session we will explain everything you need to understand how on-prem networking works. Loadbalancers, DNS, whatever you need. We will give you a simple way to deploy your workload, even on the most complex topologies.</p>
<p>To make it more entertaining, we will demo a cluster running on a platform that ultimately broke our understanding of what on-prem and what a cloud is, putting a question mark on some fundamental definitions. Join us and deploy your own bare metal cloud tomorrow.</p>"
Hybrid Orchestration with IBM Z,fosdem-2024-2096-hybrid-orchestration-with-ibm-z,"<p>There are multiple workloads running on x86, Power or Z, and even for Z workloads there are multiple technical implementations like z/VM, KVM, PR/SM(Processor Resource/System Manager) or even zCX (z/OS container extension) or event native z/OS.</p>

Instant Ramen: Quick and easy multi-cluster Kubernetes development on your laptop,fosdem-2024-3256-instant-ramen-quick-and-easy-multi-cluster-kubernetes-development-on-your-laptop,"<p>Kubernetes is increasingly being used for mission critical applications where uptime and data protection are of primary importance.  Virtual machines run alongside containers thanks to the KubeVirt project.  When disaster strikes one data center, you can recover by failing over to another data center.  The RamenDR project handles data protection and orchestrates disaster recovery flows for containers and VMs alike.  All of this is powered by open source projects and many contributors.  But how can you develop and test a complex software stack that is designed to run on multiple racks of hardware in a data center?</p>
<p>In this talk we introduce a virtual machine disaster recovery software stack that runs on three Kubernetes clusters.  We will demonstrate a disaster scenario using a tool, drenv, which can create a multi-cluster environment including Rook Ceph storage, KubeVirt, and RamenDR on your laptop with one simple command.

DIY Private Container Registry,fosdem-2024-2161-diy-private-container-registry,"<p>The increasing adoption of containerization and container orchestration has highlighted the need for secure and controlled distribution of container images. This talk will delve into the methods of distributing private container images and OCI artifacts, analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of various solutions, especially in contexts like software sales and custom builds for clients.</p>
<p>We will begin our discussion with hosted registries, highlighting their cost-effectiveness, ease of implementation, and low maintenance needs. Next, we will explore self-hosted solutions, which offer greater flexibility. Finally, we will examine the integration of an OCI-compatible registry with a custom authorization server. This setup allows the incorporation of complex business logic into authorization decisions, such as custom IAM and product subscriptions. While this adaptable and cost-efficient approach may involve custom development, we will provide a thorough analysis of its implications.</p>"
Forensic container checkpointing and analysis,fosdem-2024-1855-forensic-container-checkpointing-and-analysis,"<p>With the introduction of ""Forensic Container Checkpointing"" in Kubernetes 1.25 it is possible to checkpoint containers.

libamicontained: a low-level library for reasoning about resource restriction,fosdem-2024-3033-libamicontained-a-low-level-library-for-reasoning-about-resource-restriction,"<p>A common question language runtimes have is: how many resources do I have
access to? They want to know e.g. how many threads they can run in parallel for
their threadpool size, or the number of thread-local memory arenas, etc.</p>
<p>The kernel offers many endpoints to query this information. There is
/proc/cpuinfo, /proc/stat, sched_getaffinity(), sysinfo(), the cpuset cgroup
hierarchy's cpuset.cpus.effective, the isolcpus kernel command line parameter,
/sys/devices/system/cpu/online. Further, libcs offer divergent implementations
of sysconf(_SC_NPROCESORS_ONLIN). As a bonus, the kernel scheduler may be
configured to limit resources using cpu ""shares"" or cpu quotas, so a task may
be able to run on all cores, but have some kind of rate limit that is not
reflected in the physical cores the system is allowed to run on.</p>
<p>In this talk, we propose a new library ""libamicontained"" to offer one place to
consolidate the logic for the answer to this question. We propose a:</p>
<ul>
<li>C ABI exporting</li>
<li>statically linked</li>
<li>zero dependency</li>
</ul>
<p>library which is aware of all of these different runtime configurations and
answers questions about cpu counts etc. in accordingly reasonable ways.</p>
<p>Of course, the real challenge here is adoption. Ideally we can pitch such a
library as ""from the container people"", so it's an easier pitch to language
runtimes. We are here seeking feedback on all points (heuristics to reason
about CPU counts, design goals, etc.) from container people as a first step.</p>

Using chroots in a single Linux Container as an alternative to docker-compose,fosdem-2024-3063-using-chroots-in-a-single-linux-container-as-an-alternative-to-docker-compose,"<p>StartOS has devised a new strategy for supporting multiple rootfs images for a single application (e.g. nextcloud + postgres). We have elected to do so by creating a single LXC container for the application, that contains each rootfs image, and running each process in a chroot, using bind mounts for special directories such as <code>/proc</code>, <code>/dev</code>, <code>/sys</code>, and <code>/run</code>. This reduces the overhead of multiple containers, but could have drawbacks with respect to compatibility between processes from different distributions, and security within the application. As of the time of this talk, we will have tested an implementation of this strategy, and we will report our findings regarding its advantages and disadvantages.</p>"
Soft Reboot: keep your containers running while your image-based Linux host gets updated,fosdem-2024-3282-soft-reboot-keep-your-containers-running-while-your-image-based-linux-host-gets-updated,"<p>systemd v254 added soft-reboot, a reboot type that keeps the same kernel running, but restarts the whole of userspace into a new rootfs, while serializing state across (e.g.: File Descriptor Store). In v255 the ability for select system services/portable services/containers to survive the reboot uninterrupted was added. On an image-based Linux system this allows atomically updating the rootfs without causing interruptions for workloads that run on discrete and separate filesystem images. This talk will briefly explore this new feature, listing new improvements from the latest version, and showing a demo of a soft-reboot being applied on an Azure Boost machine with two surviving critical portable services running without interruptions while the rest of the OS is restarted.</p>
<p>We will explore what container runtimes maintainers would need to do in order to support this feature. systemd-portabled already supports it for Portable Services.</p>"
Juggling with UIDs and GIDs: rootless container deployment with Ansible,fosdem-2024-3412-juggling-with-uids-and-gids-rootless-container-deployment-with-ansible,"<p>This demo aims to share a convenient setup for maintaining a container environment using Podman and Ansible.
The configuration is well-suited for home server applications as it enables the user to efficiently manage media files and execute sysadmin tasks without requiring root access.
In particular, delegating the setup to a playbook that does not require root ensures that the system converges to the desired state without the need for a superuser.
This short talk focuses on a common scenario where a rootless setup may require remapping UIDs and GIDs, which can be quite challenging to maintain over time. Due to the nature of these use cases, Ansible is frequently one of the best options for setting up, updating, and keeping a system up and running over time. 
Finally, this presentation covers other common needs of a container setup, such as the need to store secrets, manage services separated into logical units, and reproduce the setup on different systems.</p>"

vscode-container-wasm: An Extension of VSCode on Browser for Running Containers Within Your Browser,fosdem-2024-3187-vscode-container-wasm-an-extension-of-vscode-on-browser-for-running-containers-within-your-browser,"<p>One of the limitations of on-browser VSCode is the lack of Linux-based terminals and containers running completely within the browser.</p>
<p>In this talk, Kohei will introduce an on-browser VSCode extension ""vscode-container-wasm"" which enables users to run Linux-based containers completely within the browser and interact with them via the terminals. This is implemented using ""container2wasm"" which is a container-to-wasm image converter that enables running Linux-based containers on Wasm runtimes and browsers, using Wasm-compiled CPU emulators (Bochs for x86_64 and TinyEMU for RISC-V). The talk will cover the overview of vscode-container-wasm and container2wasm, how they work, and their integration status with tools in the community.</p>"
Zero-touch Infrastructure for Container Applications,fosdem-2024-3220-zero-touch-infrastructure-for-container-applications,"<p>Container applications are deployed by creating an instance of a pre-defined container image from declaratively configured properties. This eases automation and reproducibility of deployments, which in turn reduces operational risk. </p>
<p>What if we extend these properties to node provisioning, treating the OS itself like a containerised app? What if, instead of making general purpose operating systems fit our needs we radically re-think our approach, from the ground up, on how an OS should handle and work in a cloud native environment? </p>
<p>Applying the same expectations we have towards handling of container applications we present an alternative approach to OS provisioning, configuration, and lifecycle management. Leveraging a strict separation of OS and applications, we show how a zero-touch, immutable, image-based OS can be built. And extending this concept, we make builds attestable and deployments cryptographically secure, thus helping to secure your infrastructure’s supply chain. In this talk we will cover some of the latest thinking in operating systems, going beyond the established concept of a Container Linux to a future based on the latest developments in systemd’s composable images and a generic model for image-based architectures.</p>"
Modern Build Systems for Containers,fosdem-2024-3398-modern-build-systems-for-containers,"<p>Are you still building images like it's 2015? This talk will get you up-to-speed with modern build technology and techniques and building images in seconds rather than minutes. This can make an enormous difference in CI/CD where a small improvement can reduce costs and speed up delivery.</p>
<p>We'll start by taking a look at what an OCI container image is, before delving into the different options for assembling them. After understanding why things are the way they are, we'll dive into some of the options for achieving vastly faster build times and smaller images. We'll also look at supply chain concerns such as SLSA, SBOMs and attestations.</p>
<p>We'll explore <a href=""https://github.com/moby/buildkit"">buildkit</a>, <a href=""https://buildpacks.io/"">buildpacks</a>, <a href=""https://github.com/dagger/dagger"">Dagger</a>, <a href=""https://ko.build/"">ko</a>, <a href=""https://github.com/chainguard-dev/apko"">Apko</a>, <a href=""https://github.com/canonical/rockcraft"">Rockcraft</a> and <a href=""https://nixos.org/"">Nix</a> amongst other technologies.</p>

From Containers to Unikernels: Navigating Integration Challenges in Cloud-Native Environments,fosdem-2024-3402-from-containers-to-unikernels-navigating-integration-challenges-in-cloud-native-environments,"<p>Containers have undoubtedly taken the lead in the landscape of cloud-native applications, but their security limitations have prompted a revisit to conventional VMs. This renewed interest revolves around implementing additional security measures, particularly by confining containers within VM or microVM sandboxes. While this approach offers enhanced security, it introduces complexities in effectively optimizing resources on physical nodes.</p>
<p>On the other hand, unikernels emerge as a compelling alternative —- a streamlined application kernel that preserves the benefits of VM isolation. However, the challenge lies in seamlessly integrating unikernels into the existing container ecosystem.</p>
<p>In this talk we present <code>urunc</code>, a CRI-compatible container runtime that spawns unikernels, packaged in OCI images. We dig in the internals of <code>urunc</code>, providing insights into support for various hypervisors, network and storage handling, as well as the integration with high-level orchestration frameworks (such as k8s). At the same time, we elaborate on the network setup implications when unikernels and generic containers are mixed in the context of k8s.</p>"
Bridging Research and Open Source: the genesis of Gephi Lite,fosdem-2024-3253-bridging-research-and-open-source-the-genesis-of-gephi-lite,"<p><a href=""https://gephi.org/gephi-lite/"">Gephi Lite</a>, developed by <a href=""https://ouestware.com"">OuestWare</a>, is a web-based, streamlined version of the renowned graph visualization tool, <a href=""https://gephi.org"">Gephi</a>. Aimed at porting its features into a web application while simplifying common use cases, this project was published in 2022 (<a href=""https://github.com/gephi/gephi-lite"">github.com/gephi/gephi-lite</a>).</p>
<p>The genesis of Gephi Lite is routed into academia. Over the last decade, a succession of graph visualisation and manipulation prototypes emerged, each addressing specific research requirements. These academic prototypes, funded by various research projects, paved the way for the development of increasingly powerful low-level tools (<a href=""https://sigmajs.org"">sigma.js</a>, <a href=""https://graphology.github.io/"">graphology</a>).</p>
<p>Gephi Lite emerges as the culmination of these efforts. This presentation explores the concise journey of how diverse research needs over the past 10 years converged into the development of Gephi Lite.</p>"
"Cosma, a visualization tool for network synthesis",fosdem-2024-3394-cosma-a-visualization-tool-for-network-synthesis,"<p><a href=""https://cosma.arthurperret.fr"">Cosma</a> is a visualization tool for knowledge workers. It helps create, use and share non-linear scientific documentation. It works by reading plain text files interconnected with [[wiki links]] and rendering them as an interactive network of index cards inside a standalone HTML file. This talk will present the design choices of Cosma, which uses existing ideas but in a peculiar way: it includes graph visualization but primarily for network synthesis rather than analysis; it creates contextualized backlinks based on wiki links but also based on citations (bibliographic references); it is a command-line program but most of its features are located within the files it exports. These choices reflect the core idea of the project (which is as much an ambition as it is a set of constraints): leveraging innovation from the “tools for thought” space (easy hypertext authoring, interactive publications) while addressing the needs of creative, investigative knowledge work (owning robust data, backing claims with sources).</p>"
From the lab to Jupyter : a brief history of computational notebooks from a STS perspective,fosdem-2024-3190-from-the-lab-to-jupyter-a-brief-history-of-computational-notebooks-from-a-sts-perspective,"<p>Scripts and softwares are indispensable components of contemporary research. While the study of scientific instruments has been extensively covered in science and technology studies (STS), as well as aspects related to digital data, software strangely remains absent. I will build on the success of Jupyter computational notebooks to sketch a social study of open source scientific softwares. </p>
<p>The Jupyter project, initiated in 2001 by a physics graduate student interested in scientific programming, has gradually evolved into a global data science infrastructure. I will demonstrate the importance of closely examining its trajectory by identifying the continually negotiated conditions for the transition from local usage to a role as a generic instrument, progressively leading to its integration into a diversity of services beyond scientific communities. The dissemination of computational notebooks has thus not only facilitated a convergence between open code and open science but also between the practices of researchers and those of computer developers, leading to the stabilization of a specific infrastructure for data analysis.</p>"
UB App: Using Design Justice to involve marginalised communities and urban planners in co-designing a new photovoice tool for citizen engagement,fosdem-2024-3496-ub-app-using-design-justice-to-involve-marginalised-communities-and-urban-planners-in-co-designing-a-new-photovoice-tool-for-citizen-engagement,"<p>How might we innovate digital tools for citizen engagement with visual methods to ‘retool’ citizen science and invite more people to document their lived experiences as inputs to urban planning and policy? And could we do so in a participatory process that uses principles of Data Feminism and Design Justice to diversify who has a seat at the table in the tool development, and whose interest are built into the tools we make? Forged in the fire of such burning questions, we present the UB App as an open-source photovoice application for smartphones, co-created during the Urban Belonging Project (2020-22) in a process that involved scholars from Copenhagen and Amsterdam, professional urban planners, citizen engagement experts, and seven marginalized communities in Copenhagen (deaf, lgbtq+, physically disabled, mentally vulnerable, houseless, internationals, and ethnic minorities). At the 2023 FOSDEM, we are excited introduce the UB App and the UB Toolkit, and use examples from  our design process to discuss the potentials and challenges of involving a multitude of voices and perspectives in the development of digital citizen science tools. We touch upon; how inputs from different stakeholders shaped decisions about what data collection the app makes possible; how it mitigates issues of privacy and visual and spatial literacy to make the app as inclusive as possible; and how design criteria were translated into app features that open new empirical opportunities for community engagement.</p>

From Grassroots to Standard Practice: how an Open Science society shaped university initiatives,fosdem-2024-3479-from-grassroots-to-standard-practice-how-an-open-science-society-shaped-university-initiatives,"<p>Join us for a journey through the inception, growth, and eventual challenges faced by the Reproducibility Society at the University of Surrey, a grassroots initiative that sparked a movement in open and reproducible science collaboration. Established in June 2019, the society brought together research students from diverse disciplines to foster discussions on transparent and rigorous research methods. Drawing inspiration from the UK Reproducibility Network and various postgraduate-led initiatives nationwide, the society successfully influenced university policy, creating a supportive community for skill-sharing, motivation, and resource exchange. An initially successful project central to the society was the Monthly Mini Hacks. These were workshops that addressed the coding learning curve and promoted collaboration among students and research staff. Using Open Science Framework and open access publishing platforms, we facilitated hands-on coding experiences where information was freely available to everyone.</p>
<p>This talk delves into the story of student collaboration, the highs and lows of open science advocacy, and the valuable lessons learned from the challenges encountered.
The Surrey Reproducibility Society experienced triumph, such as university-wide implementation of policies championed by the society, and failures, including the societies eventual dissolution. This talk reflects on the society’s journey, sharing tools for attendees to implement in their own initiatives, and learn from the success and struggle of our grassroots initiative. We explore the potential for future endeavours, emphasising the importance of adaptability, community engagement, and resilience in advancing the cause of open and reproducible science within the academic landscape. We intend for attendees to leave our talk wiser than we were, inspired to make positive change, and equipped with the tools to do so.</p>"

The book is a collaborative effort; over 470 contributors from many, diverse backgrounds share their wisdom in its pages.
The size of the community means that not everyone will share the same technical skills, preferred tools, or ways of working.
The book is built from Markdown source files using JupyterBook and work is largely coordinated on <a href=""https://github.com/the-turing-way"">GitHub</a>.
We want to maintain and promote the benefits of version control, plain text and open working.
However, this can clash with the experience and expectations of collaborators, raising the barrier to contribution and potentially making people feel unwelcome.
I will talk from my perspective as an RSE and co-lead of <em>The Turing Way's</em> infrastructure working group about lessons in bridging the knowledge of our community and the technology of how the book is produced.</p>"
The Carpentries Offline: Teaching Foundational Data Science and Coding Skills with Little or no Internet Access,fosdem-2024-3205-the-carpentries-offline-teaching-foundational-data-science-and-coding-skills-with-little-or-no-internet-access,"<p>The Carpentries teaches foundational coding and data science skills to researchers worldwide using open source training materials. A typical workshop uses several online components: a website with course notes, an etherpad for shared notes, data downloads, Github repositories and frequently a Jupyter notebook or Rstudio server. One of the popular lessons is HPC Carpentry which covers an introduction to the Unix command line and using shared High Performance Computing systems.</p>
<p>CarpentriesOffline (https://carpentriesoffline.org) is an out of the box solution for running a Carpentries workshop from a single device such as a Raspberry Pi, old laptop or even a dedicated server. It is intended for use in environments where there is limited or no internet access. Everything needed to run the workshop including course notes, data files, software downloads, a Git server, etherpad and a Jupyter Hub server are provided by the CarpentriesOffline system. It can also provide a backup environment for those with better connectivity in the event of the Carpentries website, etherpad, GitHub etc suffering an outage. </p>
<p>We have also developed a miniature high performance computing system based around the Raspberry Pi and RockPi single board computers to allow participants to experience using a high performance computing system without having remote access to one. </p>

Infra Finder: Increasing visibility of open technologies for open science,fosdem-2024-3436-infra-finder-increasing-visibility-of-open-technologies-for-open-science,"<p>Infra Finder is a new tool for advocates, decision-makers, and creators in the open infrastructure space. It is open-source and free to use. In this first release in January 2024, Infra Finder contains a standard set of information about 56 open infrastructure tools and services enabling the sharing of research data and publications that audiences can use to identify services, increase adoption, and foster development and investment in open infrastructure. </p>
<p>At Invest in Open Infrastructure (IOI, https://investinopen.org/), we are committed to iteratively developing Infra Finder with the community. In the past months, through user interviews, focus groups, and testing, we acquired a better understanding of libraries’ and institutions’ infrastructure discovery and evaluation processes. We refined our interface design and data collection and validation workflows to be able to provide up-to-date, validated information in one place, and offer at-a-glance comparison views, with links to more granular information, thereby saving librarians time and effort in looking for scattered pieces of information to discover and evaluate what’s on offer. (More in our latest blog post: https://investinopen.org/blog/blog-introducing-infra-finder/)</p>
<p>With this first release, we are collecting feedback and use cases for this first set of services in Infra Finder in order to further develop the information resource and the set of services covered in the tool. In this session, we will demonstrate Infra Finder. We will also share information about expressing interest in adding your tool to Infra Finder, and invitations for audience feedback and suggestions on the current iteration as we develop our next steps for expansion of the tool.</p>"
Best practices for research in open source ecosystems,fosdem-2024-2405-best-practices-for-research-in-open-source-ecosystems,"<p>Much of the existing research about open source elects to study software repositories instead of ecosystems. An open source repository most often refers to the artifacts recorded in a version control system and occasionally includes interactions around the repository itself. An open source ecosystem refers to a collection of repositories, the community, their interactions, incentives, behavioral norms, and culture. The decentralized nature of open source makes holistic analysis of the ecosystem an arduous task, with communities and identities intersecting in organic and evolving ways. Despite these complexities, the increased scrutiny on software security and supply chains makes it of the utmost importance to take an ecosystem-based approach when performing research about open source. This talk provides guidelines and best practices for research using data collected from open source ecosystems, encouraging research teams to work with communities in respectful ways.</p>"

Detecting Propaganda on Facebook and Instagram Ads using Meta API,fosdem-2024-3204-detecting-propaganda-on-facebook-and-instagram-ads-using-meta-api,"<p>In the aftermath of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, Meta has taken steps to enhance transparency within its advertising network, notably through the <em>Ads Library</em> web portal and the API endpoint <em>Ads Archive</em>. Despite these initiatives, and potentially due to underutilization by the public and journalists, instances of exploitation endure on Facebook and Instagram. A recent illustration of this is the extensive RRN operation in 2023, involving hundreds of thousands of fake pages and advertisements <a href=""https://www.sgdsn.gouv.fr/files/files/20230719_NP_VIGINUM_RAPPORT-CAMPAGNE-RRN_EN1.pdf"">1</a> <a href=""https://www.reset.tech/documents/24102023_Networks-of-Facebook-Fake-Advertisers_Reset.pdf"">2</a>.</p>
<p>This presentation aims to offer practical insights into navigating the API, highlighting current limitations and proposing effective workarounds. A key focus will be on Facebook’s categorization of “Social Issues, Elections or Politics.” Indeed, applying this label to an ad has two consequences : (1) heightened scrutiny by Meta moderation and (2) increased public accessibility to data such as cost and targeted audience. Deliberate mislabeling then becomes a standard modus operandi in foreign information manipulation and interference. This presentation will detail ongoing efforts to detect and quantify the prevalence of mislabeled ads using open semantic and network analysis libraries.</p>"

Node Reduction through Artificial Intelligence Inferences using Graphology and SigmaJS: A Case Study on Hypertextual Conversations in Freight Train Graffiti in the North American Region.,fosdem-2024-3152-node-reduction-through-artificial-intelligence-inferences-using-graphology-and-sigmajs-a-case-study-on-hypertextual-conversations-in-freight-train-graffiti-in-the-north-american-region-,"<p>Embark on a journey into the intricacies of social sciences research, exploring the fusion of different platforms for a single project. Drawing from my hands-on experience in my Communication studies master's thesis, ""Visualization of a hypertextual interaction field in the form of a network using computational processes. Case study: Graffiti on freight trains in North America"", this presentation shares the challenges faced by social science students in developing robust programming projects without prior tech expertise.</p>
<p>It underscores the pivotal role of open source tools, and community, in overcoming these challenges, shedding light on the logical links facilitated by adaptable programming projects. This allows the integration between platforms and the possibility of creating logical connections between data and theoretical-methodological aspirations.</p>
<p>The synergy of spaCy, TensorFlow, Instagrapi, Graphology, and SigmaJS exemplifies the potential of open-source software. The presentation explores intricate adjustments made to spaCy, such as hashtag neutralization and graffiti entity identification without Named Entity Recognition (NER). It also examines the significance of custom object detection models in TensorFlow. The talk emphasizes the decision-making flexibility within Graphology/SigmaJS for network construction and visualization, with a focus on ""reduction by inference"" as a clear outcome resulting from the amalgamation of theoretical perspectives and different programming libraries or platforms.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the interplay between TensorFlow or spaCy, model inference in Python, the role of SQL as a link between platforms, and network formation with PHP to Graphology syntax, culminating in visualization with SigmaJS in JavaScript, underscores the significance of open-source tools. ""Reduction by inference"" emerges as a crucial aspect for identifying symbolic elements in social phenomena, exemplified by graffiti on freight trains. This achievement is made possible only through open-source tools and their potential for linkage through ""data"".</p>"
Workflow managers in high-energy physics: enhancing analyses with Snakemake,fosdem-2024-3415-workflow-managers-in-high-energy-physics-enhancing-analyses-with-snakemake,"<p>Workflow management tools have long been used in scientific computing to organise and operate workflows.

<p>Analyses in HEP typically consist of many non-trivially related processes with widely varying requirements. Workflow managers can vastly simplify such analyses, providing user-friendly methods to define, review and run analysis workflows. Snakemake has emerged as a leading workflow manager for HEP, with an established user base spread across major experiments. Dialogue between developers and HEP has led to integrations for distributed storage/transfer frameworks, e.g., <a href=""https://xrootd.slac.stanford.edu"">XRootD</a>, FTP and Amazon S3, and scheduling frameworks, e.g., <a href=""https://htcondor.org"">HTCondor</a>, <a href=""https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html"">Slurm</a>, and <a href=""https://www.drmaa.org"">DRMAA</a>. These integrations enable analysts to better leverage the distributed computing resources made available by experiments, significantly improving the efficiency of HEP analyses. Further collaboration between analysts and developers has seen Snakemake form the core of several standardised analysis frameworks aimed at improving analysis reproducibility such as <a href=""https://reanahub.io"">REANA</a>.</p>
<p>This contribution discusses the current use of workflow managers in HEP, including best practices for their application. Additionally, the anticipated requirements of analysts are considered within the context of ever-increasing data scales in HEP.</p>"
Open Neuroscience: practical suggestions for conducting open neuroscience research,fosdem-2024-2223-open-neuroscience-practical-suggestions-for-conducting-open-neuroscience-research,"<p>When I approach the intersection between neuroscience and Open Research, I am often met with a guiding principle summarised by the statement ""as open as possible, as closed as necessary"". Yet, a pithy phrase rarely delivers practical suggestions to champion Open Research in the day-to-day tasks of a computational neuroscientist. This talk goes beyond one-liners, and shares open science tools to facilitate neuroimaging research at every stage of the research process and its dissemination. The talk will conclude by noting areas in need of development, and early initiatives working to address them. Neuroscience research is relevant to everyone - we all have brains, and a better understanding of how they work enables a healthier future for us all. Thus, while the content of this talk focuses on neuroscience, the principles of open research that structure the content are of interest across disciplines and industries.</p>"
MiniMill: a miniature Field Mill Electrometer for airborne platforms,fosdem-2024-3323-minimill-a-miniature-field-mill-electrometer-for-airborne-platforms,"<p>A robust, miniaturized and open-source version of an electrostatic fieldmeter sensor, the <strong>MiniMill</strong>, is presented. The sensor is designed for a fast-response detection of the atmospheric electric field strength, an intrinsic parameter of the Global Electric Circuit (GEC) that electrically links the Earth’s surface to the upper levels of the atmosphere. Such a field varies greatly with the various weather conditions due to the re-distribution of charged or uncharged aerosols and terrestrial radioactive particles. Field mill electrometers have been consecutively used for ground-based measurements of such fields under diverse conditions, but sparse iterations of the sensor exist that can be tethered to airborne measurement platforms. The lightweight, disposable and easily reproducible design of the MiniMill allows the use on agile platforms, such as weather balloons, UAVs or even campaign aircrafts, and achieves a measurement accuracy of a few V m-1 on DC fields. 
MiniMill performance has been tested in vertical profiling measurements during scientific experiments in 2019 and 2022, where sensor “constellations” were launched on-board meteorological radiosondes under both fair weather conditions and large tropospheric dust events originating from the Sahara Desert. The sensor’s response exhibits a clear influence to the vertical large scale electric field when charged dust particles are present in the atmospheric circulation, which is a significant research achievement.
Also, we would like to share the inherent challenges of such a sensor (or, you know, lots of sensors) implemented entirely within the academic and research community. Let's brainstorm ways to make these sensors even more awesome together!</p>"

Improving IPv6-only experience on Linux,fosdem-2024-1798-improving-ipv6-only-experience-on-linux,"<p>IPv6-only networks are slowly becoming reality and are very well supported by mobile operating systems as well as macOS. Linux is slightly falling behind. In this talk, I will cover how IPv6-only and IPv6-mostly networks work and what needs to be done to have first class support in Linux.
Let's talk about IPv6-mostly networks - the kind of networks which run IPv6-only for devices supporting it while providing some IPv4 for devices dependent on it. This can be done by DHCPv4 option called <em><a href=""https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8925.html"">IPv6-only Preferred</a></em>. Using this option, a device can opt-out from IPv4 if it does not need it for proper functionality.</p>
<p>But even if a device opts out from IPv4, chances are it would need some IPv4-as-a-service for supporting legacy applications. Typically, <a href=""https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6877.html"">464XLAT</a> concept is used. This relies on a client-side translator (CLAT) responsible for converting residual IPv4 into IPv6. If such a translator is missing, which is the case for the most Linux desktop distributions nowadays, most things would work normally, but chances are you will hit some corner case where your computer complains about no connectivity.
There are solutions to set up CLAT on Linux but none of them is mature enough. Let's talk about what needs to be done to change this.</p>

Load balancing using XDP,fosdem-2024-3101-load-balancing-using-xdp,"<p>eBPF permits to run sandboxed programs in the OS kernel, mainly event-driven.
It's used to extend the kernel without recompiling it or use modules.
eXpress Data Path (XDP) provides a eBPF-based, high performance, programmable network data path in the Linux kernel.
It provides bare metal packet processing at the lowest point in the software stack, which makes it ideal for speed.
A XDP program returns an action code to tell the kernel what to do with the packet: XDP_PASS, XDP_DROP (and XDP_ABORTED), XDP_TX (and XDP_REDIRECT).</p>
<p>This talk, after a brief introduction of what XDP is, presents how redirecting packets, using the XDP_TX return code, can be used to implement a load balancer.
It shows how using Direct Server Return can increase the throughput and how to use a consistent hashing algorithm to redirect all the packets of a specific connection to the same backend server.
Finally, it explores how the load balancer can be deployed directly to backend servers without the need for a dedicated machine, leveraging the Equal-Cost Multi-Path routing.
The presentation of a possible network topology to deploy this load balancer using BPG or static routes completes the seminar.</p>"

Network Topology Discovery: how it really works,fosdem-2024-1748-network-topology-discovery-how-it-really-works,"<p>Feel like you’re not quite sure you know about all the devices in your network? This is when network topology discovery function comes in very handy. Although, applying it might not be that straightforward if you don’t know what it consists of and how to do it.<br />
This presentation outlines the network topology discovery in detail, told by the monitoring platform’s NetXMS (netxms.com) developers team with decades of experience. They will cover such topics as 
- what is LLDP and CDP and how they can be used as sources of info for the topology discovery
- how Spanning Tree can be such a source too (or not at all!)
- what is FDB and how it can be used to get information about the end nodes in your network
- automatic device discovery</p>
<p>Finally, the NetXMS team will guide you through the network preparation guidelines, using the NetXMS use case and their hands-on experience to show you the A to Z setup process. There are many ways where you can go wrong in this process, so the team will cover also most popular pitfalls. Please, do come if your areas of interest are network monitoring, administration and architecture, if you’d like to be more efficient in your network audit — and, generally, if you are up for a great 40 minutes spent!

"ipt_geofence: Protecting Networks using GeoFencing, Blocklists and Service Analysis",fosdem-2024-3328-iptgeofence-protecting-networks-using-geofencing-blocklists-and-service-analysis,"<p>Cybersecurity attacks are constantly increasing and simple IP/port-based policies are no longer enough. GeoIP is a popular technique used to limit access to selected resources from specific locations, and IP blocklists contain lists of IP addresses that have a low reputation and for which communications (from/to) should be forbidden on healthy networks. In addition to this, IP addresses that have shown malicious behaviour (e.g. multiple service failures or WordPress attack attempts) should also be blocked.</p>
<p>This talk introduces ipt_geofence, an open-source tool for Linux and FreeBSD that combines in one tool IP geofencing, service (e.g. SSH, Web and mail) analysis, and blocklists. It allows malicious hosts to be blocked and hence protect services in a simple way without having to use multiple tools and complex administration practices to implement what ipt_geofence offers out of the box.</p>"

Testing iptables firewall rules with scapy,fosdem-2024-2812-testing-iptables-firewall-rules-with-scapy,"<p>The challenge we were facing was to verify a firewall based on iptables according to a set of defined requirements. Included in the challenge were finding a tool to craft custom network packets, integrating the tool into the test environment and defining test cases based on the expected communication behaviors and the given firewall rules. For this it is important to know how the packet filtering in the Linux kernel is working in general. This talk will highlight how the scapy python framework works in general and how it can be used to empower developers for testing to achieve this challenge.</p>
<p>This talk will start with an overview about the existing network packet tools and why scapy was chosen. Next it is important to understand the basics of the netfiler in the Linux kernel and how scapy is attached to it.
Once a functional overview of scapy is given, we are able to write proper test cases. We will explain detailed  examples how to create ICMP, UDP and TCP packets, how to manipulate the protocol header and how to choose fitting methods for sending in specific test scenarios. To wrap this up we will provide advanced real world examples based on specific iptables firewall rules.</p>"

Orchestrating Change: Automating GÉANT Network Migration,fosdem-2024-2306-orchestrating-change-automating-gant-network-migration,"<p>In June 2023, GÉANT announced the successful procurement of a new IP/MPLS layer for a next-generation network and the plan to automate the entire migration process using WorkflowOrchestrator (https://workfloworchestrator.org/) and Ansible with the aim to make the process quicker and at the same time more reliable and predictable. </p>
<p>This means orchestrated service management with minimal interaction needed from the operator: no more CLI to configure network devices, all OSS and BSS systems synchronised and a flexible service modelling that accommodates the customizations and optimizations needed in a R&amp;E environment. The adoption of a different vendor, NOKIA in our case, poses significant challenges both in terms of low-level mechanics as well as in terms of service modelling and decomposition.    </p>
<p>Now, we are sharing the results of this effort that has involved all the levels and parts of the organisation, profoundly changing our way of working. 
We are sure that a view into our current progress - especially considering the multi-vendor environment that we manage - will be valuable for anyone involved in the implementation and maintenance of IP networks in the community.</p>
<p>Particular attention will be reserved to the differences between orchestration and automation, how these two topics intersect with each other in managing complex environments and how much the mindset changes in terms of design and implementation process.</p>
<p>GAP - GÉANT Automation Platform - which now manages the new GÉANT network, is entirely based on open-source software and more specifically on the Workflow Orchestrator (created by SURF and ESnet): high-quality software written within the R&amp;E community that works as a framework to orchestrate networks of whatever complexity and scale. GÉANT is contributing to and sustaining it to lower the barrier to adoption so that other organisations can benefit from it and join the initiative. </p>
<p>The other cornerstone of the platform, Ansible, is an open source automation framework with a vibrant community. While not initially created for network devices, Ansible fulfils all our needs and keeps the curve of adoption low. We are eager to share how we used and misused it to achieve our needs in terms of separation between data, design and operations.</p>"
Flying higher: hardware offloading with BIRD,fosdem-2024-3337-flying-higher-hardware-offloading-with-bird,"<h2>Offload IP forwarding to a SmartNIC/DPU with <code>tc-flower(8)</code></h2>

ZeekJS: JavaScript support in Zeek,fosdem-2024-2388-zeekjs-javascript-support-in-zeek,"<p><a href=""https://zeek.org/"">Zeek</a> (formerly Bro) is an extensible and scriptable Network Security Monitor. For decades, it has provided its own custom scripting language as the primary way for users to handle low-level network protocol events. With the release of Zeek 6.0, support for <a href=""https://community.zeek.org/t/a-first-look-at-zeek-s-new-javascript-support/7188"">JavaScript as an alternative scripting language</a> has been added by embedding Node.js via the <a href=""https://github.com/corelight/zeekjs"">ZeekJS plugin</a>.</p>
<p>```
$ cat hello.js
zeek.on('zeek_init', () =&gt; {
  console.log('Hello, Zeek!');
});</p>
<p>$ zeek ./hello.js
Hello, Zeek!
```</p>
<p>This talk will give a short Zeek introduction followed by a technical overview of how JavaScript support in Zeek was realized as an external plugin and demonstrate use-case examples. There will be details about Zeek's plugin architecture, its IO loop concepts and ways to interact with the Zeek script interpreter. Each of these enabled an almost seamless way to load <code>.js</code> script files, adding Node.js's libuv IO loop as another IO source into Zeek's main loop, as well as patching in JavaScript functions as Zeek event and hook handlers. Astonishingly, no modifications to Zeek's core were needed to pull this off.</p>
<p>One area this feature opens up is Zeek interacting with external systems by using Node.js builtin functionality or off-the-shelf libraries through npm - something where the Zeek scripting language ecosystem pales in comparison or quickly requires a C++ implementation. Concrete examples are sending HTTP requests in reaction to certain events, rapid log exporter prototyping (Redis, ZeroMQ), or serving HTTP APIs directly from within Zeek.</p>"
k8gb meets Cluster API,fosdem-2024-1793-k8gb-meets-cluster-api,"<p>k8gb is a Kubernetes native load balancing solution that enables arbitrary workloads to run in a disaster recovery mode as well as in the round robin fashion. It assumes geographically dispersed availability zones aka failure domains.</p>
<p>Luckily, there is another open-source standard that can help with setting up such Kuberneres clusters. Cluster API is a standard that unifies Kubernetes cluster lifecycle and day-2 operations across multiple cloud providers.</p>
<p>In this talk we will be talking about an open-source way to fully automated K8s clusters that can host workloads that can survive any failure, using pure DNS as the underlying tool for switching the communication among available Kubernetes clusters. No single vendor lock-in. Workloads can be deployed in AWS, Azure, GCP, on-prem. The only common denominators are Kubernetes and Cluster-API.
k8gb</p>
<hr />
<p>k8gb is DNS based global service load balancer that can interconnect multiple Kubernetes clusters into one resilient system. Join this talk to learn how it can handle a failover scenario when pods in one cluster go down and second cluster in different location saves the day.</p>
<p>k8gb is an open-source Kubernetes operator that is deployed in each participating cluster. It is comprised of CoreDNS, ExternalDNS and the k8gb controller itself. Using ExternalDNS it can create a zone delegation on a common cloud DNS server like Route53 or Infoblox so that the embedded CoreDNS servers work as an authoritative DNS. K8gb controller makes sure these CoreDNS servers are updated accordingly based on the readiness probes of the application.</p>
<p>In this sense this solution is unique, because it is using Kubernetes native tools with customisable probes and battle tested DNS protocol instead of HTTP pings or other similar approaches where single point of failure might be a problem. In k8gb architecture all k8s clusters are equal and there is no SPoF except the common edge DNS server.</p>
<h2>Cluster API</h2>
<p>Cluster API is an umbrella standard for multiple cloud providers that can easily create new clusters using Kubernetes patterns such as controllers and custom resources. Together with k8gb it provides very nice synergy to the k8s ecosystem and also enables deploying stuff into those newly created clusters because of its hierarchical nature (parent as a management cluster &amp; child as the workload cluster). </p>
<p>So at the end of day we have two paradigms - k8gb representing the p2p decentralized solution while Cluster API representing the centralized architecture with single management cluster (SPoF). Believe it or not but these two above-mentioned paradigms complete each other and work together in synergy.</p>
<p>Come to this talk and you will learn more about this setup.</p>"

Mutli-network in Kubernetes: No batteries included,fosdem-2024-1944-mutli-network-in-kubernetes-no-batteries-included,"<p>Kubernetes has historically taken a very hands-off approach to the multi-network topic. If you’re a telecom and network jockey you know the problem: Without it, pods only have one interface. When it came to solving this in Kubernetes, rather than tackling the problem, it was left for the ecosystem to solve. Thus, projects like Multus CNI, CNI Genie and DANM came to be: they solved a community problem (“I want more than one interface in my pod!”) outside Kubernetes, following its API extension philosophy.</p>
<p>Fast forward a bunch of years: there’s a new KEP to provide an in-tree solution to multi-networking, which will allow people to express in a Kubernetes native way that their pods require more than one network. </p>
<p>We’re going to look at the problem from two perspectives, first a political one: What’s the community experience with working with the Kubernetes community and what kind of challenges have we faced over the years? We’ll share our stories of successes and, yes, of the failures. But because there’s only so much politics you can stomach, we’ll also look at it from the other end of the spectrum – the hands-on-a-terminal-perspective, looking directly at an implementation.</p>
<p>Together we’ll explore architecture and API changes for Pod interfaces as Kubernetes elements, along with a prototype implementation … in Multus CNI of all things. We invite you to participate in unifying advanced networking technology in Kubernetes.</p>"
Declarative Networking in Declarative World,fosdem-2024-1659-declarative-networking-in-declarative-world,"<p>Since the beginning of time, declarative APIs have been driving everything that can happen inside a Kubernetes cluster. Predefined CRDs, operators defining custom CRDs, everything is about declarative APIs. Write your YAML once, deploy it, forget it. That’s how you create a cluster, that’s how you deploy your workload.</p>
<p>But is it, for real, as simple as it sounds? How do you bring declarativeness to the imperative world? In the current state of things, host networking is one huge imperative nightmare. So how to happily marry an old-school Network Manager and brand new Kubernetes API? In this session we will demonstrate how NMState provides you with a Declarative Network API, finally allowing you to manage host networking in a declarative manner.</p>
<p>To make it more entertaining, we will show you how the Kubernetes cluster with NMState Operator manages networking on the nodes it deploys. It may sound like a chicken and egg situation, but trust us, it is not. Last but not least, we show how it protects itself from applying destructive network changes potentially taking your cluster down.</p>

"Navigating the Networking Maze of Kubernetes: A Journey of Discovery, Confusion, and (Hopefully) Enlightenment",fosdem-2024-2359-navigating-the-networking-maze-of-kubernetes-a-journey-of-discovery-confusion-and-hopefully-enlightenment,"<p><a href=""https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes"">Kubernetes</a> networking is often perceived as a labyrinth, where pods, services, and ingresses exchange data packets. While Container Network Interfaces (CNIs) undoubtedly play a pivotal role, the networking landscape extends far beyond these plugins.</p>
<p>We'll embark on a journey beyond the confines of CNI, exploring the realm of the kube-apiserver, the central control plane that orchestrates the entire Kubernetes ecosystem. We'll uncover the secrets of the kubelet, the node agent that receives instructions from the kube-apiserver and is responsible for managing the lifecycle of pods and containers on that node.</p>

Packet Where aRe You - An eBPF based tool for diagnosing Linux networking,fosdem-2024-2364-packet-where-are-you-an-ebpf-based-tool-for-diagnosing-linux-networking,"<p>Software is eating the world, and networking is no exception.  Gone are the days when there was a distinct boundary between the application servers and the networking connecting them together. In the cloud native era that we live in, much of traditional networking between applications ends up being defined entirely within the Linux kernel networking stack, sometimes enhanced by eBPF programs, to provide highly scalable and efficient connectivity between Linux containers.  When network packets go missing, its no longer sufficient to capture packets with tcpdump, or trace the path through the Linux firewall rules. You may have to look deeper into the Linux kernel's networking subsystem and trace the packet flow through each of the kernel networking functions watching for packet filtering or modifications. </p>
<p>Cilium's Packet Where aRe You (PWRU) was purpose built to help discover problems deep in the Linux kernel's network subsystem. It is a great diagnostic tool to reach for when you've ruled out DNS or an obvious firewall rule blunder.  In this talk I'll review how PWRU works, and walk through a few usage examples.</p>"

An in-depth look at JFR in GraalVM and how it compares to JFR in OpenJDK,fosdem-2024-2491-an-in-depth-look-at-jfr-in-graalvm-and-how-it-compares-to-jfr-in-openjdk,"<p>GraalVM Native Image is a technology that allows users to transform their Java programs into ahead-of-time compiled executables. However, until recently, Native Image was missing a key tool that Java developers use to gain insight into what an application is doing: JDK Flight Recorder. JFR has been re-implemented in Native Image so that it can be included with executables and behave with a similar experience to JFR in OpenJDK. In this presentation, we'll peel back the layers and give you a tour of some of the most vital parts of JFR's inner workings in Native Image.  At various points, we'll stop and draw comparisons to how JFR is implemented in OpenJDK.</p>
<p>From this presentation, listeners will get exposure to some of the unique challenges to developing low-level implementations for Java-on-Java and ahead-of-time compiled applications. They will also gain a better understanding of how key JFR components work under-the-hood.</p>"
Foreign Function & Memory API,fosdem-2024-1714-foreign-function-memory-api,"<p>The Java platform has always provided a rich set of libraries to allow developers to reach beyond the boundaries of the JVM, from databases (JDBC) to web services (HTTP client). Unfortunately, accessing foreign memory (i.e. memory not managed by the JVM) and invoking foreign functions (i.e. code outside the JVM) in Java is still significantly harder than it should be.</p>
<p>The Foreign Function &amp; Memory Access API (FFM API in short) is a new API in Java SE 22 which aims at reducing the impedance mismatch between Java applications and native libraries in three steps.</p>
<p>First, the FFM API provides a rich API to model a region of off-heap memory as a memory segment. The contents of memory segments can be described using memory layouts, and accessed using var handles. Moreover, the lifetime of memory segments is managed explicitly, and safely, thus reducing the risk of use-after-free bugs.</p>
<p>Second, the FFM API provides a rich API to describe and link native functions. Once linked, such functions can then be invoked, using method handles. The dual - turning Java methods into function pointers - is also possible, thus achieving full bi-directional interoperability between Java and native code.</p>
<p>Third, thanks to the compositional nature of the FFM API, access to native libraries can be simplified even further with the use of a tool (jextract) which mechanically generates the FFM API artifacts needed to access said libraries.</p>
<p>Designing a complex API such as the FFM API poses some unique design and implementation challenges: how does a Java program reason about the lifetime of a region of memory outside the boundaries of the Java heap? How can it describe the signature of foreign functions? And, what new risks does the FFM API pose to the integrity of the Java platform as a whole? Resolving such challenges requires a careful balancing act, where access to low-level features is realized in ways that are consistent with the evolution and the core principles of the Java platform.</p>"

The Challenges of Running the Fuzion Language Natively on the OpenJDK,fosdem-2024-2110-the-challenges-of-running-the-fuzion-language-natively-on-the-openjdk,"<p>The Fuzion language is a hybrid functional and object-oriented language that in many respects behaves exactly diametrical to Java.  Nevertheless, the JVM has turned out an excellent target platform for Fuzion and in this talk I will present why that is the case and what challenges had to be overcome.</p>
<p>Fuzion uses algebraic types, i.e., product types and tagged union types.  All types can be parametric, but unlike Java not using type-erasure but monomorphisation.</p>
<p>Unlike Java, where user defined types have reference semantics, Fuzion has value semantics by default, reference semantics only for types that are explicitly declared so.</p>
<p>I will present how these are implemented in the new JVM byte-code back-end and what trade-offs and optimizations are made. In particular, I will</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>present several levels of optimizations for tagged union types when mapped to efficient to byte-code</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>show how product type with value semantics are implemented, where the JIT compiler creates surprisingly efficient code and how we all could profit form project valhalla</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>explain how type parameters (generics) are implemented using monomorphisation including support for basic types as type parameters and what benefits this brings.</p>

A beginner's guide to Backports,fosdem-2024-2460-a-beginner-s-guide-to-backports,"<p>""Backporting"" is the process by which fixes from the coal-face of OpenJDK development are adapted and applied to earlier versions. Most backports are managed via the JDK Updates Project (JDK8u is an exception). Backporting is perhaps underappreciated, but it can be challenging, stimulating and fun, and is one option for anyone who is interested in getting started with OpenJDK development.</p>
<p>This talk is a gentle introduction to getting started with backports. We will cover identifying, filtering and ranking candidate bugs, the Backports process (or processes) involved, tools, tips, case studies, caveats and tricks to keep backporting effective and fun.</p>

They serialize a warmed-up Java application to disk and allow users to quickly resume their application from that specific state at a later point in time. The smaller the serialized JVM/application image is, the faster it can be restored or transferred to a remote location.</p>
<p>This talk is about minimizing the memory footprint of the JVM before a snapshot/checkpoint.

Java… to unlock GPU acceleration for Polyglot Language Runtimes,fosdem-2024-3085-java-to-unlock-gpu-acceleration-for-polyglot-language-runtimes,"<p>Polyglot programming has been re-ignited by the Truffle Language Implementation Framework to enable the interoperability of Java with other programming languages, such as Python, JavaScript, Ruby, etc. A polyglot runtime system that can interoperate with multiple programming languages can increase not only maintainability but also the performance of the underlying runtime.</p>
<p>This talk aims to showcase the interoperability of Java with Python via polyglot programming. Additionally, it aims to go one step ahead, and explain how TornadoVM - an open-source software technology for boosting the performance of Java programs - can be used as leverage to deliver hardware acceleration in various other polyglot language runtimes. In particular, this talk will show how developers can build high-performance libraries (e.g., a k-means implementation, matrix vector multiplication, etc.) in Java with TornadoVM, and exploit them from other programming languages, such as Python, JavaScript, Ruby, etc.</p>"
The JVM vs. WebAssembly: An In-Depth Comparative Analysis,fosdem-2024-2769-the-jvm-vs-webassembly-an-in-depth-comparative-analysis,"<p>The JVM vs. WebAssembly: An In-Depth Comparative Analysis</p>
<p>This session contrasts, in extreme detail, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and WebAssembly (Wasm), two platforms that have reshaped the landscape of software development. While their basic architecture of a ""virtual machine"" draws parallels, their design, intentions, bytecode formats, and future directions reveal considerable differences.</p>
<p>Differences in Intent and Bytecode Adaptations</p>
<p>We'll examine the underlying intentions behind the creation of the JVM and WebAssembly. While the JVM was initially designed to support the Java language, it has since accommodated other languages like Scala, Groovy, and Kotlin, and has been provided with implementations for dynamic languages like Ruby and Python. WebAssembly, on the other hand, was designed from the outset to support multiple languages, aiming to serve as a compact binary format for the web. We'll analyze how these intentions have influenced the way other languages have been adapted to their respective bytecode formats, by carefully examining the pain points found in JVM and Wasm implementations across the same source languages</p>
<p>Bytecode Differences, Implementation, and Control Flow</p>
<p>Here we will delve into the technical details of each platform's bytecode. While the JVM uses stack-based bytecode, WebAssembly uses a structured stack machine model. The implications of these different approaches will be discussed, with particular attention to aspects like performance, security, and portability. We'll also explore their respective implementations and control flow mechanisms through the use of detailed code examples, as well as high-level expositions.</p>
<p>Standardization Processes, Stakeholders, and Incentives</p>
<p>An important part of this talk will focus on the standardization processes of both the JVM and WebAssembly. While the JVM’s specification is controlled by Oracle, with community input through the Java Community Process (JCP), WebAssembly is an open standard developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). We'll discuss the various stakeholders involved in each process and explore the incentives that drive the evolution of these systems.</p>
<p>The Future of WebAssembly</p>
<p>We'll discuss the future direction of WebAssembly, touching on upcoming proposals such as garbage collection, and the Component Model. Additionally, we'll look at the development of runtimes like Wasmtime, the WebAssembly Micro-Runtime (WAMR), and GraalWasm, and discuss how these work to extend the reach of WebAssembly in new and interesting ways</p>
<p>JVM and the Universal Compilation Target</p>
<p>In our closing discussion, we'll tackle the common assertion that WebAssembly is ""just the JVM again"", and explore why the JVM didn’t quite become the universal compilation target it was often touted years ago. Factors such as the JVM's resource usage, security issues, specific design details have all played a part, and we'll discuss how and what WebAssembly has learned from these challenges.</p>
<p>This session's ultimate goal is to give attendees a detailed understanding of the JVM and WebAssembly, enabling more informed decisions in software development and a clearer perspective on the futures of these two technologies.</p>"

V4L2 Stateless Video Encoding: Hardware Support and uAPI,fosdem-2024-3090-v4l2-stateless-video-encoding-hardware-support-and-uapi,"<p>Support for hardware video codecs has been around in V4L2 since the memory-to-memory (M2M) framework was merged in 2010. While it initially allowed support for firmware-driven stateful implementations, it did not cover the case of stateless hardware codecs where the kernel has to configure hardware blocks directly instead of relying on a (proprietary) firmware.</p>
<p>Stateless video decoding became supported in 2018 after Bootlin's successful crowdfunding campaign targeting Allwinner platforms. The only remaining piece missing after this work was support for stateless video encoders.</p>
<p>This talk will present the current effort to bring support for stateless video encoders in mainline V4L2. This includes an overview of the current preliminary work on selected hardware platforms and video codecs as well as a brief summary of today's out-of-tree support.

A fully open source stack for MIPI cameras,fosdem-2024-3013-a-fully-open-source-stack-for-mipi-cameras,"<p>Many recent Windows (on ARM and x86) laptops have replaced the standard UVC USB camera module with a raw MIPI camera-sensor using a CSI receiver and ISP in the CPU to process the raw data into an image.</p>
<p>Both the hw interface of the ISP as well as the image processing algorithms used are often considered a trade secret by CPU vendors. This makes supporting these cameras under Linux a big challenge and so far these cameras are not supported.</p>
<p>Both Linaro and Red Hat have identified this as a problem. Linaro has started a project to add a SoftwareISP component to libcamera to allow these cameras to work without needing
proprietary software and Red Hat has joined Linaro in working on this.</p>

enioka Scan: say No! to vendor lock-in for your barcode scanners,fosdem-2024-2103-enioka-scan-say-no-to-vendor-lock-in-for-your-barcode-scanners,"<p>The barcode scanner market is a walled garden hostile to flexibility. Vendors enforce their proprietary SDKs or applications, documentation is often limited or missing, sometimes it is even required to sign a contract before getting software access to purchased devices. This locks the user inside a single ecosystem, as switching to a different option would mean rewriting software specific to the device.</p>
<p>enioka Scan is an open-source Android library enabling users to choose the device vendors that really fit their criteria at any given time. It exposes a single API compatible with all supported scanning devices, working on top of a vendor-specific SDKs made open-source whenever possible. The library handles per-device specifics, so the user can focus on the functional aspects of their application. It is also designed to be easily extended with more support for devices not yet compatible.</p>
<p>In this presentation, we will go over the causes of vendor lock-in in the context of barcode scanning devices. After a quick history of the project, we will have an overview of how the library works and how it manages to handle devices from different vendors.

Linux CAN upstreaming on MMU-less systems,fosdem-2024-2864-linux-can-upstreaming-on-mmu-less-systems,"<p>This talk describes the issues and challenges I faced during the development of
the bxCAN driver on stm32f4/7 architectures for the Linux kernel. Focused on the
design and development of the driver, I soon realized that the classic user space
tools used for testing a CAN interface (i. e. iproute2 and can-utils) could not
be compiled on MMU-less systems.</p>
<p>The lack of MMU prevents the use of the fork() system call used by many Linux
applications. Currently in buildroot, for example, about half of the packages are
not supported on MMU-less systems. Furthermore, considering that busybox also does
not support the 'ip link' command for the CAN interface, it was evident that the
number of difficulties to overcome had increased so that, in addition to the driver
development, the user space also needed to be patched.
My target expanded: I definitively wanted to overcome the limitations of the user
space and make it available to the open-source community.</p>
<p>How has the development of the bxCAN driver evolved? Was it later merged into the
Linux kernel? Which packages needed to be patched to test it? What patches were
applied? What happened to them?
The talk addresses these and other questions that we will explore.</p>"
Zephyr and RISC-V: I Ain't Afraid Of No Ghosts,fosdem-2024-1725-zephyr-and-risc-v-i-ain-t-afraid-of-no-ghosts,"<p>RISC-V's instruction set architecture (ISA) has enabled seasoned embedded software engineers to experiment with FPGAs since numerous open-source RISC-V cores can be flashed onto an FPGA. The Zephyr Project is rapidly emerging as a leading real-time operating system (RTOS).  Zephyr integrates open-source and security best practices to ensure a vendor-neutral, secure, and reliable platform.</p>
<p>In this talk, Mohammed Billoo will describe the process of getting to Zephyr to run on the UPduino (https://tinyvision.ai/pages/the-upduino), flashed with the neorv32 RISC-V processor (https://github.com/stnolting/neorv32). He will walk through building and flashing the neorv32 RISC-V core on the FPGA, creating a Zephyr application that can output Hello World to the UART, and loading the application to the FPGA. Mohammed will also walk through the necessary Zephyr drivers to get the application running.
This talk will demonstrate how combining RISC-V and Zephyr on an FPGA opens up new opportunities for embedded software applications. Using open-source software and firmware on a low-cost FPGA reduces the bar for entry for enthusiasts and hobbyists. The audience will learn the following in this talk:</p>
<ul>
<li>Relevance of the RISC-V instruction set architecture for hobbyists</li>
<li>Overview and structure of the neorv32 RISC-V processor</li>
<li>Overview and structure of The Zephyr Project RTOS</li>
<li>RISC-V support in Zephyr</li>
<li>Relevant Zephyr drivers</li>

From an artificial nose weekend hack to a future-proof IoT device,fosdem-2024-3194-from-an-artificial-nose-weekend-hack-to-a-future-proof-iot-device,"<p>It was a long weekend in May 2020. Like many of my human siblings stuck at home with time on their hands due to an ongoing pandemic, I was busy trying to perfect my bread recipe. Fast forward to a few hours later, I had assembled an <strong>Arduino-based “artificial nose” that used a gas sensor and AI (so-called TinyML) to learn and detect scents</strong> (hence potentially the smell of a perfectly fermented sourdough starter). As I open-sourced and started to share the project on social media, it went viral… and I felt like an impostor, as most of the code powering it was, frankly, hackish. Or maybe it wasn’t, as it had the merit of having helped me invent something new, in literally a few hours.</p>
<p>In this talk I will <strong>walk you through some of the key features of the artificial nose, and how I eventually rewrote my original code to leverage Zephyr</strong> (an open-source real-time operating system) in order to make it easier for myself and the community to extend the project, and run it on a variety of hardware targets.</p>
<p>You will learn, among other things:
* How to move from a complex “super loop” to well architected threads and event-based programming ;
* How to run TinyML models (ex. TensorFlow Lite) while not compromising the rest of your embedded system ;
* How to build an efficient and easy-to-maintain graphical user interface ;
* How to leverage Zephyr hardware-abstraction layer.</p>
<p>All the code and demonstrations shown in the talk is open source and available on GitHub, and you are very much encouraged to go ahead and build your own artificial nose after the presentation!</p>"
Orchestrating Machine Learning on Edge Devices Using Akri and WebAssembly,fosdem-2024-3369-orchestrating-machine-learning-on-edge-devices-using-akri-and-webassembly,"<p>Edge computing is becoming increasingly popular for applications that require low latency and high bandwidth. However, building edge computing infrastructure that is both scalable and cost-effective can be challenging. In this talk, we will explore how Project Akri and WebAssembly can be used together to build highly scalable edge computing solutions. We will start by introducing Project Akri, an open-source project that provides a standard way to discover and interact with IoT devices at the edge of the network. We will then discuss how WASM, can be used to run code at the edge of the network, providing a lightweight and portable runtime environment for edge applications. We will also cover some use cases where Project Akri and WASM can be used together, such as building ML models that can run on edge devices or processing sensor data in real-time. Attendees of this talk will gain a better understanding of how the above can be used together to build scalable, cost-effective edge.</p>"
"Flutter, Buildroot, and you!",fosdem-2024-2495-flutter-buildroot-and-you-,"<p><a href=""https://flutter.dev/"">Flutter</a> is an open-source UI Software Development kit created by Google using the BSD-3-Clause license. It is used for developing multi-platform applications with a single codebase. While traditionally, Flutter has been used for Android and iOS development, it has been steadily gaining market share in the embedded Linux world. While the meta-flutter layer for Yocto has been usable since version 1.17.0 on March 31st, 2020, the Buildroot embedded Linux SDK has only recently added support, starting with <a href=""https://gitlab.com/buildroot.org/buildroot/-/blob/2023.11.x/package/flutter-engine/flutter-engine.mk?ref_type=heads#L24"">Flutter version 3.13.9 on Buildroot version 2023.11</a>. </p>
<p>This talk will cover three main points.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The first is a brief history of the numerous difficulties that had to be overcome when adding the Flutter packages and infrastructure to Buildroot. This topic covers several idiosyncrasies of obtaining the source code and cross-compiling Flutter, such as how the source code is downloaded, how it is not currently possible to create an automated reproducible tarball when downloading the source code, and generating a tarball because of a reliance on .git files, how every third-party dependency is bundled into the source tarball, and even a patched clang is included in the source tarball that must be used when compiling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The second point covers the advantages and disadvantages of Flutter compared to Qt QML and LVGL.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The final point covers how to start and integrate an existing Flutter project into an existing Buildroot infrastructure using the flutter-gallery package as a reference.  This includes using an external tree for development purposes, how to profile an application for performance, and problems/concerns to be aware of.</p>

The secret life of a goroutine,fosdem-2024-1704-the-secret-life-of-a-goroutine,"<p>Goroutines are an exciting part of the Go language, but what are they? How are they created? How are they paused? How are they resumed? There are a lot of questions that the regular go programmer doesn't need to know and usually doesn't know, but if you, like me, are a curious person, you probably want to know more about what is going on under the hood.</p>
<p>Come with me on this interesting trip through one of the most outstanding features of the Go language, the goroutines, and discover what makes your Go programs tick!
In this talk we are going to explore how is the life of a goroutine.</p>
<p>We are going to start talking about the go runtime scheduler in general, and we are going to talk about the most important structures there, P, M, G and Sched.</p>
<p>Once we have that clear we are going to explore how a goroutine is created and after the creation, how it change states, exploring the different states like Waiting, Runnable or Running, but also others. We are going to talk about the transitions between them to finish talking about the death of a goroutine.</p>
<p>After this talk you should have an intuition about how your goroutines are scheduled and why they transit from one state to another.</p>"

How we almost secured our projects by writing more tests,fosdem-2024-1884-how-we-almost-secured-our-projects-by-writing-more-tests,"<p>Since its early days (Go 1.2 - 2013), Go has offered great support for code coverage. Recently, the community also introduced the same support for integration tests. This feature gives projects written in Go better visibility about test coverage, resulting in enhanced stability and more.
ARMO's experiment consisted of providing the complete test coverage percentage as a metric for generated Seccomp profiles. During the automated tests we hooked the system calls, collecting them into a security profile, by using eBPF. This allowed us to measure the generated profile reliability that was created with the system calls used during this time.
Unfortunately, not all the experiments succeed.

On TinyGo, small displays, and building a delightful developer experience",fosdem-2024-2562-smartwatch-firmware-in-go-on-tinygo-small-displays-and-building-a-delightful-developer-experience,"<p>Building a nice and responsive GUI is no easy task. It is especially difficult when you're working with a small microcontroller and the existing graphics libraries have various limitations. So I set to work to fix that by building my own graphics library for small embedded systems.</p>
<p>A year ago I started working on a firmware for the Pine64 PineTime, using TinyGo of course. My goal was to have a usable firmware for the watch, while improving the surrounding TinyGo ecosysteem wherever I could. My end goal is to make developing firmware as simple as writing any desktop application.</p>
<p>In this talk I'll describe how I initially added support for the PineTime in TinyGo with some low level hardware details, how low cost displays work, and how I improved the performance of these displays under TinyGo. But I'll also describe how I built a somewhat accurate simulator as part of the hardware abstraction layer, how I implemented a very fast graphics library using generics, and of course how I used all of these to write firmware that can run on the PineTime and any similar smartwatch supported by TinyGo.</p>

A microkernel-based orchestrator for distributed Internet services?,fosdem-2024-3011-a-microkernel-based-orchestrator-for-distributed-internet-services-,"<p>In the recent years I have worked a lot on building community Internet services using distributed systems, in the context of Deuxfleurs, a French self-hosting collective. We use distributed systems with nodes in different physical locations to help us tolerate temporary failures such as Internet links going down, as well as hardware failures of our low-cost, second-hand servers.</p>
<p>We built our platform as a set of microservices, taking the form of Docker containers orchestrated by Nomad (a smaller Kubernetes). This allows us to divide our workload in pieces that can be ran on one or many machines simultaneously, and that can in most cases be automatically moved from one geographical region to another in case of failure. This approach works relatively well, however I am frustrated to no end by the idiosyncraties of containers and the Linux/UNIX ecosystem in general which contains huge piles of legacy and is massively getting in our way for building a clean, declarative and resilient dynamic microservice architecture.</p>
<p>I have a dream that one day we can build an orchestrator for microservices that is built on a microkernel, component-based operating system. We just need a way to simply multiplex fundamental resources such as storage and networking (NOT a filesystem, and NOT a full TCP/IP stack with iptables or whatnot), and to schedule and run unikernels or tiny Linux VMs in a cluster of machines. How hard can that be?</p>
<p>I will do a brief talk at the beginning but I'm hoping for this session to be mostly just talking of what can be done in this direction.</p>"
Streamlining application development for Genode with Goa,fosdem-2024-3089-streamlining-application-development-for-genode-with-goa,"<p>The <em>Genode OS Framework</em> is certainly not a newcomer and has seen continuous improvements in its quarterly releases for more than 15 years. <em>Sculpt</em>, the Genode-based desktop OS, has been around for more than five years and has proven itself to be fit for day-to-day use. Moreover, Sculpt OS has more recently been adapted to the <em>PinePhone</em>. With this solid foundation, application development for Genode comes brightly into the picture. For this purpose, the <em>Goa</em> tool has been initiated by <em>Norman Feske</em> in 2019 as a side project. By moving Goa under the umbrella of Genode's core developer team, the tool has seen various improvements over the past year.</p>

Is Toro unikernel faster for MPI?,fosdem-2024-1960-is-toro-unikernel-faster-for-mpi-,"<p>MPI applications are parallel applications that require CPU, memory and high-throughput channels to communicate. These applications are usually deployed on top of a general purpose operating system that provides services like memory allocation, process creation, inter-process communication and networking. The resources like memory or CPU are shared with other processes in the system and with the OS itself. The MPI application competes for host's resources thus limiting its scalability. In this talk, we present the recent effort to build an implementation of the MPI standard on top of the Toro unikernel. In this deployment, we provide a minimalist implementation of the MPI standard as a library that compiles with the application and the kernel thus resulting in a single binary that can be deployed as microVM. Such a library leverages the parallelism that Toro proposes to effectively deploy a MPI application.  Some of the benefits of  using Toro are one instance per core, cooperative scheduler without preemption and local resources. To benchmark our implementation, we port some the OSU Micro-Benchmarks and run them in the Intel Xeon Gold platform. We report the benefits of our architecture when comparing it with existing MPI implementation on Linux.</p>"
News from the Hermit Crab — From Soundness Foundations to GPU Virtualization,fosdem-2024-3375-news-from-the-hermit-crab-from-soundness-foundations-to-gpu-virtualization,"<p>The Rust-based <a href=""https://github.com/hermit-os"">Hermit operating system project</a> allows you to compile your application against our modular library operating system to create a unikernel image, which can run in a VM.</p>
<p>This unikernel image is much more lightweight than traditional VM images, which contain a full-blown Linux Distribution. We are talking <em>Mega</em>bytes in size instead of Gigabytes. That's because the unikernel image can be specialized to the application that runs and the environment that the image runs in. Having only one application per VM also allows Hermit to be a <em>single address space operating system</em>. That means we don't have to do any context switches between user space and kernel spaces and every system call becomes a function call into the library operating system.</p>

Linux Binary Compatible Unikernels with Unikraft,fosdem-2024-3386-linux-binary-compatible-unikernels-with-unikraft,"<p>Application-specific unikernels have the reputation for being complicated to create. Instead, being binary compatible with Linux promises that you can use a unikernel as a simple drop-in replacement, especially for running container workloads. But how can we avoid redeveloping Linux for compatibility reasons? What about <code>fork</code>, <code>clone</code> and co. while maintaining a single address space? Where can we still specialize and keep performance benefits?</p>
<p>In this talk we will dive into our efforts over the last year with <a href=""https://unikraft.org"">Unikraft</a> for binary compatibility with Linux. We'll discuss the challenges we have solved, the lessons we have learned, and the optimizations we have been able to make. In all of this, we have set the goal of not requiring to recompile any application code.</p>"
Support Dynamically Linked Executables via Linux ld.so and Implement ENA Driver to Expand Application of OSv,fosdem-2024-3483-support-dynamically-linked-executables-via-linux-ld-so-and-implement-ena-driver-to-expand-application-of-osv,"<p>From the beginning, OSv has been designed to implement a subset of the Linux flavor of POSIX API. Initially, most Linux applications had to be re-compiled from source as shared libraries. Starting with the release 0.54.0, it has become possible to run unmodified Linux position-independent executables (so-called ""PIEs"") and position-dependent executables ""as-is"".</p>
<p>In my presentation, I will talk about how OSv has been enhanced to support running statically linked executables. Not only that, the same improvements make it possible to execute dynamically linked executables via Linux dynamic linker. I will also briefly describe a newly added strace-like capability aimed to help analyze system calls on the fly.</p>
<p>Finally, I will also explain how we have implemented the ENA networking driver and thus made it possible to run OSv on AWS Nitro EC2 instances.</p>"
A Modular Approach to Effortless and Dependency-Aware Unikernel Building,fosdem-2024-3456-a-modular-approach-to-effortless-and-dependency-aware-unikernel-building,"<p>One of the key aspects of Unikernels is modularity: each component can be considered a standalone library that users selectively incorporate into their Unikernel. This design flexibility empowers users to create minimal and specialized images tailored for individual applications. Despite the advantageous compartmentalization, the process of building a Unikernel remains monolithic. Users must download the Unikernel framework, along with any external dependencies, and engage in a build-from-scratch procedure, even with minimal code changes.</p>
<p>We propose Bunny, a novel build system that aims to simplify the process of building Unikernels. Bunny creates an alternative build process, making full use of the modular aspect of Unikernels. We structure <code>Bunny</code> using a layered approach, where each component represents a distinct layer. Users do not need to build each component from scratch; instead, each respective layer is fetched and can be used to produce the resulting Unikernel image. Moreover, <code>Bunny</code> keeps track of all the dependencies for each component, relieving users from the pain of manually identifying and building all the dependencies.</p>"

Localization of Open Source Tools into Swahili,fosdem-2024-2624-localization-of-open-source-tools-into-swahili,"<p>The localization of open-source tools is pivotal for expanding their utility, particularly in countries from the global majority. It ensures that individuals worldwide, irrespective of their language or cultural background, can effectively utilize these tools. By localizing them, we not only widen the reach of these tools but also create an opportunity to engage more volunteers who become integral members of the open-source community.</p>"
A universal data model for localizable messages,fosdem-2024-1759-a-universal-data-model-for-localizable-messages,"<p>One of the results of the Unicode Consortium's work on defining the MessageFormat 2 specification is a <a href=""https://github.com/unicode-org/message-format-wg/tree/main/spec/data-model"">data model for messages</a> that's intended to be sufficiently powerful to represent all known features of all known localization formats.

Agama: Low-Code Web Identity Orchestration,fosdem-2024-2801-agama-low-code-web-identity-orchestration,"<p>Web authentication is more complex then ever. While out-of-the-box 2FA features are helpful, sometimes developers need to customize authentication flows to meet specific business requirements, like registration, credential recovery, or adaptive security to step-up authentication based on risk scores.  All IDPs have some kind of black magic to implement customizations--normally some script or code interface. But at the <a href=""https://jans.io"">Janssen Project</a>, we saw how hard it is to write, maintain and transfer this custom authentication code, and we wanted something more re-usable. So in early 2021, we introduced <a href=""https://docs.jans.io/head/agama/introduction/"">Agama</a>, a low-code programming language to simplify the development of web identity journeys. Agama defines a standard way to build web identity journeys in a potentially vendor-neutral way. It’s both a programming language and a project archive format. In 2023, Gluu launched <a href=""https://agama-lab.gluu.org"">Agama Lab</a>, a free developer tool. Agama Lab takes low code to a new level by enabling developers and architects to graphically white board identity journeys and to release deployable Agama archives directly to a GitHub repository. The Agama Lab Explore Catalog enables developers to fork working projects and adapt them more specific business requirements. Low code may seem silly--yes you can also just write the code. But low code can reduce the time to knowledge-transfer customizations to the next team. And graphical tools faciliate communciation with the non-identity team to help explain the various flows and how they relate.</p>"

Role of IGA in Access Management with Multilateral Identities,fosdem-2024-2425-role-of-iga-in-access-management-with-multilateral-identities,"<p>Identity Governance and Administration (IGA), as a natural extension of Identity Management, is a core component of any IT infrastructure. It automates user processes (joiner, mover, leaver) and their accounts in the whole infrastructure. Access Management (AM) is an inherent partner of IGA. It provides authentication and, to some extent, authorization for end users. To reach the full potential of both IGA and AM, it is necessary to interconnect them. </p>
<p>This talk will focus on open-source IGA midPoint and show how it can deliver extra features when well-integrated with an AM system. We will cover basics like providing information about users and their access to the AM. Then, we will focus on how information from AM can flow to IGA and enable features like just-in-time provisioning even to systems that do not support it natively. Moreover, the data from AM, like login timestamps, can enhance IGA reporting capabilities and even enable the preparation of complex access policies. That can further automate your processes for managing accounts and use to tighten security and even save money for usage and licencing costs.</p>
<p>Ultimately, we will examine the partially implemented feature of midPoint for managing multilateral identities and use them to create a unified user profile. It envisioned this feature would interlace traditional on-premise identities (HR, student registry, customer databases, etc.) with identity federations, social, national and other IDs.</p>"

Improving the performance of Olympus crypto library,fosdem-2024-2283-improving-the-performance-of-olympus-crypto-library,"<p>In recent years, there has been significant interest in the efficient implementation of cryptographic protocols for applications in IoT devices and smartphones. As network technologies advance and software development environments become more demanding, there is an inherent need for secure and efficient communications. Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) has garnered attention from developers due to its ability to produce more efficient cryptographic algorithms, serving as the foundational technology for blockchain. </p>
<p>The <a href=""https://bitbucket.alexandra.dk/projects/OL/repos/olympus-identity"">Olympus library</a> is one of the fundamental libraries used for developing encryption tools based on elliptic curves. Several cryptographic libraries have been developed to extend the library and implement pairing on elliptic curves, such as the <a href=""https://crypto.stanford.edu/pbc/"">pbc library</a>, <a href=""https://github.com/herumi/mcl"">mcl library</a>, <a href=""https://github.com/miracl/core/tree/master/java"">miracle library</a>. Thus, the performance of the functionality provided by the Olympus library is of high importance and impact. In this context, we propose performance optimizations to Olympus library for improving the performance without sacrificing the functionality and the advanced security characteristics of the library. More specifically, we improve the performance of the cryptographic functionality based on elliptic curves (GNU Crypto) provided by the Olympus library.</p>"

Fixing a Kerberos vulnerability with the bare necessities,fosdem-2024-2681-fixing-a-kerberos-vulnerability-with-the-bare-necessities,"<p>Fixing vulnerabilities on long term support distributions can be a challenging task. Constraints such as protocol compatibility or ABI stability often get in the way of backporting security fixes. When a fix simply is incompatible with an older OS version, designing a new one taking advantage of the limited processes and data available might be required.

The talk will show how to automate FreeIPA deployment and configuration to integrate with Microsoft Active Directory and also how to configure and use External Identity Providers, using the ansible-freeipa project.
Recent versions of ansible-freeipa allow id overrides for AD users, for example enabling an AD administrator to act as a FreeIPA administrator, performing tasks like enroll new clients, deploy or promote replicas, and manage users, also to use the self-service features.
External IdP support has been recently added to FreeIPA. The registration with an integrated IdP enables FreeIPA to act as an OAuth 2.0 client to handle authentication of the user identity and authorize access to it. This integration and the required changes to users can be automated using ansible-freeipa.

POSIX identities out of OAuth2 identity providers: how to redesign SSSD and Samba?,fosdem-2024-2587-posix-identities-out-of-oauth2-identity-providers-how-to-redesign-sssd-and-samba-,"<p>With a move to cloud-based hosting of the application servers, a typical application is not a member of the same corporate IT environment anymore. Application servers often use OAuth 2.0 protocol flows to identify their users. Identity Providers (IdPs) provide OAuth 2.0 endpoints to applications and pull
over the tasks of authenticating and authorizing users’ access to application resources. They become a central point of interaction between enterprise domains, if those still in use in the organization, and applications. This approach allows to integrate both in-house applications and cloud-based SaaS
applications provided by third parties.</p>
<p>The separation of enterprise IT architecture and an enterprise domain structure, however, leads to a larger issue. While in the past management of the application servers was part of the enterprise domain services (Active Directory, RHEL IdM, …) where regular users and application developers were
present at the same time. Maintaining common access to these servers was easy: since the application server is enrolled into the domain, it can consume domain identities. Not anymore: there is no such guarantee to have both application servers and application developers belonging to the same domain. Effectively, there is a need to access information that is only available in a federated way: through some broker, like IdP. On top of that, the broker might not be able to pass through a certain type of information that might simply not exist on the other side. For example, for Linux servers working together as a compute capacity, it is crucial to have a uniform view on POSIX information about users and groups. But an IdP might simply lack this information because there might be no need for it at the place where a user account is defined.</p>
<p>This talk aims to define a common set of requirements and approaches to represent a secure POSIX identity management integration with OAuth 2.0-based identity providers. Aside from requirements towards client software on the Linux platform, we aim to define possible requirements towards other components of the integration, based on our experience developing Samba, SSSD, and FreeIPA for more than 25 years.</p>"

Documenting My Journey: Contributing to GCC as a GSoC 2023 Participant,fosdem-2024-2216-documenting-my-journey-contributing-to-gcc-as-a-gsoc-2023-participant,"<h2>Bypass assembler when generating LTO object file</h2>
<p>This summer, I worked with my mentor Jan Hubicka and Martin Jambor on a project to bypass assembler when generating LTO object files. Here is a brief insight into my project:
Link Time Optimization (LTO) enables GCC to dump its internal representation (GIMPLE) to disk so that a single executable can be optimized as a single module. The current implementation creates an assembly file, and the assembler creates the final LTO object file from the provided binary contents. This project aims to create Link-time-optimization (LTO) object files directly from the compiler to improve compile time performance significantly by bypassing the assembler. The GCC's LTO infrastructure has matured enough to compile large real-world applications. Thus, this project will significantly reduce their compile time once completed.

What can Compiler-Explorer do for GCC,fosdem-2024-2759-what-can-compiler-explorer-do-for-gcc,"<p>Compiler-Explorer is a website which main usage consists in entering a program
in a text field and getting the corresponding assembly output, for a given set
of user selected compilers. Compiler-Explorer has more than 2000 compilers installed and executes 4M compilations/week. Yet Compiler-Explorer can do much more than simply displaying the assembly: sharing a compilation, using libraries, executing the program, using various tools (on source code or on resulting binaries), visualizing the CFG, accessing its services through an API, etc.</p>
<p>For a compiler user, the website is useful to test how a given language construct is compiled, to optimize for size and/or performance, etc. For a compiler developer, the website can be used to share bug reproducer, test if a bug applies to other versions of the compiler, inspect IR dumps, use scripts to automate some tasks, etc.</p>
<p>I'm proposing a short presentation focused on how Compiler-Explorer can be used around GCC: compare the results of different compilations, inspect the Tree/RTL dumps, check the result for other compiler versions/arguments, etc. I'm also interested in getting some feedback and/or ideas for new features.</p>"
Unlocking Secret Analysis in GCC Static Analyzer,fosdem-2024-2635-unlocking-secret-analysis-in-gcc-static-analyzer,"<p>GCC Static Analyzer (SA) is a highly promising tool aiming to enhance the compiler with extensive analysis capabilities, such as through the use of a plugin API.
We used it to implement an analysis targeting <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timing_attack#Avoidance"">constant-time vulnerabilities</a>.
Most of the existing tools rely on formal methods and remain barely used (see <a href=""https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Marcel-Fourne/publication/361209537_They're_not_that_hard_to_mitigate_What_Cryptographic_Library_Developers_Think_About_Timing_Attacks/links/62a32677416ec50bdb1af307/Theyre-not-that-hard-to-mitigate-What-Cryptographic-Library-Developers-Think-About-Timing-Attacks.pdf"">Jancar et al.</a>).
This study conclude that compiler-based tools are well-received among cryptographic developers.</p>
<p>Our initial tests highlighted that the primary design of the analyzer's inner state machines heavily relies on pointer-related analysis, which leverages alias analysis.
However, it was triggering undesirable side effects in our case.
The needs for our analysis is to also be able to track state for lvalue, alongside rvalue, depending of the target's type.</p>
<p>The subject of this talk is to introduce a practical case where this behavior would allow such analysis to be done, especially since the SA codebase is already heavily prepared for it.
A proof-of-concept to give this ability to the SA has been implemented and aims to be merged after feedback from the community on the idea.
Problems caused by some aspects of C semantics arise and will be interesting to discuss (e.g., the thin frontier between arrays and pointers).</p>

Can the mold linker be /usr/bin/ld?,fosdem-2024-2606-can-the-mold-linker-be-usr-bin-ld-,"<p><a href=""https://github.com/rui314/mold"">mold</a> is an open-source, fast, and portable linker for ELF. I'm the creator of the mold linker as well as the LLVM lld linker. It looks like mold is rapidly gaining importance among the GNU toolchain users because it's the only modern linker that supports all GCC features. In contrast, GNU ld is too slow for large projects, GNU gold lacks adequate maintenance, and LLVM lld does not support GCC LTO.</p>
<p>If mold is better than GNU ld, why can't we use it as /usr/bin/ld? In most instance, we actually can, except one major use case: kernel/embedded programming.</p>

Build Distribution for Maintaining the Famous GCC 4.7,fosdem-2024-2690-build-distribution-for-maintaining-the-famous-gcc-4-7,"<p>Many GNU Linux distributions start their own bootstrap process with a set of binary seeds. Because, how do you build a modern C/C++ compiler without a C/C++ compiler? To solve this chicken-and-egg problem, an approach taken by some distributions is to rely on opaque, pre-build binaries. However, in order to increase trustworthiness in software, we should be able to produce every part of it from source, or at least reduce the size of the initial binary seed to the absolute minimum.</p>
<p>In the bootstrappable builds movement, the GCC version 4.7 plays an important role: it is the last GCC version that can be built with only a C compiler. Therefore, this compiler is a stepping stone for bootstrapping everything that relies on the C++ language and above. Another important metric for trustworthiness is the capability to build reproducibly, independently of the build directory, which we addressed with patches, as it is not a native feature of this compiler version. Furthermore, additional patches were required for bringing this compiler version up to date, i.e., adding support for more recent C libraries (e.g., the musl libc) and for obtaining a compiler installation that works independently of its install prefix.</p>
<p>We would like to present a build description (for the <em>JustBuild</em> build system), used to patch and bootstrap a GCC version 4.7 on a minimal x86_64 Linux system, which only needs a POSIX shell, coreutils, and a C library (GNU, musl) installed. To achieve this, the bootstrap process starts by building Busybox, GNU Make, and Binutils from scratch before those are used to bootstrap GCC 4.7. We can furthermore show how that compiler can then be used to bootstrap additional build tools (Make, CMake, Python) and even the most recent compilers (GCC 13.2, Clang 17), all from source on the exact same minimal system. In doing so, we basically bootstrap an extremely minimalistic Linux distribution for building compiler toolchains. All of that is strictly defined within a single <em>JustBuild</em> project, which is publicly available under an open-source license at: https://github.com/just-buildsystem/bootstrappable-toolchain.</p>"
Sega Dreamcast Homebrew with GCC,fosdem-2024-2634-sega-dreamcast-homebrew-with-gcc,"<p>One of the greatest strengths of GCC is the sheer volume of architectures which it can target, many of which are niche or legacy platforms. But how has this support translated into real-world utility? How well are some of these platforms still supported? Using the Sega Dreamcast and its SH4 CPU as a case-study, we take a look at just how far GCC is allowing its homebrew community to take the platform, providing modern C23, C++23, Objective-C, D, and even some Rust to the 1990s game console.</p>"
Welcome to the LLVM dev room,fosdem-2024-3582-welcome-to-the-llvm-dev-room,<p>A word of welcome by the LLVM Dev room organizers.</p>
Patch based test coverage for quick test feedback,fosdem-2024-2371-patch-based-test-coverage-for-quick-test-feedback,"<p>Most of the day to day tests in LLVM are regression tests executed by Lit, structured as source code or IR to be passed to some binary, rather than test code directly calling the code to be tested. This has many advantages but can make it difficult to predict which code path is executed when the compiler is invoked with a certain test input, especially for edge cases where error handling is involved. The goal of this work was to help developers create good test coverage for their patch and enable reviewers to verify that they have done so. To accomplish this we have introduced a tool that can be fed a patch as input, add coverage instrumentation for the affected source files, runs Lit tests, and records which test cases cause each counter to be executed. For each counter we then report the test cases executing the counter, but perhaps more importantly we also report the test cases executing the counter that are also changed in some way by the patch, since a modified line that results in zero counter isn’t properly tested, unless it’s intended to be a non-functional change.</p>

Build your first Clang compilation database plugin,fosdem-2024-2706-build-your-first-clang-compilation-database-plugin,"<p>The compilation database aids tools such as <code>clangd</code> in selecting the correct compiler flags for source files. It is commonly located found as <code>compilation_database.json</code> in the build directory. With tools like <a href=""https://github.com/Sarcasm/compdb"">compdb</a>, you can modify the file according to your needs. <code>clangd</code> itself provides a flexible configuration file. But what if you require more flexibility or have specific needs for your code base?</p>
<p>In this introductory presentation I give a brief overview of how Clang utilizes the compilation database and discuss the reasons and methods for extending it. Clang's <code>CompilationDatabasePlugin</code> allows extending and modifying compilation commands directly in your tooling at runtime. I show an example plugin that uses custom heuristics to find compiler flags for unknown files, e.g. for header files.</p>

elfconv: AOT compiler that translates Linux/AArch64 ELF binary to LLVM bitcode targeting WebAssembly,fosdem-2024-2254-elfconv-aot-compiler-that-translates-linux-aarch64-elf-binary-to-llvm-bitcode-targeting-webassembly,"<p>WebAssembly (WASM) enables us to use sandbox environments on edge devices and servers as well as browsers so that we can distribute platform-independent and secure applications. Previously, we could compile from several programming languages to WASM binary, but cannot generate them if we cannot use original source codes.
  In this talk, Masashi will introduce ""elfconv"",  an AOT compiler that translates Linux/AArch64 ELF binary into LLVM bitcode targeting WASM. This compiler generates an LLVM bitcode that translates every instruction of the original ELF binary based on remill (library for lifting machine code to LLVM IR) and uses emscripten to generate the WASM binary. we can execute the generated WASM binary using Wasm Runtime (e.g. Wasmedge, Wasmtime). This talk will describe the technical details (methods to translate to LLVM bitcode and emulate Linux syscall targeting WASM) of elfconv and the performance of translating and future perspectives.

Map LLVM values to corresponding source-level expressions,fosdem-2024-1682-map-llvm-values-to-corresponding-source-level-expressions,"<p>An interface which takes an LLVM value at any point in the LLVM transformations pipeline and returns a string corresponding to the equivalent source-level expression. We are especially interested in using this interface to map addresses used in load/store instructions to equivalent source-level memory references.
The primary objective of this project is to enhance the effectiveness of compiler-generated remarks and analysis reports for code optimization. These messages, while often comprehensive, lack direct connections to the corresponding source-level expressions. The goal is to bridge this gap by utilizing LLVM's intrinsic functions, which establish mappings between LLVM program entities and source-level expressions. The project specifically focuses on utilizing these intrinsic functions to generate or derive source expressions from LLVM values. This functionality is particularly important for enhancing memory access optimizations, including the reporting of memory access dependences that hinder vectorization.</p>"

SBOM: What's next?,fosdem-2024-2939-sbom-what-s-next-,"<p>The Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) has frequently been cited as a crucial component in securing the software supply chain. Its value proposition is the ability to answer critical questions such as, ""Am I vulnerable to CVE-XYZ?"". In theory, SBOM should simplify risk assessment by prioritizing the remediation of vulnerable applications. However, when considering the software supply chain as a whole and the myriad potential threat vectors (https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/threats), it's clear that SBOM provides limited utility when securing software delivery from producer to consumer.</p>
<p>How is an SBOM produced? How is it delivered? Does it bundle the artifacts it describes? Can you verify the provenance of the SBOM? These questions lead us to ask whether the SBOM has any real utility as a standalone entity.</p>
<p>In this session, we shall introduce the Open Component Model (OCM, https://ocm.software), an open standard and tooling that supports establishing a secure software supply chain, from producer to consumer. OCM's dedicated tooling packages security and compliance-relevant metadata, such as SBOMs, alongside the software artifacts. It includes support for signing operations, as well as secure transport of artifacts ensuring their integrity and provenance.

<p>Out of this effort, the protobom project was born. </p>
<p>Protobom is a project that offers a universal, format-neutral SBOM I/O layer designed to work with SBOM data in a unified way. The project frees developers from caring about the nuisance of ingesting and writing SBOMs. Through a single interface, applications can handle any SBOM format when reading, writing and transforming the data. Protobom is defined in protocol buffers which makes it ideal for storing and transmitting SBOM data. It also means that the project is multilanguage.</p>
<p>On top of the I/O layer, protobom has a rich graph API helping developers query, remix, diff and filter information read from SBOMs. The project is young, but it is already at the core of various supply chain security projects under the OpenSSF umbrella, including SBOMit and OpenVEX.</p>

How to make SPDX industry standard for AI/ML,fosdem-2024-3169-how-to-make-spdx-industry-standard-for-ai-ml,"<p>With SBOMs being required and SPDX meeting ISO/IEC 5962:202. It is beneficial for developers to adopt SPDX to generate the SBOM for their software. However, with AL and ML taking more and more centre stage in modern applications, how can we make sure SPDX can be useful to AI/ML applications?</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Recently since the bill from the US government has made SBOM the standard in software distributions, all developers have started to think about how they can automate and generate SBOM with all the components stated as required. SPDX is one of the obvious choices for all as its specification is recognized as the international open standard for security.</p>
<p>The stable release of SPDX 2.3 is good enough for most applications. Looking forward, as modern software applications are getting more and more complicated and there are more and more components involved - with the popularity of big data and AI/ML, many applications will involve data and data pipelines. These would need to be considered when generating SBOM in the future. </p>
<p>In this talk, we will look into what has SPDX 2.3 achieved, what is added in SPDX 3.0 for data and AI, and how we can encourage the AI/Ml community to consider SPDX in their applications.</p>
<h2>Goal</h2>
<p>Bring awareness of SBOM and SPDX to the developers and data community. Suggest some strategies in getting more adoption, especially the adoption of SPDX 3.0 to AI/ML communities.</p>
<h2>Target Audiences</h2>
<p>Developers and engineers who work with data. Community leaders who are interested in encouraging the community to build safer software.</p>

Application of the SPDX Safety Profile in the Safety Scope of the Zephyr Project,fosdem-2024-3211-application-of-the-spdx-safety-profile-in-the-safety-scope-of-the-zephyr-project,"<p>Creating and maintaining a safety critical project comes with a lot of challenges. One central issue is keeping your documentation, starting from planning and guideline documents, down to requirements, safety analysis, reviews and tests, consistent and up to date. These project artefacts often have their own lifecycle and are natively managed in different tools, with usually great traceability capabilities regarding dependencies between these artefacts as long as you stay within one tool or within a (usually propriety) tool family of one single tool vendor. Currently the resulting traceability gaps between these tools are handled either by the popular engineering tools like MS Excel or methods like “search for identical names”, depending highly on manual maintenance. 
Using SPDX relationships, the upcoming Safety Profile in SPDX 3.1 will provide a model to represent all these dependencies as a knowledge model that can be used both to analyse possible impacts after a change (be it because of a security update or functional variants of your product), provide evidence of completeness and compliance as a Safety SBOM or simply keep track of your product variants.
In this talk we will provide both an introduction to the SPDX Safety Profile as well as a real life example using StrictDoc and the Zephyr Project’s Functional Safety scope.</p>"

<p>We'll shed some light on the questions you should ask about your SBOMs, who, and how you can achieve trust at each step of their lifecycle. </p>
<p>We'll dip our toes into the why now, and how we can leverage OpenSource tools and specifications like in-toto attestations, Content Addressable Store, Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts (""salsa""), or Sigstore to have SBOMs that are uniquely identifiable, unforgeable, complete, and available.</p>

12 months of SBOMs - an experience report,fosdem-2024-1896-12-months-of-sboms-an-experience-report,<p>The CVE Binary Tool (https://github.com/intel/cve-bin-tool) is a Python tool which helps you determine if your system includes known vulnerabilities. It takes a variety of inputs including binaries and SBOMs (both SPDX and CycloneDX are supported). Our build process has been generating a SBOM (a build/deploy version using SBOM4Python (https://github.com/anthonyharrison/sbom4python)) every week and storing it within the GitHub repo. A detailed  analysis of the generated SBOMs over the past 12 months has identified a number of interesting observations which were not immediately apparent before SBOMs were being generated. It addresses some key questions such as “How much  does an SBOM change and how often?“ and “ Does your SBOM depend on your environment?“. This presentation shares these observations and provides a number of recommendations to be followed when generating SBOMs as part of the build process.</p>
Phantom dependencies in Python (and what to do about them),fosdem-2024-3146-phantom-dependencies-in-python-and-what-to-do-about-them-,"<p>The increasing use of AI-driven Python libraries necessitates robust scanning of Python projects for vulnerabilities. However, Python's dynamic typing and reliance on manifest files for dependency management make it challenging to detect hidden ""phantom"" dependencies. These unreported dependencies introduce uncertainty and risk into software composition analysis, as seen in OpenAI's baseline codebase. This session explores program analysis, particularly reachability analysis, to expose these phantom dependencies and create accurate dependency sets. Despite the challenges posed by Python's dynamic nature, program analysis remains crucial for secure and reliable software development. Understanding phantom dependencies and their impact is vital for Python developers to build robust and secure software.</p>"

Diversity and agility are high values in the Software community. Diversity and agility in Software Development processes and tools are a challenge for automation, though.</p>
<p>Accurate Software Composition Analysis is an important capability to keep transparency throughout the Software Lifecycle and is the base for the fulfillment of important non-functional requirements in the business context (e.g. SBOM-creation, Vulnerability Tracking, License compliance etc.)</p>
<p>To handle automation with both aspects - accurate Software Composition Analysis and heterogeneous and agile environments -  the Abstraction Layer for Software Composition Analysis of the new Eclipse Foundation ALSCA Project plays an important role.</p>
<p>The ALSCA-project consolidates the requirements from the tooling side on the one hand and the requirements from the institutionalized operation side in medium to large organizations on the other hand. Concerning specifications and wording it will be based on the capability map created by the Open Chain Tooling Group in the context of Open Source Management (https://github.com/Open-Source-Compliance/Sharing-creates-value/tree/master/Tooling-Landscape/CapabilityMap).</p>
<p>The ALSCA-server provides blueprints to run central Software Composition Analysis pipelines at scale while covering a large range of project setups (e.g. from Mobile Apps using Cocoapods to Cloud Services using Java/Maven) and configurable extent of analysis (e.g. from mere SBOM-creation to full-blast Dependency Analysis including Vulnerabilities and Copyright/License reports).To achieve this, the ALSCA-server is based on the OSS Review Toolkit and makes use of its integration APIs for dependency analysis, license scanning, vulnerability databases, rule engine, and report generation. The ALSCA project itself will concentrate on the server functionality including user and role management and the necessary APIs.</p>"
Getting lulled into a false sense of security by SBOM and VEX,fosdem-2024-3230-getting-lulled-into-a-false-sense-of-security-by-sbom-and-vex,"<p>SBOM and VEX represent an important step towards managing software products and software vulnerabilities more efficiently and effectively. The accelerating development of standards and tooling is driven by the promise to answer one important question: Which of the thousands of CVEs published per year affect a given software product?</p>
<p>However, the mere presence of such documents can lull consumers into a false sense of security. Studies have shown that the accuracy of SBOM and VEX documents greatly varies from one producer to another.</p>
<p>The production of accurate SBOM and VEX documents requires connecting products to components, components to vulnerabilities and vulnerabilities to (vulnerable) functions. But establishing those connections is hindered by development practices, the dynamics of open source projects, low-quality vulnerability databases and other factors… </p>

Sharing and reusing SBOMs with the OSSelot curation database,fosdem-2024-3074-sharing-and-reusing-sboms-with-the-osselot-curation-database,"<p>A major advantage of FOSS is the possibility to reuse existing components. Thus, it seems obvious to adopt the same strategy for FOSS compliance material in those areas where the required efforts are identical for all users of the software. With standard formats, such as SPDX, it is possible to share the results of data curation with the community, and thereby reduce the individual effort. The OSSelot project has set itself precisely this task: Creating a publicly available database of curated compliance materials for frequently used FOSS components including SPDX reports for each component. In order to foster usability of the data and external contributions, aspects such as trustworthiness, liability and integration of the data into existing tools must also be considered. </p>
<p>This presentation will demonstrate the stringent curation and review process of the OSSelot data that ensures that all internal and external contributions meet the same high quality standard. It will also exemplify how the OSSelot resources can be used to fulfill FOSS license obligations. To increase the project’s practical relevance, a discussion is encouraged on how the data can be used with existing tools and what adaptions are required to do so.</p>

Welcome to Nix!,fosdem-2024-2840-welcome-to-nix-,"<p>Why does Nix even have its own devroom at FOSDEM? What is Nix anyways?
Let me tell you when to care about Nix, how it changed my life, and how it can change yours too!</p>"
Fortifying the Foundations: Elevating Security in Nix and NixOS,fosdem-2024-2204-fortifying-the-foundations-elevating-security-in-nix-and-nixos,"<p>Securing NixOS and Nixpkgs is critical for widespread adoption. As one of the nine recently selected Sovereign Tech Fund projects, the focus is centrally aimed on reducing reliance on external binaries, ensuring code integrity during compilation, and implementing mechanisms for delivering up-to-date, secure software sustainably. We discuss the implementation by the Nix security team that focuses on streamlining processes, enhancing NixOS and Nixpkgs security, and transparently communicating vulnerability patch timelines to users, delving into the strategies implemented in phase one of this project to fortify NixOS and Nixpkgs security efficiently and effectively.</p>"
Packaging Bazel and Bazel-based packages,fosdem-2024-3061-packaging-bazel-and-bazel-based-packages,"<p>Bazel is a build system to rule them all. It tries to enforce purity on it's own, and has not been built around the idea that it could be used inside another build system, like... Nix! This makes it really difficult to package, and even more difficult to make it cooperate with Nix to build other packages.</p>
<p>This talk will build upon on my experience packaging and testing Bazel 7.0.0 for nixpkgs. Going through the most interesting fixes required to make it work, we will also discuss hermeticity in both build systems, dependencies pinning with lockfiles, sandboxing, caching, remote execution and then some more.</p>
<p>Packaging Bazel for Nix has been an intense experience, and you will get all the nice bits without the hard work !</p>"
Remediating thousands of untracked security vulnerabilities in nixpkgs,fosdem-2024-1983-remediating-thousands-of-untracked-security-vulnerabilities-in-nixpkgs,"<p>Through <em>vendoring</em>, many packages in <code>nixpkgs</code> end up including obsolete and vulnerable versions of their dependencies. This is especially prevalent for Rust, Go, JavaScript, Java and .NET software using strict lockfiles. How bad is the current situation really? What can <code>nixpkgs</code> contributors do to improve it?</p>"
Nix for genetics : powering a bioinformatics pipeline,fosdem-2024-3058-nix-for-genetics-powering-a-bioinformatics-pipeline,"<p>Diagnosing genetic diseases presents significant challenges. Modern sequencers produce vast amounts of data, requiring intensive processing and filtering before analysis. The intricate mechanisms in rare diseases necessitate a high level of expertise from biologists to identify potential causes. This is why it is crucial to demonstrate these results come from accurate, efficient, and reproducible bioinformatics pipelines. Indeed, accuracy is vital for patient diagnosis, efficiency is needed to handle the growing data volume and patient backlog, and reproducibility is essential to ensure the quality of the results.</p>
<p>This talk is aimed at a diverse audience and will give feedback on Nix integration in our workflow.
It will focus on how Nix significantly improved reproducibility and discuss some challenges we encountered, especially with large databases and running on high-performance computing architectures.</p>"
Automatic boot assessment with boot counting,fosdem-2024-3045-automatic-boot-assessment-with-boot-counting,<p>Ever had the bad surprise of accidentally killing your server by rebooting in a bad NixOS generation and needed physical intervention ? Boot counting is a feature of systemd-boot that will save you from these unfortunate situations and that is now available in NixOS. This talk will consist of quick explanation and demo of the feature.</p>

It is fully declarative and comes with a webapp.</p>"
rix: an R package for reproducible dev environments with Nix,fosdem-2024-1767-rix-an-r-package-for-reproducible-dev-environments-with-nix,"<p>{rix} is an R package that provides functions to help you write Nix expressions: these expressions can then be used by the Nix package manager to build completely reproducible development environments. These environments can be used for interactive data analysis or running pipelines in a CI/CD environment. Environments built with Nix contain R and all the required packages that you need for your project: there are currently more than 80.000 pieces of software available through the Nix package manager, including the entirety of CRAN and Bioconductor packages. The Nix package manager is extremely powerful: it not only handles all the dependencies of any package extremely well, it is also possible with it to reproduce environments containing old releases of software. It is thus possible to build environments that contain R version 4.0.0 (for example) to run an old project originally developed on that version of R.</p>
<p>With Nix, it is essentially possible to replace {renv} and Docker combined. If you need other tools or languages like Python or Julia, this can also be done easily. Nix is available for Linux, macOS and Windows (via WSL2).</p>"
Running NLnet on NixOS,fosdem-2024-1692-running-nlnet-on-nixos,"<p>In this presentation, we explain how and why NLnet runs its systems on NixOS.
NLnet has grown from a small organization handling tens of grants per year to one that handles hundreds of grants per year. The number of funding proposals is more than five times as high. Still, NLnet runs mostly on Free Software. In the last years we have moved most of our systems to NixOS and keep our system setups in a single git repository handled with nixos-rebuild. In this presentation, we explain how and why we do so.</p>"
Clevis/Tang: unattended boot of an encrypted NixOS system,fosdem-2024-3044-clevis-tang-unattended-boot-of-an-encrypted-nixos-system,"<p>If you use, or want to use, full-disk encryption on your server, you might have been bothered by the problem of unattended reboots. <a href=""https://github.com/latchset/clevis"">Clevis</a> is a decryption framework which binds secrets against a secure resource (a secure cryptographic protocol to reach a remote <a href=""https://github.com/latchset/tang"">Tang</a> server or a TPM) to mount the root partition. Clevis is now part of NixOS, available in the initrd and can be set up declaratively for LUKS, ZFS and Bcachefs.</p>

The MDN Curriculum: Better web developers for a better web,fosdem-2024-1822-the-mdn-curriculum-better-web-developers-for-a-better-web,"<p>Building the web is becoming more complex, with more tools, techniques, and acronyms to digest. As a beginner, it can be a nightmare to figure out where to start. And with all this newfound complexity, knowledge has been lost on the way. Accessibility has taken a step backward, and the modern web feels a bit more ""cookie cutter"" than it perhaps did. How can we turn things around? In this talk, Chris Mills looks at the MDN Curriculum, a new blueprint for learning front-end fundamentals that aims to give new developers all they need to find a job and build a better, more accessible web.</p>"
Community Driven Data Collection and Consent in AI,fosdem-2024-1801-community-driven-data-collection-and-consent-in-ai,"<p>Generative AI in 2024 has a consent problem. Scraped and otherwise stolen datasets are used to produce output that can directly compete with the people who generated the source data. This doesn’t have to be our future. The Common Voice project collects volunteer donated speech data to freely offer academics, industry and language activists a future where meaningful linguistic diversity is built into the digital products and services that increasingly fill our world. By teaching computers the way that real people speak, Common Voice doesn’t just offer a better connected future for global users, but presents us with one possible consent led model for community driven data collection. Together, let’s explore how community led dataset collection, design and governance structures have developed across speech datasets and look at how freely donated data, data trusts and other consent led collection models could offer a less dystopian AI future.
An exploratory look at the proliferation of consent led data collection models in speech datasets, looking not only at Common Voice's CC0 donation-led approach but also looking into how data collection and governance models that offer more granular data control (like language community led data trusts) could offer AI and all of us touched by AI a less dystopian path into the future.</p>"

Multi-disciplinary geometry (libraries) in BIM and the IfcOpenShell software library,fosdem-2024-3072-multi-disciplinary-geometry-libraries-in-bim-and-the-ifcopenshell-software-library,"<p>The construction sector encompasses diverse disciplines, each operating on a unique perspective on the geometrical nature of built structures. This diversity often hampers effective information exchange within Building Information Modeling (BIM). </p>
<p>At the same time, it's worth noting that open-source CAD/CAM has limited options when it comes to available geometry libraries. In the latest version of IfcOpenShell, a combination of OpenCASCADE and CGAL is used to realize the best of both worlds in terms of performance, expressiveness and robustness. The presenter also uses voxelization and trees of halfspaces to cater to specific requirements.</p>
<p>This presentation describes challenges by various disciplines in the construction sector and explores solutions by leveraging a diverse ecosystem of open-source geometry libraries and discusses the benefits and challenges of a hybrid usage of geometry libraries.</p>"

<p>In this talk, I'll go into my motivation for starting the project, it's overall architecture, some noteworthy implementation details and my long-term plans for it.</p>"
Comprehensible Open Hardware: Building the Open Book,fosdem-2024-2913-comprehensible-open-hardware-building-the-open-book,"<p>We live in an era where technology, especially as shipped by large companies, can be an inscrutable black box to the end user. Your smart phone arrives in your life as a fully formed slab of glass and silicon: something meant to be used, but not understood. This kind of technology diminishes users' agency and disempowers them from using the technology on their own terms. </p>
<p>The Open Book is an open hardware e-book reader that can be built from scratch and understood, at least in broad strokes, by the average user. In this talk I'll walk through strategies that I've used when designing both the Open Book and other open hardware projects, to make objects that open themselves up not just to the developers that work on them, but to the users that work with them.</p>"

ngspice circuit simulator - stand-alone and embedded into KiCad,fosdem-2024-2834-ngspice-circuit-simulator-stand-alone-and-embedded-into-kicad,"<p>The talk will report on the current status and ongoing developments for ngspice.
There are a lot of enhancements for simulation during IC design:
New optional matrix solver KLU enables simulating circuits with &gt; 200k transistors and speeds-up simulation by more than 3x.
Verilog-A compact device models for modern devices (FinFET etc.) are supported.
Open-Source PDKs are supported (Skywater, GF, IHP, ASAP7 ...).
C-code may be embedded during simulation, as well as digital Verilog (compiled with Verilator).
The preferred user interface for IC design is XSCHEM.</p>
<p>On the discrete, PCB based simulation side the user interface for embedding ngspice into KiCad has made a large jump forward when looking at 7.99 (upcoming KiCad 8). 
Setting up simulations has been completely revised, new ways of evaluating simulation data are available. Besides the traditional sim setpus (op, dc, tran, noise etc.) now als IBIS (interface) simulation may be used.</p>
<p>Some simple live setups may show how to make use of this KiCad/ngspice interface.</p>"

They give you money. It should only be so simple, but it still isn't despite the many platforms, blogs, and advice on how to get paid for your open source work. In this talk, we will fundamentally explain the kinds of economic models of open source, including a basic taxonomy on types of funds and funders, special considerations and points of friction for open hardware, and how to unblock your projects and communities from funding challenges.</p>"
QUBIK a 1p PocketQube satellite platform,fosdem-2024-2019-qubik-a-1p-pocketqube-satellite-platform,"<p>The story of <strong>QUBIK</strong>, an OpenSource/OpenHardware PocketQube satellite. 
Ηow it came to be, challenges faced, its mission in space and its ongoing development as an experimentation and educational platform</p>"
A satellite's final safehouse: The deployer,fosdem-2024-2018-a-satellite-s-final-safehouse-the-deployer,"<p>What happens after a rocket achieves orbit? How does a satellite stay safe during launch and what happens after they leave their final home, right before starting their mission in orbit?
The answer is revealed during this talk.</p>
<p>PICOBUS, developed by the Libre Space Foundation, is an 8p PocketQube satellite deployer. It's a groundbreaking open-source deployer capable of storing and deploying up to 8 PocketQube Units while in orbit.</p>
<p>The first PICOBUS deployer was manufactured to fly onboard the maiden flight of Firefly Aerospace's Alpha rocket, carrying two sets of QUBIK satellites, which are our very own open-source PocketQube satellites.
The first launch faced a setback with an explosion shortly after liftoff, posing a threat to our deployer and satellites. However, an interesting turn of events followed! This will be discussed during this talk.</p>
<p>The second launch attempt on October 1, 2022, was a success. PICOBUS flawlessly deployed all the satellites into space, marking a significant achievement for the open-source community. It's a rare instance of open-source technology making it to orbit, which is quite remarkable.</p>
<p>Over the past year, Libre Space Foundation has been working on the second version of PICOBUS. This updated version is a more adaptable and lighter design, incorporating various advanced features and mechanisms to enhance its capabilities.</p>
<p>During this talk, we will discuss all about open source in space, the open source tools used to achieve that and the difficulties faced during this journey.</p>
<p>Our Vision is an Open and Accessible Outer Space for all. We believe that space should be claimed the libre (open source) way.
Our Mission is to promote, advance and develop libre (free and open source) technologies and knowledge for space. To do that we design, develop and deliver space related projects ranging from Ground Station equipment to global monitoring Networks and of course, satellites!</p>"
Electronic boards production automation with KiCAD scripts,fosdem-2024-2104-electronic-boards-production-automation-with-kicad-scripts,"<p>Designing electronics is always fun, the later mass production organisation is boring and routine work, and if you do not do it properly it can easily turn into a nightmare. 
The different machines used in production like printers, pick and place machines, ovens, AOI, testers all run different software, different libraries, different component naming concepts. So to prepare from your KiCad project all programs to run on these machines is really time consuming. Later on the machine jobs changeovers there are also source of machine operator errors.
We are dealing with electronic production for more than 30 years and we are constantly improving our process to avoid stupid mistakes and make the different machine programming easy and predictable process. 
KiCad scripting is nice tool to automate all this boring stuff and I will share our experience with you.</p>"
Jumpstarter: Open Hardware In The Loop for everybody,fosdem-2024-3070-jumpstarter-open-hardware-in-the-loop-for-everybody,"<p>In the world of cloud-based software, developers enjoy the advantage of <strong>fully automated testing</strong>. Continuous Integration (CI) systems check every software update, testing every part of the software. However, this level of automated testing hasn't been easy for embedded software and devices. The main reason is their <strong>dependence on specific physical hardware</strong>, which traditionally requires manual testing by a person. This manual approach is slow and becomes more challenging as the number of device variants grows.</p>
<p><strong><a href=""https://jumpstarter.dev"">Jumpstarter</a></strong> was created to help with that. It introduces <strong>a way to test embedded software automatically</strong>, just like cloud software. With Jumpstarter, we can test our software on the actual hardware it will run on, but without needing someone to manually handle the device for each test. This is a big step forward because it makes testing faster, more consistent, and less reliant on manual effort. <strong>It fits right into existing CI/CD systems</strong> like <em>GitHub CI</em>, <em>GitLab CI</em>, <em>Jenkins</em>, <em>Tekton</em>, <em>etc..</em>, making it easier for developers to include it in their workflow.</p>
<p>Testing in hardware requires a <strong>testing harness</strong> to connect your hardware to Jumpstarter, as we couldn't find anything readily available and Open; this is why we also created the <a href=""https://jumpstarter.dev/docs/testharness/jumpstarterboard/"">jumpstarter-board</a> that allows power control and metering, storage flashing, console access, and other functions. We are working on the release 2.0.0 with additional functionality and expandability. Additionally, the Jumpstarter software is designed with a <strong>driver architecture</strong> that enables the creation of drivers for additional testing harnesses.</p>
<p>This talk will explain how Jumpstarter makes embedded software testing easier and more efficient. We'll explain how it can save time and ensure better testing results, which is crucial for developing reliable embedded systems.</p>
<p>We will bring the Jumpstarter board with us and share details to let you build your own or get it built for you.</p>"
From hackathon idea to hackaday prize - How we make a Braille embosser.,fosdem-2024-3497-from-hackathon-idea-to-hackaday-prize-how-we-make-a-braille-embosser-,"<p>Making Braille documents for unsighted people has been a topic for a long time in makers movement. From BraillGO to Open Braille, many projects tried to produce Braille documents, with some success and some fails.
In 2016 My Human Kit, a french non profit organization organize a hackathon where they start with customized 3D printer and a piece a software that translate text into Braille and Braille into GCODE. 
In 2017 all these poc and tests was the start of the BrailleRAP project, bringing a fully documented open source Braille embosser with accessible software. Braille embosser succesfully re-built in many countries, from Argentina to Buthan, passing by France, Belgium and Cameroun.
From the first prototype in early 2018 to the lastest version in 2023, we will discuss about what failed and what was great improvments. We will focus on the documentation and assembly guide, one of the most important topic of the project.
At the end we will discuss about Workshop to build BrailleRAP. In most aspect, BrailleRAP is a Fablab standard workshop, with an exception, you need a Braille reader to validate the build. And most of Braille reader are unsighted ! Which opportunities  are open by building accessibility devices in workshop ?</p>"

The Old Remains New,fosdem-2024-2696-the-old-remains-new,"<p>Subtitle: Continuous Evolution Keeps 1960s Technology Alive</p>
<p>Short Abstract:</p>
<p>M is a conceptually simple language tightly coupled to a conceptually simple database. Originally developed in the mid to late 1960s, the technology has evolved to stay relevant in the 21st century. The talk reviews the history of the technology, the conceptual simplicity of both the M language and M database, and how the technology survives by evolving to adapt to the changing world of computing. Portability was a goal since its earliest days.</p>
<p>Longer Description:</p>
<p>M first ran on a PDP-7 and was a complete software stack: an operating system, a database, and a language. To run on such limited hardware, M seamlessly coupled a minimalistic database with a minimalistic language. It was based on a small number of concepts.</p>
<p>Fast forward more than a half century. While M is not mainstream software technology, it is the language and database of the largest real-time core-banking and electronic medical record systems. For example, a nation-scale medical record system in Jordan runs a complete FOSS stack developed in M. To robustly and securely serve such large-scale, mission-critical systems that require ""five nines"" availability, M has retained its core principles of a minimalistic language and efficient implementation, which allows it to scale down as well as up: the YottaDB implementation of M delivers thousands of database accesses per second even on a Raspberry Pi Zero with a consumer grade MicroSD card.</p>
<p>To remain relevant with changing economics and technology, M had to evolve. It moved from days when the cost of the hardware dominated, programmers were economical, and software was freely bundled with the hardware, to today. It has done so without compromising its foundational values. It ceased to be an operating system as it was ported to other computing platforms. A production grade implementation was released under a copyleft license in 2000/2001. While the M language retains its conceptual simplicity, the tight coupling of M, the language, with M, the database, now extends to other languages, C, Go, JavaScript, Lua, Perl, PHP, Python, and Rust. The talk will use examples from lua-yottadb, which tightly binds a highly capable minimalistic language and a highly capable minimalistic database.</p>

For Want of Anneal: Examining The Unseen Changes Concerning Changes To VCS Assets and The Need For More Graph Centric Approaches,fosdem-2024-2747-for-want-of-anneal-examining-the-unseen-changes-concerning-changes-to-vcs-assets-and-the-need-for-more-graph-centric-approaches,"<p>The behaviour of repos over time will be examined from the perspective of semantic graphs and qualifying annotations.
The focus will not only be concerning direct diffs within a specific commit but emphasizing greater contextualization of what was taking place.
For example, understanding the relationship of a commit in the context of a project's sections; functionality; or symbiotic repos.</p>
<p>Through the use of logic programming (SWI-Prolog) and the useful of (RDF) principles, demonstrations will include:
* How historic changes to files in a VCS should not be treated as logs of affect but additionally as components for adapting other coding and knowledge assets;
* How failure to preemptively describe the desired outcomes from a successful commit mean that there is a failure to provide preparatory automation behaviours.</p>
<p>The aforementioned logic programming and RDF expositions will demonstrate the evolution of the (historically NLNet funded) project Icebreaker.
It shall be mixing its parsing syntaxes from seperate projects (kanban boards and knowledge-management with syntaxes for time series analyses of repos).
There will be a showing of how task management; documentation; and coding intersect using perspectives from how annotations from the ""Recursive-Modelling-Language"" Qiuy intersect over time.</p>
<p>Anybody who has lost an afternoon because of a 1 character mistake in their coding understands the grim insights from the proverb ""For Want of a Nail"".
However, for non coding activities such errors or omittances are more subtle, as the fallout from things tends to be less direct (such as for lost capacity, imprecision or diminished returns).
To return to the proverb, the nail is the instigator of a chain of events, rather than a technical or procedural.
People are unlikely to posit ""For Want of Annealing"" to highlight the pernicious effects of qualified deficiencies.
The consequence of this presentation will be to demonstrate how underutilized qualitative and graph orientated approaches are for modern project management.</p>"
How to create the universal operating system,fosdem-2024-1872-how-to-create-the-universal-operating-system,"<p>We foresee, moving into the future, the need to be able to
connect anything and everything.  This will lead to a scale of things
that will become incomprehensible by mere mortals if we apply current
day approaches.  The main reasons for the predicted
incomprehensibility are: combinatory logic complexities, further
conflated by state and concurrency.  In this talk I will discuss the
different ingredients of the Dezyne language that aim to dispel these,
among which is the formal basis for the language expressed in the

How much math can you fit in 700K?,fosdem-2024-1990-how-much-math-can-you-fit-in-700k-,"<p>Last year, I presented DB48X, an open-source firmware for the DM42 and DM32 calculators from SwissMicros (https://archive.fosdem.org/2023/schedule/event/reversepolishlisp). The goal is to create the best scientific programmable calculator for engineers, based on (and improving upon) the user experience of calculators such as the HP48 series.</p>
<p>The DM42 has a serious limitation: there is about 700K of available flash space for the program, and about 70K of available RAM. So the question is: how much math can we fit in 700K.</p>
<p>This year, I would like to demonstrate what already works, including support for:
* big integers
* based numbers
* complex numbers
* vectors and matrices
* symbolic computations
* integration and differentiation
* engineering units
* plots and charts
* data processing
* RPL programming and debugging</p>

Self-hosting and autonomy using guix-forge,fosdem-2024-2560-self-hosting-and-autonomy-using-guix-forge,"<p>As free software programmers, whether we like it or not, we often host our projects on large centralized and proprietary software forges such as GitHub. In theory, it is perfectly possible to host our own forges using free software such as GitLab, Gitea, etc. But, life is short, and setup and maintenance of these services is more work than it seems at first.</p>
<p>GNU Guix is well-known as a package manager, for the high quality of its packages, and for the strong reproducibility guarantees it provides. But, it is much less appreciated for its services, system definitions and deployment features. That's such a shame since these features can let you summon and dismiss entire systems at will—be they bare-metal or virtualized—with nothing but a declarative plain text configuration file.</p>
<p>In this talk, I will speak about guix-forge, a Guix channel that provides Guix services for easy setup and maintenance of a software forge. guix-forge uses existing free software such as cgit and/or klaus for serving git repositories on the web, laminar and webhook for continuous integration, uacme for managing TLS certificates, etc.</p>"

Five years of Teal: minimalism versus growth in language design,fosdem-2024-2564-five-years-of-teal-minimalism-versus-growth-in-language-design,"<p>Teal is a typed dialect of Lua whose genesis was chronicled in three talks at this devroom: ""Minimalism versus types"" (2019), ""Minimalistic typed Lua is here"" (2020) and ""What's Next for Teal"" (2021). From a being just a wild idea back in 2019, the language has grown into a small community of users (roughly measured by its ~1.8k GitHub stars). With growth, the language's strengths and weaknesses became more evident, and with those come feature requests. How to keep the language small and still address the needs of users, while remaining faithful to the spirit of Lua and not falling into pitfalls from the past? In this talk we'll discuss some pragmatic choices in Teal's design that were made to balance those concerns: to make it more powerful, while keeping it small.</p>"

Let's talk Matrix between Governments and Citizens,fosdem-2024-2817-let-s-talk-matrix-between-governments-and-citizens,"<p>Large companies in the IT and banking industry typically build their own custom apps to communicate with their customers, often storing unencrypted customer data on their backend servers.</p>
<p>While it may be acceptable for companies to store data in unencrypted form on a company's server, governments have a greater responsibility for their citizens' data.</p>
<p>You are free to use private sector offers or not. In contrast, public administration has a de facto monopoly on many services that require social, medical and other information that is vulnerable to stigmatization.</p>
<p>Some governments have created their own custom-built solutions where communication takes place via insecure services with no end-to-end-encryption in place.</p>
<p>The German identity system BundID, for example, contains a communication component that stores unencrypted messages on central servers. This poses a major risk to privacy in the event of IT security incidents.</p>
<p>If all goes well, Germany's infrastructure might get an upgrade and will use Matrix as its new communication protocol in the future (see https://gitlab.opencode.de/fitko/rueckkanal-ueber-messengerdienste)</p>

<p>While matrix is an instant messaging system it still stores all events. To empower a vision where matrix can truly be used to develop any real-time experience, one must develop a client and leverage it on all parts. This process splits matrix into events stored in the DAG, allowing for asynchronous communication and collaboration, as well as low-latency synchronized communication.</p>
<p>To realize this, matrix needs a standardized signaling system for establishing real time (WebRTC) connections between all participants and allow to exchange media and data streams.</p>

[Protocols] Security of STARTTLS in the E-Mail Context,fosdem-2024-2179--protocols-security-of-starttls-in-the-e-mail-context,"<p>TLS is one of today's most widely used and best-analyzed encryption technologies. However, for historical reasons, TLS for email protocols is often not used directly but negotiated via STARTTLS. This additional negotiation added complexity and was prone to security vulnerabilities such as naive STARTTLS stripping or command injection attacks in the past.</p>
<p>We performed the first structured analysis of STARTTLS in SMTP, POP3, and IMAP and introduced a semi-automatic testing toolkit (EAST) to analyze email clients. We used EAST to analyze 28 email clients and 23 email servers, resulting in over 40 STARTTLS related issues. Only 3 out of 28 clients and 7 out of 23 servers did not show any STARTTLS-specific security issues. We conclude that STARTTLS is error-prone to implement, under-specified in the standards, and should be avoided.</p>"
"[Protocols] An introduction to IMAP, type-driven development, and imap-codec",fosdem-2024-2111--protocols-an-introduction-to-imap-type-driven-development-and-imap-codec,"<p>This talk recapitulates what I learned about IMAP and type-driven development while working on imap-types and imap-codec -- two misuse-resistant Rust libraries. I will also explain how imap-codec was funded and hopefully motivate people to ask for funding for their loved open-source projects.</p>
<p>IMAP is a lot. It's a stateful protocol that doesn't lend itself to a simple implementation and can be intimidating to someone who is used to HTTP. IMAP's syntax is branched, subtle, and has various issues. It doesn't help either that there are more than 70 extensions, with any of them potentially breaking your understanding of how IMAP operates.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, IMAP is (still) the only widely supported open standard for email management. It's probably also an underappreciated protocol whose ideas are only ""re-discovered"" today. Knowing its features and shortcomings will improve your understanding of modern protocols like JMAP, too, paving the way for a worthy successor.</p>
<p>After the talk, you will have a much better understanding of IMAP, understand the design decisions behind imap-types and imap-codec, have a better feeling for the (dis)advantages of type-driven development, and, who knows, be motivated to help out to improve the status quo of email management!</p>

[JMAP] JMAP: Getting Started,fosdem-2024-2135--jmap-jmap-getting-started,"<p>JMAP (RFC 8620, 8261, &amp;c.) is a new protocol meant to replace IMAP, CalDAV, CardDAV, and to handle more kinds of data in the future.  It keeps the most important technical properties of those protocols, but ditches many things that hold back improvements and hamper developers.  It's built on commonly understood and implemented standards, which makes it easy to get up and running and easy to benefit from modern systems like push notifications.  It's built as a syncing protocol, providing easy sync features in a data agnostic way.</p>

With the help of many open source tools, from Dovecot to Postfix and many more, a revolutionary open source groupware was born. On top of the classic open source stack, we implemented APIs and protocols of Microsoft's Exchange (and later MS 365 server) in free, opensource versions, one by one. 
This way, we built a ""drop-in""-replacement for MS Exchange that supports unmodified, plugin-free clients with Outlook, Android, Apple and Web clients, all out of the box. And it comes with chat, video conferences, file sync, administration, domain, user and account management and much more. Most recently we implemented Exchange Web services.<br />
In this talk, we will have a look at how we re-implemented the protocols and how it works with clients.  We'll talk about problems, solutions and quirks of our work and the challenges of both supporting many older versions and following Microsoft's newest developments.
Our support for Microsoft Exchange (and other) protocols follows the protocol specifications of EWS, EAS (Exchange ActiveSync), RPCH, MAPI/HTTP (NSPI, OXCFXICS, OXDSCLI and many others)</p>"

[Security] Modern chat-mail for security-sensitive helplines,fosdem-2024-2780--security-modern-chat-mail-for-security-sensitive-helplines,"<p>Helplines and NGOs working with sensitive populations in at-risk areas require a robust, secure but also usable communication tooling. They need to have a system that lets anyone contact them in a secure and pseudonymous way, without revealing who manages the hotline; they also need to be able to organize their internal workflow securely and safely enroll new members.</p>
<p>We have conducted a user survey among grassroots helplines in Eastern Europe and identified several common traits: first, they rely on a patchwork of tools (messaging apps, cloud storage, task trackers) therefore multiplying potential vulnerabilities; second, they are critical towards popular secure messaging apps that either leak your phone numbers (e.g. Signal), or do not guarantee end-to-end encryption (e.g. Telegram) or may seem tricky to onboard for non-techies (e.g. Element). </p>
<p>What we propose is a chat-mail service using Delta Chat messaging suite, adapted specifically for hotlines and NGOs. Delta Chat is a federated, crossplatform, free and open source messaging app that works over email and offers state of the art end-to-end encryption using Autocrypt and SecureJoin with multiple audits.</p>

Consequently, vendors should incorporate several layers of security to ensure users' individual privacy. A typical solution is to protect data <em>at rest</em> by using encryption. To protect data <em>in use</em>, however, encryption is often considered impractical: encrypting and decrypting data at runtime incurs a significant computational overhead.</p>
<p>As a remedy, there exist Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) that enable database developers to wrap computations in a protected area of the disk. However, the adoption of Open Source software employing TEE to protect data in use is not sufficiently widespread, and such technologies are mostly limited to prototypes. In addition, existing database implementations incorporating TEEs face significant performance issues due to the pitfalls and limitations of Intel SGX, the most commonly used architecture. </p>
<p>In this talk, we present the current state of Open Source secure database implementations using TEEs. We will highlight the strengths and weaknesses of widely-known systems (SGX_SQLite, StealthDB, DuckDB) and discuss design choices developers face when using TEEs to secure data.

Reproducible builds for confidential computing: Why remote attestation is worthless without it,fosdem-2024-1769-reproducible-builds-for-confidential-computing-why-remote-attestation-is-worthless-without-it,"<p>A key component of Confidential Computing is the validation of TCB measurements using remote attestation.
Validating these measurements requires a set of trusted reference values. But where do these opaque values come from? Today, they are often provided by a third party, without mechanisms for auditing the trustworthiness or origin of reference values.
We want to make CC offerings auditable, allowing end users to read the source code, reproduce binary artifacts, generate reference values from the artifacts and verify the deployed system (using remote attestation). Every part of the TCB needs to be open source and reproducible.
We will cover the status quo of how reference values are used in CC. We show what the main difficulties and sources of non-determinism are.
Based on a minimal open source example, we explain how we build fully reproducible OS images with mkosi and nix - all the way from source code in Git to the reference values for remote attestation. The presented code is the base for images used in both <a href=""https://github.com/edgelesssys/constellation"">Constellation</a> and the <a href=""https://github.com/confidential-containers/confidential-containers"">Confidential Containers project</a>.</p>"
Increasing Trust and Preserving Privacy: Advancing Remote Attestation,fosdem-2024-2265-increasing-trust-and-preserving-privacy-advancing-remote-attestation,"<p>The growing trend towards confidential computing has presented a significant challenge: making remote attestation, a crucial technology for establishing trust in confidential workloads, easily accessible to application developers. Ideally, leveraging the added transparency and security guarantees of attestation as an authentication mechanism should be simple. However, the current ecosystem often requires engineers to integrate remote attestation at the application layer of the network stack. This task is not only burdensome, diverting attention from core business logic, but also poses privacy risks. Developers are compelled to navigate a complex maze of security protocols, with the ever-present danger of accidentally exposing sensitive information about the devices running these workloads.</p>
<p>Developing secure and easy-to-use building blocks requires a collaborative effort between the open-source and standards communities. The IETF is working on various specifications, which are being complemented by prototypes and formal verification of innovative features. Several Internet protocols, such as TLS, OAuth, ACME, Netconf, and CSR/EST, are already incorporating attestation, and others will follow. 
A key focus of our work is to integrate privacy-preserving techniques that can mitigate the risks inherent in remote attestation, ensuring that this crucial technology can be utilized in a manner that is both user-friendly and privacy-conscious.</p>
<p>In this presentation, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the current standardization and open-source implementation initiatives. The goal is to make it easier for the broader community to access and engage in this new development, which is crucial for the advancement of the remote attestation infrastructure in general and the utilization of confidential computing in particular.</p>"

CONFEDSS: Concolic execution and the puzzling practice of peripheral emulation,fosdem-2024-2247-confedss-concolic-execution-and-the-puzzling-practice-of-peripheral-emulation,"<p>One of the tasks at the device forensics team of the Netherlands Forensic Institute is the reverse engineering of soft- and hardware devices for the judicial system. This task spans a lot of different abstractions in the IT ecosystem, from network protocols, to filesystems, encryption algorithms etc. One very active topic of research is the reverse engineering of low level firmware. This topic proves to be quite a bit more difficult than a lot of others on the list.</p>
<p>One of the big challenges in the reverse engineering of low-level firmware is the lack of hardware abstractions and known interfaces (e.g. syscall interfaces and libraries with known exported functions). Furthermore, this type of firmware is oftentimes found in on-die ROM, which provides a good incentive to keep it's size small, as this type of memory can be expensive. This usually means there is not a lot of space for (debug) strings either. </p>
<p>These factors making static reverse engineering quite a tough challenge, which in turn makes dynamic reversing more attractive. However, this is not an easy task. The lack of hardware abstractions and the presence of memory-mapped peripherals makes emulation no small feat. Outside of some OSINT and cross-referencing, the best one can do is guess at the working of some of these unknown peripherals. But is there a smarter way of guessing? </p>

This project aims to make it easier for reverse engineers to dynamically reverse low-level firmware by emulating it and using dynamic state selection as an approach to peripheral simulation. We will give a detailed insight into the problems usually encountered with low-level emulation and show it's workings with a live demo, which will hopefully inspire you to use it the next time you want to emulate some BIOS logic for exotic hardware or find where that weird driver quirk comes from.</p>"
Breathing Life into Legacy: An Open-Source Emulator of Legacy Apple Devices,fosdem-2024-2826-breathing-life-into-legacy-an-open-source-emulator-of-legacy-apple-devices,"<p>This talk presents QEMU-iOS, an open-source emulator of legacy Apple devices. I outline the process of emulating an iPod Touch 2G, discussing the technical challenges and reverse engineering methodologies applied. The talk starts with an overview of the project's goals and then outlines the reverse engineering process, utilizing tools like Ghidra for disassembling the Apple bootloader, XNU kernel, and other binaries. Then, I describe QEMU, a popular framework for emulation, and show how essential iPod Touch peripherals such as the touchscreen, storage, and display have been implemented. Finally, this talk touches upon the implications of open-sourcing this project, its contribution to the emulation and reverse engineering landscape, and its potential for future efforts to emulate newer Apple devices.</p>"
Arm64EC: Microsoft's emulation Frankenstein,fosdem-2024-1762-arm64ec-microsoft-s-emulation-frankenstein,"<p>Arm64EC (""Emulation Compatible"") is Microsoft's latest answer to emulating x86_64 on arm64, allowing code from both architectures to coexist in a single address space, so that an application can be <em>incrementally</em> ported from x86_64 to arm64. I'll cover what Arm64EC is, postulate on why it is the way it is, and lessons learnt from porting LuaJIT to it.
What if there was a CPU (and associated C toolchain) capable of executing both x86_64 and arm64 instructions, cheaply switching back and forth at any function call boundary? While there isn't such a thing, Arm64EC emulates such a CPU - any x86_64 code is emulated, and any arm64 code needs to contort itself slightly to allow cheap switching in to and out of the emulator. The result is something of an emulation Frankenstein, but <em>just maybe</em> it'll help adoption of Windows on arm64.</p>
<p>Speaking about a Windows feature at an open source event might seem initially odd, but things can be intellectually interesting regardless of origin, and open source tooling such as Wine and LLVM have started to add some support for it, and open source developers might want to port their applications to it (as I have done for LuaJIT).</p>

While the Intel 4004 was the first commercial microprocessor, the TMS 1000 for Texas Instruments was the first widely available microcontroller embedding CPU, RAM and ROM for a mere 2$. Millions of units of this family were deployed in many calculators and handheld games. This talk will have a retrospective look at this piece of history based on an Harvard architecture. We will first analyse the die, especially how to visually decode its rom content and disassemble it. Then we will have a look at its instruction set and look at the coding of some basic operations found in early calculators, including ""reversed"" calculators such as the famous little professor and other handheld games of this time. We will show this in action using the Mame emulator and have a look at how Mame handles the TMS 1000 (including some specific display or input controls, e.g. Merlin). Last but not last, you will discover and be able to play with our Big Professor A3 version based on an Arduino Nano, LED matrix and 3D printing !</p>"

Running DOS & Unix on an 8-bit Commodore,fosdem-2024-2334-running-dos-unix-on-an-8-bit-commodore,"<p>In 1983, Commodore introduced CBM-II, the successor to their aging line of PET business computers. It featured a 6502 CPU running at 2 MHz and up to 256 kB memory. But its most interesting feature was a second CPU interface, which (much like Acorn's Tube) allowed to attach various CPUs to the system.</p>
<p>Commodore designed two cards: Z80 (for running CP/M) and 8088 (for running MS-DOS). Back in these days, though, MS-DOS had a separate version for each platform. Therefore you could only run specially crafted Commodore MS-DOS 1.25 on the computer, because it was obviously not PC-compatible.</p>
<p>A few years ago I set out to fix this deficiency. I asked myself: is it possible to make the platform (more) PC compatible? As it turns out, it is, and practically without any modifications to the original design. You just need to write a piece of software that emulates the PC BIOS and some parts of the PC hardware platform. For this, one wire needs to be added to the hardware, which generates a NMI when an I/O chip is accessed; the emulation software then simulates the non-existing I/O peripheral.</p>
<p>Based on this work, I was able to make the platform compatible enough to run modern FreeDOS, as well as other PC software: Norton Commander, Turbo Pascal, QBASIC and more.</p>
<p>As a follow-up, I designed a Z8000 processor card using the second CPU interface; this card is meant to emulate the abandoned Commodore 900 Unix workstation. This is a work in progress right now; so far the card is able to boot the Commodore 900 BIOS and complete the I/O chip self test (the I/O chips are obviously also emulated in software). By the time of the talk, the progress is expected to be much farther :)</p>

A Game Boy and his cellphone,fosdem-2024-1718-a-game-boy-and-his-cellphone,"<p>The Mobile Adapter GB was a peripheral that allowed you to connect a Game Boy to a Mobile Phone, with the purpose of facilitating Internet connectivity and multiplayer. Unbeknownst to many, this was the first time big-name games like Pokémon and Mario Kart had any sort of online connectivity. However, the adapter was a flop, and it never left Japan. Now, 20 years later, the REON team is documenting and restoring the system, across the whole stack, from hardware to backend.</p>
<p>This talk will start by covering what the Mobile Adapter GB is, and what REON is doing to restore its functionalities on both software emulators and hardware devices. Then, the discussion will delve into the details by brushing a bit on the peripheral's history, and what it's used for in different games. Finally, the presentation will end with an exploration of how the actual system works: this will help emulator developers understand how to implement the adapter, and it will also show prospective homebrew developers the peripheral's capabilities.</p>

But the Sanco 8003 is a French/Japanese computer for which we found no documentation at all, as of 2023: nothing about the hardware, nothing about the software, just a few hints that it has a Z80 and can run the famous CP/M operating system.
There are some amateurs here and there, but we virtually found no ""hard scene"" for this computer.</p>
<p>In this talk, we are going to describe our journey in documenting this computer.
We will show how we tore it apart, how we dumped the ROMs, how we leveraged some self-built custom hardware tools, how we followed the traces on the circuit board, how we understood the 74xx logic gates, how we disassembled the ROM and patched it to run our custom bootloader, how we experimented with sideloaded assembly to confirm (or deny) the expectations we thought of by looking at the reconstructed schematics, and, eventually, how we wrote our own emulator.</p>

Controlling a 6 degree Robot Arm using a 48K ZX Spectrum,fosdem-2024-2898-controlling-a-6-degree-robot-arm-using-a-48k-zx-spectrum,"<p>Controlling a Robot Arm, requires some form of interface. In this case, the Lab-Volt Robot arm used implements a private protocol over RS232 serial communication. Hence a new hardware interface board was designed and built to be able to communicate by RS232, which included a ""driver"" layer (in assembly) that was properly integrated with the Spectrum ROM advanced Channels/Streams concept/feature, allowing the RS232 to be used transparently from BASIC language.
The Robot protocol was reverse engineered and a BASIC application implemented to follow the protocol to allow movement of the Robot Arm.
A new Module was also added to the robot, to provide a pneumatic end effector that provides for faster interaction with objects with a flat surface were suction can work effectively.</p>"

Standardizing the generation and signing of boot images,fosdem-2024-3067-standardizing-the-generation-and-signing-of-boot-images,"<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>This presentation will talk about how SoCs can leverage Binman to simplify the overall boot-loader build flow. We use Texas Instruments (TI) K3 family of SoCs as an example, which, like many other SoCs today, use custom tools to build and sign their boot-loader binaries. However, U-Boot contains a powerful and flexible packaging tool Binman and this can be extended to sign and package even complex boot-loader images.</p>
<p>The session outlines the challenges in maintaining and shipping custom tools for any sort of build, highlighting its limitations in scaling, maintaining consistency and accommodating evolving system requirements. This presentation shows the effort in leveraging Binman, moving towards a completely open-source solution that also simplifies the build using K3 devices as an example. We also aim to present how we can make Binman the standard when it comes to the developing boot-loaders for any OS. A few platforms such as Kontron i.MX8M and Renesas RZ/N1 already use Binman to package their boot-loader binaries but we see that there is a larger scope of pulling all platform packaging to the standard.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>The boot loader images involved in booting a TI K3 device to Linux are:
- tiboot3.bin: containing SPL (Secondary Program Loader) for the R5 core, may include system firmware for certain devices
- sysfw.itb: containing system firmware and board configuration binaries
- u-boot.img: containing the U-Boot image that can load the final Linux kernel image</p>
<p>In addition to the complexity of the <a href=""https://u-boot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/board/ti/k3.html#boot-flow-overview"">K3 boot flow</a>, each boot-loader image is packaged differently according to the whether the device:
- is a High-Security Field Securable (HS-FS), High-Security Enforced (HS-SE) or General Purpose (GP)
- follows Combined or Legacy boot flow
- contains system firmware (SYSFW) split into Texas Instruments Foundational Security (TIFS) and Device Manager (DM) or not split</p>
<p>This leads to four similar yet unique <a href=""https://u-boot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/board/ti/k3.html#boot-flow-variations"">boot flows</a>. Since the image must account for a combination of the three choices, packaging the boot-loader is a complex process that involves signing as well.</p>
<p>This was earlier achieved using TI custom solution repositories, k3-image-gen and core-secdev-k3. k3-image-gen was responsible for generating and packaging board configuration data and system firmware binaries into tiboot3.bin or sysfw.itb while core-secdev-k3 was used for signing the required binaries in the case of HS devices. The flow looked like <a href=""https://github.com/nehamalcom/migration-binman/blob/main/boot-flow-before-binman.drawio.png"">this</a>.</p>
<p>The upstreaming effort proposed a flow that embedded the functionalities of k3-image-gen and core-secdev-k3 using Binman shown <a href=""https://github.com/nehamalcom/migration-binman/blob/main/boot-flow-after-binman.drawio.png"">here</a>.</p>
<p>Now by migrating the boot-loader generation to Binman, complex shell scripts that stitched boot images together are no longer needed. Instead, the generation is standardized to creation using the binman node in the DTS, for example:
<code>tiboot3 {
    filename = ""tiboot3.bin"";
    ti-secure-rom {
        content = &lt;&amp;u_boot_spl&gt;, &lt;fw1&gt;, &lt;fw2&gt; ...;
        keyfile = ""key.pem"";
        load = &lt;LOAD_ADDR&gt;;
        load-fw1 = &lt;LOAD_ADDR_FW1&gt;;
        load-fw2 = &lt;LOAD_ADDR_FW2&gt;;
        ...
    };
    u_boot_spl: u-boot-spl {
    };
    fw1: fw1 {
        filename = fw1.bin;
    };
    fw2: fw2 {
        filename = fw2.bin;
    };
    ...
};</code>
An example of a proper application of the Binman node for K3 devices can be seen <a href=""https://source.denx.de/u-boot/u-boot/-/blob/master/arch/arm/dts/k3-j721e-binman.dtsi"">here</a>.

<p>This presentation will provide an overview of the tool, understanding how to migrate your custom tools and platforms to Binman with K3 as an example and finally discuss current challenges and limitations while expanding to other platforms in U-Boot. Attendees will obtain insights into a practical implementation of Binman, its integration within existing workflows and best practices to leverage this tool to optimize U-Boot boot-loader development.</p>"

Kernel command line to configure userspace considered harmful,fosdem-2024-3309-kernel-command-line-to-configure-userspace-considered-harmful,"<p>There was a time when we were happy and care free, and booting our computers off
a floppy disk found behind the pub down the road was an exciting and joyful adventure.
Alas, those days are past now. Significant effort and investment have gone into
securing the boot process of a general purpose PC, and we are nowhere near done.
Linux is trailing significantly behind Windows and MacOS in this regard, and we
have a long way to go. With TPM support in UKIs, systemd-stub and systemd-boot,
the systemd project is trying to do its part in bringing the ecosystem forward.</p>
<p>But we need to talk about the kernel command line. Decades of [over|ab]use have
made it into a kitchen sink, used to do anything and everything, and (custom)
parsed by everything and anything, including the kernel before ExitBootServices()
has been called. The surface attack that opens up for an authenticated writer is
unfathomable, and the magnitude of a successful exploitation is simply unknowable.
Is it time for the kernel command line to end?</p>
<p>This talk will explore alternatives to let users configure early initrd/userspace
services provided by the systemd project, and plead with anybody willing to listen
to start using those instead: UKIs, signed addons for UKIs, signed Confext/Sysext

<p>While investment in AI compliance and strategy continues to grow, numerous layoffs of open source talent are happening within organizations. This talk aims to explore the critical role of open source talent in providing stewardship and building bridges between an organization's AI strategy and its critical (open source projects) infrastructure. The talk will also highlight the risks to the software (and AI) supply chain arising from inadequate support for open source communities, potentially creating vulnerabilities in the entire ecosystem.</p>"
"Open Source in 2024: boundaries, burnout, business",fosdem-2024-2029-open-source-in-2024-boundaries-burnout-business,"<p>In this talk I will discuss how maintainers and contributors can enforce and respect boundaries, avoid and heal from burnout and how the ""business"" aspects of open source software e.g. open source businesses, raising funds, joining a non-profit/fiscal host can be done and help the project.</p>
<p>This will be done on the backdrop of my experiences maintaining Homebrew and, until recently, working on open source at GitHub and, now, trying to build a business around commercialising some aspects of my open source work.</p>"
Where are the limits of open communities?,fosdem-2024-1690-where-are-the-limits-of-open-communities-,"<p>Being an open organization or open community has many benefits, described countless times. Even some risks, mostly cultural, are sometimes being mentioned. But let's take a look at what questions (or risks) an open approach may carry.
- What does being an open community actually mean in practice?
- How to set up communication in the community that is both open and effective?
- How to ensure information security in an open community?</p>
<p>In the <a href=""https://cesko.digital/"">Česko.Digital</a> community, we have more than 6000 members from various areas. There are volunteers, people from non-profits or public administration, representatives of partner organizations, supporters, and more. Since the beginning, we have built our community on open principles in many aspects of our functioning. However, we have reached a point where we are running into the possible limits of this approach. In the past months, we have been looking for answers (not only) to the questions stated above, and I would like to share with you the insights from our journey.</p>"
The State of Funding Free & Open Source Software,fosdem-2024-2751-the-state-of-funding-free-open-source-software,"<p>Join me in taking a look at the current state of free and open source software funding, what the potential paths to financial sustainability currently look like for maintainers, and what new models are being explored. </p>
<ul>
<li>What options do projects have when looking to be financially sustainable long-term?</li>
<li>What organizations are funding free and open source software, and how do they allocate it?</li>
<li>What does it looks like to have funding that isn't subject to unstable corporate budgets and interests? </li>
<li>What’s missing from our current models of funding? </li>
</ul>
<p>I’ll include info from some of the top Open Source Program Offices currently funding corporate dependencies; government-funded initiatives aimed at sustaining digital public goods we all rely on; and user-sustained projects that rely on the goodwill of individuals. We’ll touch on what place Accelerators and Grants have in this, and peeling away the growth-curve expectations from investors who may, or may not, understand the needs of free and open source. </p>
<p>Let’s start 2024 with the crucial question: how do we ensure the software our societies depend on is sustainable long-term?</p>"
The Many Hats of a Maintainer: Organization Design That Helps Reduce Them,fosdem-2024-2581-the-many-hats-of-a-maintainer-organization-design-that-helps-reduce-them,"<p>We’ve heard it for decades - being an open source maintainer is full-time job in itself. Writing features and maintaining the project are expected, but a project needs more than good features to create a robust community around it. Open source organizational design is usually an after thought but it doesn’t have to be. Taking the time to define those “hats” early on can help a project grow and be sustainable enough to not rely on a few maintainers to do it all. In this session, Paris Pittman will share her experience helping maintainers avoid burnout, handle governance operations, increase adopters and users, and building plans for community. </p>
<p>Is moderating your mailing list or chat platform something you want to do for the duration of the project as a lead maintainer? What about creating and writing all of the onboarding materials needed for contributors and users alike? In this session, we will draw from open source projects like Kubernetes, Swift, and others so that audience members will take away an action plan on building out intentional community roles, groups, and more so the many hats of maintainers are shared.</p>"
Solving community problems with documentation,fosdem-2024-2136-solving-community-problems-with-documentation,"<p>Community problems come in many shapes and sizes, but at the root most community problems are communication problems. One way to solve communication problems is through improved documentation. In this talk, we'll walk through how projects participating in Google's Season of Docs program have framed their problems, hypothesized solutions, created documentation to solve those problems, and measured the success of their documentation.</p>"
Open practices for open projects,fosdem-2024-1653-open-practices-for-open-projects,"<p>The Open Practice Library is filled with useful stuff. Stuff that helps people work together better, build the right thing, and build the thing right. In this session we'll gather ideas and issues from participants, and design potential solutions and pathways together using the Mobius Loop, and the library of open practices.  It should be fun, come along!</p>"
Kickstarting an Open Source Culture: A Guide for Mentors,fosdem-2024-2105-kickstarting-an-open-source-culture-a-guide-for-mentors,"<p>Many companies are understanding the value of having open source contributors and maintainers within their ranks. Growing that open source culture internally is not quite as easy as simply hiring developers to “work on open source” and pointing them at a GitHub repository. Martin and Phil both became open source contributors and, ultimately, maintainers in the past decade with the support of company efforts to increase contributors. They both learned a lot of open source lessons along the way and are taking that knowledge into leadership and specific mentoring roles at IBM and AWS today.</p>
<p>In this talk, Martin and Phil will provide guidance for both employees and technical leaders who are looking to invest in growing an open source culture where they work. We’ll help detail the ways that open source investment is valuable both for the company and for the employee’s own vitality and career advancement. We’ll share how our own open source journeys have unlocked career opportunities that may have been unavailable to us before, and how we are investing in others through various programs and career mentoring at our respective companies today.</p>"
The Good Governance Handbook: Enabling good OSS usage through OSPOs,fosdem-2024-2685-the-good-governance-handbook-enabling-good-oss-usage-through-ospos,"<p>OSPOs (Open Source Program Offices) are on the rise: from private companies, to public administrations and academia, organisations now often have someone or a team dedicated to open source topics. The idea behind an OSPO is not only to secure open source assets; it's also about being a good citizen, contributing back, and become an active part of the community and ecosystem. </p>
<p>The OSPO Alliance published in 2021 the first version of the <a href=""https://ospo-alliance.org/ggi"">Good Governance Handbook</a>, a method and framework to help organisations define and build their OSPO. It proposes a list of 25 good practices, from identification of open source assets to HR contracts and community participation, all packed with practical advice and resources from experienced practitioners. We also provide a deployment feature to start your own OSPO in <a href=""https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2023/01/30/how-start-ospo-ten-minutes-using-gitlab/"">less than 10mn</a> using GitLab.</p>
<p>During this session, we will present the latest version of the GGI Handbook (v1.2), how it helps both organisations and the open source community, and start a discussion about how we can help them -- public sector, academia, NGOs, private orgs.. -- become better citizens, adopt good practices and contribute back to our ecosystem.</p>"
Building an Open Source Community One Friend at a Time,fosdem-2024-2776-building-an-open-source-community-one-friend-at-a-time,"<p>In open source, we talk a lot about the importance of community, but community isn’t something that happens by accident. Drawing on the speaker's experience building cloud native communities around CNCF, Cilium, and eBPF, this talk is a practical introduction on how to create a place that people want to be.</p>
<p>Marketing is a one to many megaphone while community is constructed through a network of one to one relationships. We will break down the steps to develop these relationships from seeding the initial champions to leveraging existing communities to successfully growing beyond the reach of any one single person. The audience will walk away understanding how these one to one relationships and friendships are key to a successful community and how they can create one around their open source project, product, and company too.</p>"
How to chart your own career path in open source.,fosdem-2024-1880-how-to-chart-your-own-career-path-in-open-source-,"<p>There isn’t one way to build your career in open source as there are a variety of roles beyond writing code and many different routes into those roles. It’s also important for individuals to chart their own path that aligns with their unique experience and interest. </p>
<p>In this panel discussion, panelists will share how they got started in their career and their journey over the past two decades. For people looking for jobs in open source, we’ll discuss what we look for in candidates and why it’s not necessary to check all the boxes in job descriptions. We’ll also discuss challenges in balancing your day jobs vs. open source activities during your career. </p>
<p>In addition, we’ll also delve into other challenges and opportunities of an open source career that range from dealing with the impostor syndrome, DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) challenges, exploring open source communities for self growth, and more. </p>
<p>The goal of this session is to help attendees feel more comfortable exploring opportunities in open source and be confident in charting their own path. Our panel members will share what contributed to their success and the lessons learned throughout their extensive experience in open source. This session is meant to be interactive, and we’ll encourage attendees to ask questions and engage in the conversation.</p>"
Building Communities with Science!,fosdem-2024-2599-building-communities-with-science-,"<p>Many who work in community management and development can see the process as a bit of an art form. Working with communities requires lots of soft skills of communicating with many different types of stakeholders, making decisions that represent lots of people, and managing relationships. On top of all of this, systematically growing a community can be difficult. In this talk, I will discuss how Open@RIT has utilized evidence based methodologies to work with open source projects to not only better facilitate maintenance of open source projects, but also to systematically determine what resources (both human and technical) are needed in order to grow and maintain open source communities. You can expect to hear about methods for funding and executing this type of work, attitudes and initiatives that we have found most helpful, and stories from our own experience to help you guide yours.</p>"

Beyond the minimum effort to provide basic SecureBoot compatibility most distributions haven't (yet) delivered tangible benefits to users. In this talk I'd like to give an overview on how distributions can reasonably jump on the system integrity train, that makes the boot process and OS somewhat proof to offline attacks, and allows them to catch up with similar functionality that other commercial OSes have already been providing for a while.</p>
<p>This talk will be from a systemd perspective, and focus on the various OS integrity components we now provide, and how to put them together, with a focus on keeping things nicely generic, democatric, and modular without compromising security.</p>
<p>Specifically, we'll touch immutable initrds, UKIs, full disk encryption policies, TPM, and Measured Boot vs. Secure Boot, and more,</p>

Enhancing Linux Accessibility: A Unified Approach,fosdem-2024-2949-enhancing-linux-accessibility-a-unified-approach,"<p>Join us for a discussion aimed at supporting Linux distribution developers in enhancing accessibility. As blind software engineers, we believe we can bring a unique perspective to this essential endeavor.
We'll explore the challenges faced by blind users when using the Linux desktop environment, with a focus on constructive solutions. We will discuss two main topics: lack of preinstalled assistive technologies and accessibility problems of basic components of desktop environments. Our goal is to offer guidance and encouragement to developers, empowering them to create more inclusive experiences for all users.
In our vision for the ideal accessibility scenario, Linux distributions seamlessly accommodate the needs of blind users. To achieve this, we'll stress the importance of collaboration among developers and upstream projects, ensuring that accessibility becomes a fundamental consideration in the development process.
Additionally, we'll introduce the ""Linux Accessibility Guide"", a valuable resource that can assist developers in making graphical applications more accessible. This guide will offer practical insights and best practices to support their efforts.
Join us as we embark on a journey to improve the accessibility of Linux distributions, fostering an environment where accessibility is a shared goal, benefiting blind users and the entire Linux community. Together, we can create a more accessible and inclusive Linux desktop experience.</p>"
The State of Enterprise Linux 2023,fosdem-2024-2995-the-state-of-enterprise-linux-2023,"<p>There's been quite a bit of excitement around Enterprise Linux over the last few years, and that's made some people quite nervous, and others downright angry. This has left many confused about the state of Enterprise Linux. In open source, transparency, and sharing of ideas is critical. But it's more than just what you share, it's how you share it. This talk will delve into the state of Enterprise Linux from Red Hat's perspective and share it in a community driven way.</p>
<p>The upstream and downstream relationships that make up the RHEL supply chain contribute to what is arguably the largest and most sophisticated open source supply chain in the world. This large, sophisticated supply chain, and all of the Independent Software Developers (ISVs) involved, give RHEL a lot of gravity, probably more than any other open source product.</p>
<p>For years, I think many of us in the open source world assumed that we knew everything there was to know about open source, but the truth is, we’re all still learning. In the last couple of years, there have been some big changes in the Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) supply chain, often referred to as Enterprise Linux or EL for short. This talk will try to share a representative opinion from Red Hat about where we see Enterprise Linux today, where we think it's going, and where we'd like to take it.</p>"

The presentation will focus on obtaining and modifying source code, building packages and checking their binary compatibility, maintaining security advisories, building all images possible, as we do for AlmaLinux OS.</p>"
mkosi-initrd: Building initrds out of distribution packages,fosdem-2024-2888-mkosi-initrd-building-initrds-out-of-distribution-packages,"<p>Generally, initrd images have always been constructed by picking various files from the host filesystem, with various bespoke mechanisms to figure out all the dependencies that have to accompany said files. Instead, we propose to build initrd images out of distribution packages. This results in initrds that behave more like a regular Linux system, making them more reliable. </p>
<p>In this talk, we'll present mkosi-initrd, a project to build initrds out of distribution packages using mkosi (https://github.com/systemd/mkosi), systemd's image builder sister project. While it started as a <a href=""https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/mkosi-initrd"">Fedora project</a> , mkosi-initrd has recently gained support for Ubuntu, Debian, OpenSUSE, CentOS, RHEL, Alma Linux, Rocky Linux and Arch Linux. We'll discuss the new distribution-independent implementation, what's implemented and what's still missing. We'll also give a brief introduction on <a href=""https://github.com/systemd/mkosi"">mkosi</a> itself. </p>
<p>We're hoping to start a discussion on what it would take for popular distributions to consider adopting this approach to building initrds and to leave FOSDEM with new ideas on how to improve the project.</p>"

And what are the advantages and drawbacks for the various contributor roles? The talk answers these and other burning questions and reveals the hidden weaknesses of both setups.</p>"
"Desktop Linux, as easy as a smartphone! Just in a Snap!",fosdem-2024-1860-desktop-linux-as-easy-as-a-smartphone-just-in-a-snap-,"<p>Have you already thought about how the applications we develop get distributed to end users?</p>
<p>Often developers only provide the source code. So for not so tech-savvy users the major distributions need to pick up projects and package it, and maintain it for new releases.</p>
<p>This is why there is a need for distribution-independent, secure, and easy-to-use packaging, like on smartphones. This exists also for Linux ... Among the options, there is <a href=""https://snapcraft.io/about""><strong>Snap</strong></a>! Applications are easy to find in the Snap Store and they are installable on most Linux distributions.</p>
<p>And, to make Linux even easier for end users, we cannot only provide applications in the Snap format, but also have an <strong>all-Snap operating system, <a href=""https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/ubuntu-core-desktop-deep-dive/"">Ubuntu Core Desktop</a></strong>, an <a href=""https://ubuntu.com/blog/ubuntu-core-an-immutable-linux-desktop"">immutable core operating system</a> based on Snap. And here we do not only have Snaps of desktop applications, but also system applications and components (like the printing stack), the kernel, the desktop environment (like GNOME or KDE), the boot loader, and the core system. So everything can get easily updated or replaced by alternatives, and in case of failure one can easily revert (on boot failure we revert automatically).</p>
<p>All this is based on the knowledge and experience we gained at Canonical when creating the smartphone operating system <a href=""https://ubports.com/"">Ubuntu Touch</a>. After the phone project having been discontinued we started with the IoT system Ubuntu Core, snapped desktop applications, ...</p>

Supporting architecture psABIs with GNU Guix,fosdem-2024-2927-supporting-architecture-psabis-with-gnu-guix,"<p>Starting with glibc-2.33, glibc grew the capability to search for shared libraries using additional paths, based on the hardware capabilities of the machine running the code.  This was great for x86_64 (and also powerpc64le and s390x), which was first released in 2003 and has seen many changes in the capabilities of the hardware since then.  While it is extremely common for Linux distributions to compile for a baseline which encompasses all of an architecture, there was a lot of performance being left on the table by targeting such an old specification and not one of the newer revisions.</p>
<p>Some distributions have opted to increase the baseline to x86-64-v2 or even -v3, but even there you are potentially leaving performance on the table while removing some of the older machines from being able to run on your distribution.  By targeting all of the psABI targets you don't remove the option of using old hardware while still providing optimized libraries for newer hardware, and you have happier users getting more out of their hardware.</p>"

2023 in Chimera Linux,fosdem-2024-2524-2023-in-chimera-linux,"<p>Chimera Linux is a novel Linux distribution built around FreeBSD core tools and the LLVM toolchain. Since its initial launch in 2021, it has made a lot of progress and is now in alpha stage. The system can be deployed on a wide array of hardware and many people are using it as their desktop system; it works on x86_64, AArch64, POWER (little and big endian) as well as RISC-V and by now comes with thousands of packages.</p>
<p>While trying to be practical, Chimera is also highly hardened, partly thanks to the LLVM toolchain, rendering it immune to various security issues other distros are vulnerable to. It has transparent and robust infrastructure, ensuring smooth deployment of packages. We are also developing various new tooling that the whole ecosystem can benefit from, including the Turnstile session tracker. Service management is based around Dinit, a modern, supervising system; we maintain and create a variety of tooling around it, trying to break the existing status quo with systemd, while abandoning legacy approaches.</p>
<p>2023 has seen several major milestones, so I will focus on these, while also giving a short overview so that people unfamiliar with the system don't feel lost. I will also explain how our work benefits the entire Linux ecosystem, as well as beyond.</p>"

OpenTelemetry already provides agents and SDKs that allows us to instrument our applications and generate distributed traces, however this talk focuses on approaches to generating distributed traces with eBPF by making zero code or configuration changes to the application stack.</p>
<p>We’ll discuss approaches on tracking server/client context in web services with eBPF and how we can propagate this context in some programming languages/frameworks. We’ll also focus on the challenges and approaches to implementing context tracking and propagation with eBPF to protocols other than HTTP.</p>"
What’s possible in observability when we have frame pointers,fosdem-2024-3513-what-s-possible-in-observability-when-we-have-frame-pointers,"<p>At Polar Signals we have worked with the maintainers of someone of the most used Linux distributions.</p>
<p>The recently announced enabling of frame pointers of [a Linux distribution] is going to be a leap forward for observability.</p>
<p>By enabling frame pointers by default, we're lowering the barrier to entry for performance profiling and debugging, meaning:</p>
<p>Simplified Profiling: Dive straight into profiling without worrying about compiler configurations.
Lower Overhead: Unwinding with frame pointers is significantly cheaper than using DWARF or DWARF-derived information.
Debugging Accessibility: Even those new to profiling can access high-quality data, democratising the process of performance optimisation. It will allow bcc-tools, bpftrace, perf and other such tooling to work out of the box.
Ecosystem Benefit: [distribution] comprises thousands of open source projects, and we'll work to upstream performance fixes that we find across potentially thousands of packages wherever we can.</p>
<p>In this talk we're going to do a deep dive in the above topic and will learn how administrators and users can benefit from the work starting today.</p>"

Covert Ground Based Synthetic Aperture RADAR using a WiFi emitter and SDR receiver,fosdem-2024-2050-covert-ground-based-synthetic-aperture-radar-using-a-wifi-emitter-and-sdr-receiver,"<p>Using a WiFi emitter as radiofrequency source illuminating a scene under investigation for slow movement (e.g. landslides), a Ground-Based Synthetic Aperture RADAR (GB-SAR) is assembled using commercial, off the shelf hardware. The dual-channel coherent Software Defined Radio (SDR) receiver records the non-cooperative emitter signal as well as the signal received by a surveillance antenna facing the scene. Spatial diversity for azimuth mapping using direction of arrival measurement is achieved by moving the transmitter and receiver setup on a rail along a meter-long path -- the longer the better the azimuth resolution -- with quarter wavelength steps. The fully embedded application runs on a Raspberry Pi 4 single board computer executing GNU Radio on a Buildroot-generated GNU/Linux operating system.

Searching the cosmic haystack with software radio: the breakthrough listen search for narrowband doppler drifting signals and combatting radio frequency interference,fosdem-2024-2574-searching-the-cosmic-haystack-with-software-radio-the-breakthrough-listen-search-for-narrowband-doppler-drifting-signals-and-combatting-radio-frequency-interference,"<p><code>turboseti</code> served as the workhorse software and algorithm used to search for extraterrestrial intelligence over the the past decade. The Breakthrough Listen project has an updated pipeline for narrowband doppler drifting signals that learns from the last decade of data collection from the Green Bank Telescope, The Allen Telescope Array, Very Large Array, and Meerkat.</p>
<p>This talk will give an overview of the new and improved narrowband doppler drifting search pipeline created for the Breakthrough Listen project which searches for signs of extraterrestrial intelligence using radio telescopes. The new pipeline called BLISS (Breakthrough Listen Interesting Signal Search) includes a new C++-based device-aware ndarray library called BLAND (Breakthrough Listen Arrays with N-Dimensions) heavily utilizing dlpack for easy interaction with a large ecosystem of neighboring scientific computing tools used in software radio such as numpy, cupy, matplotlib, pytorch, tensorflow. We will show how this library works with a quick overview of ""why ndarrays"" and build on top of that to work through the whole pipeline from 100m dish to detected signals.</p>
<p>The current pipelines process hundreds of MHz of instantaneous bandwidth which is channelized in to various data products including down to channels of single-digit Hz. These fine channels are then used to search for narrowband doppler drifting signals. This search is sorting through the galactic haystack for needles which don't originate from earth. We'll highlight how we mitigate radio frequency interference, algorithmically search for signals with both single dish &amp; arrays, what's new &amp; corrected in the updated pipeline from historic SETI pipelines, and ways to join the SETI open source community.</p>

How expensive is it? Cost modelling for code with ML,fosdem-2024-2914-how-expensive-is-it-cost-modelling-for-code-with-ml,"<p>Knowing the ""cost"" of a specific piece of code, either in terms of runtime or in terms size, is quite important in guiding optimization efforts. However, understanding the actual cost of a piece of code, especially its runtime cost, is quite nontrivial. Benchmarks can be hard to run reliably, might require specialized hardware or software environments, and can be quite noisy. While the machines that the code we wish to analyze runs on are fundamentally deterministic, the  lack of availability of low-level details from CPU/GPU manufacturers inhibits low-level performance analysis work. To this end, we present two pieces of work towards achieving production-ready ML-based cost modes. Firstly, GNNs to analyze the performance of small snippets of assembly, and secondly small LLMs to predict the final size of a functions as a stepping stone towards performance prediction. In addition, we outline other work in the area, such as dataset construction, to enable further experimentation on these problems within the community.</p>"
Introducing 'Refiners' – A Micro-Framework for Seamless Integration of Adapters in Neural Networks,fosdem-2024-1821-introducing-refiners-a-micro-framework-for-seamless-integration-of-adapters-in-neural-networks,"<p>In the evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, we're witnessing a significant shift in deep-learning design patterns, particularly with the advancement of foundational models. A key innovation in this area is the concept of 'adapters' –  small yet powerful add-ons that enhance an existing neural network with new capabilities without retraining its core layers.</p>
<p>However, this innovation brings a hefty software engineering challenge, mainly when we discuss creating an open-source library encompassing a diverse range of these adapters. Neural networks, by their nature, are built using frameworks that procedurally encode their operations. Every time a new adapter is introduced, it often requires a substantial rewrite or rethinking of the existing code base.</p>
<p>To address this challenge, we've developed 'Refiners' – a streamlined micro-framework built on top of PyTorch, one of the most popular machine learning frameworks. The goal of Refiners is to serve as a comprehensive collection of foundational models and their respective adapters. Its primary design pattern sets it apart: envisioning all neural networks as a 'Chain' of primary layers, neatly nested one after the other. Furthermore, we've integrated the 'Context API,' a feature that allows the implementation of complex models, including those that don't follow a simple linear structure.
By doing so, Refiners simplifies the integration of new adapters, making it easier for developers to build and enhance neural networks without the need to overhaul their entire code base each time. This approach saves time and opens up new possibilities for innovation in AI development.</p>"

But if a developer wants to consume AI in their applications, do they need to be an AI expert? The simple answer is No!</p>
<p>In this talk application developers will learn how they can treat AI the same as any other ""function"" where they give it input and it returns the expected output. This is made possible by open source AI frameworks that enable users to manage models through a set of developer friendly APIs. Discussion will revolve around open source frameworks like Ray, TGIS, Triton and TorchServe, to give an understanding of the tools available to help on the AI journey. There will be a demo of one of these runtimes in action by loading open source models from Hugging Face from different domains and querying the models through a web UI. </p>
<p>There are great open source tools out there that provide an abstraction layer for application developers where they can consume AI models through APIs independent of understanding the data form of the model. Walking away from this talk, programmers will have a good appreciation of how they can practically consume AI in their applications without being an AI master.</p>"
Using Haystack to Build Custom Functionality for LLM Applications,fosdem-2024-2424-using-haystack-to-build-custom-functionality-for-llm-applications,"<p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an incredibly powerful technique (a hack, if you will) to make use of powerful LLMs while making sure they produce accurate information based on your own data. However, model providers and open-source frameworks cannot know exactly what you need for every application you might need to build.</p>
<p>In this talk, we will look at Haystack, an open-source LLM framework, and see how you can use Haystack to build your own customized LLM functionality:
- What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation
- How to build custom RAG pipelines with a choice of model providers
- How to customize your own tooling for LLM applications
- Example: Build a 'HackerNewsFetcher' for a RAG application that uses the latest Hacker News articles.</p>"

"Fortify AI against regulation, litigation and lobotomies",fosdem-2024-2079-fortify-ai-against-regulation-litigation-and-lobotomies,"<p>AI models, particularly LLMs, readily and sometimes unwittingly may plagiarize content—what constitutes acceptable use is currently not fully resolved— opening their users to copyright tort and other forms of litigation. For society an immanent danger is also in how easily they can be poisoned or lobotomized to propagate disinformation. It is also difficult to uncover and address sources of bias. The later is of particular legislative concern—see emerging regulations such as the EU’s AI Act as a prototype for whats to come. Without traceability for data with clear license expressions and provenance, AI models are easy targets. The open source community are particularly vulnerable and defenseless. Without a preemptive strategy legal risks are untenable. We expect an avalanche of litigation in response to AI driven disruption of the business of established information providers and creatives.
The talk focuses on both the legal and moral issues at hand but also the means to address the issues through traceability and model governance.</p>"
A Principled Component Analysis of Open Source Artificial Intelligence,fosdem-2024-2909-a-principled-component-analysis-of-open-source-artificial-intelligence,"<p>Artificial intelligence is more accessible to developers, designers, and users than ever before.

Codes Bound by Ethics: The Rising Tide of Non-Free Software Licenses in AI ecosystems,fosdem-2024-2750-codes-bound-by-ethics-the-rising-tide-of-non-free-software-licenses-in-ai-ecosystems,"<p>Ethical AI has emerged as a pivotal global discourse, reflecting the growing realization of its profound impact on societies worldwide. While social issues give rise to policy solutions and thus legislations, ethics are deeply rooted in societal values that differ greatly from one jurisdiction to another. In the last decade, diverse groups and individuals have departed from using exclusively Free Software licenses on their projects to developing new types of licensing solutions which prioritize “ethical” restrictions on how software should be further used and distributed. In this talk, I will delve into the ethical dimensions of the convergence of AI and Free Software, examining the challenges and opportunities in building responsible and ethical AI solutions within the free software ecosystem.</p>
<p>This talk firstly provides examples of some of the most common licensing models imposing “ethical” restrictions. It then examines how licensing models imposing additional behavior restrictions that supposedly call themselves “open” are in contravention of the definitions of Free Software and Open Source Software. We will further explore some predominant material harms emanating from the use of these restrictive licenses. Lastly, given the various technical &amp; legal obstacles in using these restrictive licenses, I implore that the ethical compliance checks must fall within the purview of regulations and not software licenses.</p>
<p>Given the proliferation of ethical licenses in AI landscapes causing additional behavior restrictions, integration of Free Software, license compatibility and licensing compliance become more complex, affecting the whole ecosystem. This presentation seeks to increase awareness about this crucial issue, particularly as public funds are being allocated to AI projects that may, at times, employ restrictive licensing practices.</p>"
"Open Source AI at TechWorks, the UK trade body for Electronic Systems Engineering",fosdem-2024-2863-open-source-ai-at-techworks-the-uk-trade-body-for-electronic-systems-engineering,"<p>In this talk we discuss work by TechWorks, the trade body for electronic systems engineering in the UK, to create a collaborative, open guide to help electronic systems engineers expand their skillset to AI roles.</p>
<p>TechWorks is not specifically an open source organization. However for a number of years it has taken an open approach to many of its standardization practices.  For example all the guides from the IoT Security Foundation (part of TechWorks) are release under a Creative Commons license. We will give a brief overview of this organization at the start of the talk.</p>
<p>TechWorks identified that the shortage of AI engineers would represent a problem for the industry going forward.  However this is an industry with many, experienced software and hardware engineers.  The need therefore was for material to help those engineers transition to AI.</p>
<p>The result, now 18 months into its development, is an open guide to best practice in AI and Machine Learning for experienced professional engineers (https://technes-uk.github.io/best-practice-guide/).  The source is maintained on GitHub and written in Sphinx, using a Creative Commons Attribution license (https://github.com/TechNES-UK/best-practice-guide).  This allows easy community contributions using pull-requests.</p>
<p>We'll explore the challenges in developing this guide, and share plans for completing the initial release, and then maintaining it going forward.</p>"
How to Win 1st Place in the Kernel Patch Statistics - Tools and Workflows,fosdem-2024-3214-how-to-win-1st-place-in-the-kernel-patch-statistics-tools-and-workflows,"<p>Every three months, the kernel community produces a new kernel version by integrating more
than 400 pull requests coordinated between maintainers.
For ""simple"" changes to a single subsystem, ad-hoc submissions work fine.
But when changes affect a lot of subsystems, the submitter needs to take more of the matter in
their own hands.</p>
<p>Uwe has completed a few cleanup quests in the kernel involving hundreds of patches and there is no shortage of further ideas. In this talk he presents the tools and workflows for mainline contributions he uses to keep on top of things.
This covers everything from patch creation, selecting the right recipients, sending out series, to tracking patch application by the respective subsystem maintainers.
Tools mentioned include: <a href=""https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#_introduction"">git</a> (e.g. notes, filter-branch, rebase), <a href=""https://coccinelle.gitlabpages.inria.fr/website/"">coccinelle</a>, <a href=""https://notmuch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/man1/notmuch.html"">notmuch</a>, <a href=""https://b4.docs.kernel.org/en/latest/"">b4</a> and scripting around these.</p>"
Streamlining kernel hacking with mkosi-kernel,fosdem-2024-2209-streamlining-kernel-hacking-with-mkosi-kernel,"<p>mkosi (https://github.com/systemd/mkosi) is a general purpose image builder that can be used for all kinds of workflows, including kernel hacking! The mkosi-kernel project (https://github.com/DaanDeMeyer/mkosi-kernel) intends to make hacking on the kernel as streamlined and painfree as possible. This talk will give a brief introduction to mkosi and mkosi-kernel, explaining how it can be used as a day to day tool for building and testing patches to the Linux Kernel.</p>
<p>Unlike alternatives like virtme(-ng), instead of booting from the host rootfs, mkosi-kernel will always build a custom image and boot into that. This image can be of any distribution, with any number of packages required to test kernel changes. Additionally, this image can be booted in a virtual machine as a disk image, cpio, unified kernel image or using virtiofs. Furthermore, mkosi-kernel can build various associated userspace projects like xfstests and make these available in the booted virtual machine for easy access to integration tests. Of course mkosi-kernel will also build the kernel itself for you if requested, but a prebuilt kernel can also be provided.</p>"
"libvpoll: create synthetic events for poll, select and friends",fosdem-2024-3102-libvpoll-create-synthetic-events-for-poll-select-and-friends,"<p>Many programs use poll/select system calls to wait for events that are triggered by file descriptor I/O events.
For instance, to write a library able to behave like a network stack (e.g. lwip and picoTCP) or a device, it's possible to implement functions like my_socket, my_accept, my_open and my_ioctl, as drop-in replacement of the system call counterparts.
Additionally, it's possible to use dynamic library magic to rename/divert the system call requests to use their virtual implementation provided by the library.
Unfortunately this approach cannot be applied to poll/select system calls because Linux doesn't have a system call that permits to generate synthetic generic events for a file descriptor, so it is not possible for libraries to provide file descriptors suitable for select/poll system calls.</p>
<p><a href=""https://github.com/rd235/libvpoll-eventfd"">libvpoll</a> permits to define file descriptors whose I/O events can be generated at user level.
This permits to generate synthetic events for poll, select, ppoll, pselect, epoll, etc.
The libvpoll library can use two different supports: a module that provides a virtual device and a kernel patch extending the eventfd system call.
When neither are availables, a feature-limited emulation is provided as a fallback: based on pipe it manages only POLLIN and POLLOUT.
This approach allows mixing real file descriptors with others provided by libraries as parameters of poll/select system calls.
For example libvpoll has been used in <a href=""https://github.com/virtualsquare/picoxnet"">picoxnet</a>, a user-level network stack implemented as a library for the <a href=""https://wiki.virtualsquare.org/#/tutorials/ioth"">Internet of Threads</a>.
libvpoll, as well as the kernel device module, are already available in Debian.</p>"
More flexible user namespaces,fosdem-2024-2987-more-flexible-user-namespaces,"<p>The user namespace has been around for over a decade at this point yet it's adoption has been somewhat lagging.
This can be tracked down to a lot of complexity that comes with it, from having to decide what uid/gid maps to use for what container, punching holes through the map to pass host resources, handle mapping of the owner of various files on the filesystem, ...</p>
<p>In this talk, we'll be looking at the current state of the user namespace, its most common limitations and annoyances, and then go over a proposed design for a second generation of user namespaces. Those rely on recent kernel features to provide a massively simpler and more flexible experience which should unblock the use of user namespaces for many!</p>

Linux Kernel TPM security and Trusted Key updates,fosdem-2024-3141-linux-kernel-tpm-security-and-trusted-key-updates,"<p>The Linux Kernel TPM subsystem has been somewhat static for a while.  For TPM2 (the standard TPM nowadays) it is used for IMA (PCR extensions), Periodic random number seeding and Trusted Keys (effectively TPM sealed data which may be piped securely to userspace because it can only be unwrapped by the kernel).  The big upcoming change is adding encryption and HMAC security to all TPM transactions because of the threats from Interposers (hardware corrupted to snoop the TPM bus).  This will be completely transparent to users, but infrastructure can be added to detect interposer compromises.  This talk will outline how this works and the null seed scheme for detecting interposers.</p>
<p>TPM keys (really TPM sealed data) have been around for a long time and can be used for things like storing the symmetric key for LUKS based dm-crypt.  A recent innovation for the kernel was to adopt the standardised form for ASN.1 keys (so other tools can seal and unseal them) and the latest innovation will be to add TPM policy (including signed policies) to kernel keys.  This talk will detail what TPM policy is, how it works and how it can be used by the kernel.</p>"
Linux Matchmaking: Helping devices and drivers find each other,fosdem-2024-3222-linux-matchmaking-helping-devices-and-drivers-find-each-other,"<p>Devices identify themselves. Drivers probe matched devices for compatibility.</p>
<p>What appears straight forward on the outset, can be quite serpentine on the everyday System-on-Chip:
Devices may refuse to self-identify, require interaction to be addressable, or have - possibly circular - dependencies on other devices. Failure to account for this leads to unchaperoned devices, probe deferrals, and if one is very unlucky, runtime issues up to a bricked system.</p>
<p>Ahmad has debugged a fair share of such issues, either during initial hardware bring-up, after kernel updates or when porting Linux drivers to the barebox bootloader.
In his talk, he will introduce the Linux driver model with a focus on tracking dependencies and discuss how to debug and address common issues with tools like ftrace, dev_err_probe and fw_devlink.</p>"
The case for a virtual Rust stateless codec driver,fosdem-2024-2985-the-case-for-a-virtual-rust-stateless-codec-driver,<p>This talk will present the case for a Rust stateless codec driver in V4L2. It will highlight the basics of stateless decoding in the media subsystem and walk the audience through the current status of the Rust bindings submitted by the author as it takes stock of the missing pieces to make a functional driver. It will then discuss how this project relates with the ongoing efforts to bring Rust to the rest of the multimedia stack on Linux.</p>
Puzzlefs - the Next-Generation Container Filesystem,fosdem-2024-1756-puzzlefs-the-next-generation-container-filesystem,"<p><a href=""https://github.com/project-machine/puzzlefs"">PuzzleFS</a> is a container filesystem designed to address the limitations of the existing OCI format. The main goals of the project are reduced duplication, reproducible image builds, direct mounting support and memory safety guarantees, some inspired by the <a href=""https://hackmd.io/@cyphar/ociv2-brainstorm"">OCIv2 proposal brainstorm</a>.</p>
<p>Reduced duplication is achieved using the content defined chunking algorithm FastCDC. This implementation allows chunks to be shared among layers. Building a new layer starting from an existing one allows reusing most of the chunks. The author will compare space usage of puzzlefs images to traditional OCI layouts in a real-world use case, showcasing the storage savings.</p>
<p>Another goal of the project is reproducible image builds, which is achieved by defining a canonical representation of the image format.</p>
<p>Direct mounting support is a key feature of puzzlefs and, together with fs-verity, it provides data integrity. Currently, PuzzleFS is implemented as a userspace filesystem (FUSE). A <a href=""https://rust-for-linux.com/puzzlefs-filesystem-driver"">read-only kernel filesystem driver</a> is under development.</p>
<p>Lastly, memory safety is critical to puzzlefs, leading to the decision to implement it in Rust. Another goal is to share the same code between user space and kernel space in order to provide one secure implementation.</p>"

Linux' receive_fd_replace() semantics confusing,fosdem-2024-3034-linux-receivefdreplace-semantics-confusing,"<p>The current implementation of seccomp's ADDFD uses the receive_fd_replace()
helper, and the semantics of this are quite confusing. It does what it says on
the tin: it replaces a file descriptor in the fd table of the trapped process.
However, various kernel subsystems (e.g. epoll) take a copy of the file
descriptor <em>number</em> for their internal data structures, in addition to a ref of
the struct file. This creates all sorts of problems: epoll will not report
events correctly since the new struct file * is not replaced in the epoll
instance, and may generate errors, etc.</p>
<p>We'll go over epoll's representation in detail along with our current
in-production solution to fix all of this up from userspace. We'll also go over
<a href=""https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20230318060248.848099-1-aloktiagi@gmail.com/"">1</a>, a proposed solution for fixing up epoll in particular, that would require
each instance of this to be manually fixed.</p>

kernel fixing would look like.</p>"
What is Linux kernel keystore and why you should use it in your next application,fosdem-2024-3371-what-is-linux-kernel-keystore-and-why-you-should-use-it-in-your-next-application,"<p>Did you know that Linux has a full-featured keystore ready to be used by any application or service it runs? Applications can securely store and share credentials, secrets and cryptographic keys, sign and encrypt data, negotiate a common encryption key - all this by never touching a single byte of the underlying cryptographic material.</p>
<p>This is especially useful in the post-heartbleed and cloud-native environments, where services authenticate and securely talk to each other using some kind of credentials. But if a network-facing service also has some secret in its process address space, it sets itself up for a security failure as any potential out-of-bounds memory access vulnerability may allow the secret to be leaked. Imagine a world where you don’t have to run an SSH agent just to protect your SSH keys.</p>
<p>On top of keeping your secrets secret Linux keystore nicely integrates with specialized security hardware, like TPMs and HSMs and may provide a single entry point on the system for applications to obtain their secrets. Thus Linux keystore is a very useful building block for a corporate key management system.</p>"
A few limitations in the available fs-related system calls,fosdem-2024-2149-a-few-limitations-in-the-available-fs-related-system-calls,"<p>Out of curiosity a few months ago, I wrote a tool from scratch to get a backup of my home folder, and preserve as much as possible, including files/folders encrypted with fscrypt, inode creation and change times etc. It works but it's hackish, and the reason is that the currently available system call interface has a few limitations that prevent a cleaner/safer approach. In this presentation I'll try to point out those limitations, present some use cases specific to backup, and hopefully get some feedback on how to proceed.</p>"

You ran tcpdump, but your packets do reach the interface and the command isn't helpful? You have a tracing tool, but you don't know where to look for in the Linux networking stack? You have hunch where to look at, but can't filter efficiently to find your packet? Look no further, pwru is the tool that you need!</p>
<p>Relying on the BTF information for the kernel, <a href=""https://github.com/cilium/pwru/"">pwru</a> can attach eBPF probes to all functions in the networking stack that take a socket buffer (skb) in their arguments, and provides a quick view of the packet's trajectory.

Isolation Levels and MVCC in SQL Databases: A Technical Comparative Study,fosdem-2024-3600-isolation-levels-and-mvcc-in-sql-databases-a-technical-comparative-study,"<p>As a developer, it is crucial to understand Isolation Levels and Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) to create scalable applications without compromising data integrity due to race conditions. Although the default isolation level in most databases is usually adequate, it is important to know and use it correctly in your application. This technical session explores the implementation of these concepts in popular SQL databases such as Oracle, MySQL, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, and YugabyteDB. We will also examine why traditional SQL standard definitions may not be suitable for MVCC databases and why this knowledge is essential for developers. By the end of the session, you will be able to navigate these subtleties with ease and make informed decisions in your application design without getting too academic.</p>"

As the popularity and adoption of PostgreSQL continues to grow, the interaction of roles, privileges, and object ownership is a recurring theme of confusion in forums and mailing lists.</p>
<p>In this session, I’ll start by defining the Principle of Least Privileges and how this philosophy influences roles and privileges in PostgreSQL. Next, I’ll demonstrate the importance of object ownership in PostgreSQL, how group and user roles can work in unison to effectively manage permissions, multiple ways to manage default privileges, and which privileges should always be modified in any new PostgreSQL database. Finally, I’ll discuss how recent releases are laying a foundation for more flexible and robust security management in the years ahead.</p>
<p>By the end of this session, you will understand how roles work in PostgreSQL, how they impact your daily work, and how to effectively communicate security best practices with others on your team.

How to Use Private Data in Generative AI: End-to-End Solution for Retrieval Augmented Generation with CrateDB and LangChain,fosdem-2024-2112-how-to-use-private-data-in-generative-ai-end-to-end-solution-for-retrieval-augmented-generation-with-cratedb-and-langchain,"<p>This talk focuses on the synergistic combination of CrateDB (https://github.com/crate/crate) and LangChain (https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain): it helps to get started with using private data as context for large language models through LangChain, incorporating the concept of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). CrateDB as an open-source distributed SQL database helps to streamline data management by supporting a wide variety of data models ranging from documents over time series and full-text search towards recently added support for vectors and similarity search. Thus, it helps to avoid technology sprawl in modern data architectures that need to cope with structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data while not sacrificing the convenience of having a standard SQL interface. LangChain, an open-source framework written in Python, is specifically designed to facilitate the development of applications using large language models (LLMs). LangChain enables seamless integration of language models with various data sources and services, acting as a bridge between AI language capabilities and private data.</p>
<p>During the talk we will demonstrate CrateDB's proficiency in storing and handling vector data, and how this can be utilized by large language models (LLMs) through LangChain, further enhanced by RAG for richer contextual insights. Through live coding demonstration, we will illustrate firsthand the process of extracting data from CrateDB and integrating it into LLMs using LangChain, thereby enriching language models with new data. This integration finds practical applications in semantic search, content recommendation, and data analytics, just to name a few.</p>
<p>The talk will appeal to anyone keen on leveraging Large Language Models, enhanced by Retrieval Augmented Generation, to unlock new insights from their private data. Participants will also learn how to leverage the CrateDB database to efficiently store vector data and utilize vector search in advanced analytics applications.</p>"
A murder party with Lea,fosdem-2024-2072-a-murder-party-with-lea,"<p><a href=""https://bitbucket.org/piedenis/lea/src/dev_lea3"">Lea</a> is a Python module helping to calculate probabilities on situations presenting uncertainties. It is meant to be open, intuitive, and easy.</p>
<p>Lea can deal with discrete variables, interdependent events, conditional probabilities, probabilistic programming  (PP) and many more. Unlike most of other probability toolkits, it is open to different probability representations, including fractions and symbols (using the <a href=""https://www.sympy.org"">SymPy library</a>). These features make Lea ideal for education, to learn the theory of probability, from basics to advanced concepts.</p>
<p>The talk will present classical or non-classical problems in probability, and how these can be solved easily using Python and Lea. These include games (dice roll, RPG combats, etc.) and funny paradoxes (non-transitive dice, boy or girl paradox, etc.). The “murder party” case will demonstrate how uncertain information can help to find out the most probable perpetrator of a murder. These examples will switch between probabilities as float numbers, fractions and symbols, i.e. returning formulas instead of numbers—and demonstrating practically Python’s “duck typing” at work.</p>

With all the new rage of LLMS and AI, it's more important than ever to make sure that you can wrap your head around all the old, new and upcoming data processing tools and services you use, but also track the provenance, lineage of the data, and make it easy to author and mange those for distributed teams.</p>
<p>This talk will bring to the light how modern Airflow 2.7+ provides proven and also modernised,  easy nd nice to use ways on how to do it.
Quite often you hear about the ""new"" orchestrator that aims to solve your orchestration needs. You can also often hear how it compares to Airlfow. However those comparisions often overlook the fact that since Airflow 2.0 has been introduced, it continues to evolve and piece-by-piece modernize itself and respond to the needs of processing even more data, and interacting with even more systems that were not even existing a year ago (think LLMs) - while continue harnessing the powers of other tools you already used in the past and bind them all together. </p>
<p>New UI, New ways of writing your orchestration tasks, new ways to test them, tracking lineage, simpler authoring and intracting with object storages. And the comparision often overlook that if you start your journey with Airflow today, your experience will be quite a bit different than even 2 years ago (what usually most comparisions talk about). This talk will highlight some of the important ones.</p>
<p>Also you might be surprised but this is all happening without breaking compatibility - hence you can still you use it in the ""old way"". But maybe it's time to learn new ways?</p>"
Data workflows: translating dbt to Apache Airflow,fosdem-2024-1651-data-workflows-translating-dbt-to-apache-airflow,"<p>This talk will discuss why and how to use dbt Core and Apache Airflow, open-source tools that support the development of data pipelines.</p>

A slow migration from Django templates to Vue+GraphQL,fosdem-2024-2326-a-slow-migration-from-django-templates-to-vue-graphql,"<p>The AlekSIS® project, a free and open school information system helping with digitisation of school organisation, originally had a frontend based on the server rendered Django template engine as a reliable and easy solution. As our frontends got more complex and we had to built interactive components like a timetable builder, we ran into limits of this system. In addition to that, the UI framework we had been using got out of support. So we decided to develop a completely new frontend as a single page application based on Vue.js and the UI framework Vuetify, connecting to the Django backend using a GraphQL API.</p>
<p>But because of our large, modular ecosystem with many different apps, we knew we never would be able to migrate everything to the new frontend within one release. Therefore, the team faced the challenge to integrate pages with the old frontend together with new pages in the new single page application. The core of this system is an abstraction layer that allows daisy chaining the Vuetify views with server-rendered pages, including sugar that lets legacy Django pages communicate with the client-side UI framework.</p>
<p>We would like to share our experiences about this complex migration and what problems to expect and how we solved them.</p>

How can we trust 3rd party code? Using Python to understand the trust relationships within the python ecosystem,fosdem-2024-2443-how-can-we-trust-3rd-party-code-using-python-to-understand-the-trust-relationships-within-the-python-ecosystem,"<p>As developers, we use open source libraries all the time to perform critical functions in our code, often searching for libraries in Google and installing from package registries like PyPI and npm. Because of this, open source packages are particularly vulnerable to malware attacks.</p>
<p>In this session we look at the web of trust we assume when we install a third party PyPI package. We explore some of the relationships between the people, repositories and code and how we can start to verify them. We try to define some of the ways a piece of code can be trustworthy or not - it isn’t just malice; old, abandoned, under-maintained code can be just as problematic.</p>
<p>We will look at some of the things we can measure, like the activity in the repo and the users and also the strength of the link between repo and source. We’ll also look at the scale of the problem and reasons we might want to automate it.</p>"

<p>In this talk, we will first present the concepts behind <code>Annotated</code>, introduced in the standard library with Python 3.9, perhaps as the first type hint to cross the runtime frontier. We'll then explore how this pattern has been increasingly embraced by third-parties libraries, many of which in the topic of data modelling and validation (such as the famous Pydantic), to provide nicer APIs to developers with improved <em>composability</em>, reduced boilerplate and better extensibility. Finally, we'll illustrate how to apply this pattern in a few take-away use cases in order to hopefully demystify <code>Annotated</code> to casual Python programmers as well as extend the horizon of more seasoned hackers, already familiar with meta-programming patterns.</p>"

squash the flakes! - how to minimize the impact of flaky tests,fosdem-2024-1805-squash-the-flakes-how-to-minimize-the-impact-of-flaky-tests,"<p>Flakes aka tests that don’t behave deterministically, i.e. they fail sometimes and pass sometimes, are an ever recurring problem in software development. This is especially the sad reality when running e2e tests where a lot of components are involved. There are various reasons why a test can be flaky, however the impact can be as fatal as CI being loaded beyond capacity causing overly long feedback cycles or even users losing trust in CI itself.</p>
<p>For the <a href=""https://kubevirt.io/"">KubeVirt</a> project we want to remove flakes as fast as possible to minimize the number of retests required. This leads to shorter time to merge, reduces CI user frustration, improves trust in CI, while at the same time it decreases the overall load for the CI system.</p>
<p>We start by generating a report of tests that have failed at least once inside a merged PR, meaning that in the end all tests have succeeded, thus flaky tests have been run inside CI. We then look at the report to separate flakes from real issues and forward the flakes to dev teams.</p>
<p>As a result retest numbers have gone down significantly over the last year.</p>
<p>After attending the session the user will have an idea of what our flake process is, how we exercise it and what the actual outcomes are.</p>"

Progressive Delivery Made Easy with Argo Rollouts,fosdem-2024-2502-progressive-delivery-made-easy-with-argo-rollouts,"<p>Progressive Delivery makes it easier to adopt Continuous Delivery, by deploying new versions to a subset of users and evaluating their correctness and performance before rolling them to the totality of the users, and rolled back if not matching some key metrics. Feature flags and Canary deployments are some of the techniques in Progressive Delivery, used to roll out new versions gradually.</p>
<p>For containerized workloads running on <a href=""https://kubernetes.io/"">Kubernetes</a> it is very easy to adopt Progressive Delivery using <a href=""https://argo-rollouts.readthedocs.io/"">Argo Rollouts</a>. At Adobe Experience Manager we are deploying over 10k non Adobe customer services to Kubernetes. New deployments can occur multiple times per day from internal changes or from customer code, which can be very different from one customer to another. A new feature or piece of code can work fine for 99% of customers but still affect the other 1%, and being able to detect this from just tests is a very costly process. </p>
<p>We will show how to implement a Progressive Delivery pipeline with Argo Rollouts to improve the reliability of the service and prevent regressions. It allows the protection of the service and automation of roll backs to a previous version if needed. This allows for faster delivery with more confidence so regressions are less likely to affect a customer.</p>"
Own your CI with Nix,fosdem-2024-2282-own-your-ci-with-nix,"<p>Having a good CI is a must-have for any serious software project nowadays.</p>
<p>Modern CI platforms and tools make it trivial to build an initial CI configuration and have it plugged in the development workflow.
They however don't solve the ongoing maintenance cost, as any CI system requires maintaining a specific logic for creating a suitable build environment on the CI runners, meaning that every change to the build requirements will have to be duplicated in the CI setup. And that duplication means that the different setups will inevitably drift out of sync, leading to head-banging errors that will only happen in one setup but not another.</p>
<p>This talk is about leveraging Nix to be able to declare an environment that can be used both locally, and on any CI service, so that the maintenance cost becomes minimal, and the environments are guaranteed to stay in sync.</p>"

Testing command-line programs feels awkward in Go. You can test the program's functions, of course, but what about making sure the whole thing works, with command line arguments, flags, and options?
We can build the program and run shell scripts, but that process is cumbersome, not integrated, and easy to let errors slip by.
Enters <code>go-internal/testscript</code>, a testing library that was designed to test the go tool itself. With it, we can test our command-line applications without leaving the 'go test' framework.
The <code>testscript</code> environment already offers built-in commands and conditions to test our application in many ways. For the advanced user, moreover, there is the possibility of creating custom commands and checks that make the test fit our development needs properly.
Attendees of this talk will learn:
* how to start with <code>testscript</code>, by testing any command-line application, whether it is produced by your project or not;
* how to integrate <code>testscript</code> into your project, and test the resulting binary within the test environment, without any additional steps;

Are Project Tests Enough for Automated Dependency Updates? A Case Study of 262 Java Projects on Github,fosdem-2024-3029-are-project-tests-enough-for-automated-dependency-updates-a-case-study-of-262-java-projects-on-github,"<p>Updating a new version of a third-party library is traditionally not a trivial task. Github's Dependabot, Renovate, and similar services automatically create a new branch with the latest version of a library dependency and then execute project tests to detect any breaking changes. While such services are gaining a lot of traction, no study looks into whether test suites of average GitHub Projects have sufficient coverage and are adequate to detect incompatible library changes.</p>
<p>To better understand the state of test coverage and effectiveness of project test suites for detecting incompatible library changes in open-source projects, I will, in this talk, present a study comprising 262 Java projects on GitHub. By artificially injecting faulty changes in library dependencies, we identify that test suites, on average, have coverage of 58% of their direct and 20% of their transitive dependencies. The average test suite effectively detects 47% of faulty updates in direct dependencies and 35% in transitive dependencies. Based on our findings, I will explain recommendations for developers and toolmakers that could improve the reliability and expectations of automated dependency updating.</p>"
