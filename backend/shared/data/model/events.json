I would like to present a new approach where we expose callee-saved register\nconstraints early in the backend pipeline. This creates more opportunities for the optimizers\nand gives good performance gains. Interestingly, we achieve per-register shrink-wrapping for\nfree. However, this makes emission of CFI directives much more complicated.\nI am currently in the process of upstreaming this work. The proof-of-concept branch is publicly\navailable here: https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/90819 I have only tried this approach\non RISCV, but it could be applied to other targets as well.</p>",

While traditional bitwise implementations are slow and less efficient, alternative methods such as lookup tables, carry-less multiplication, and hardware CRC instructions offer significant performance improvements. In this talk, I will present a novel method for automatically identifying and replacing inefficient bitwise CRC implementations with optimized alternatives. The approach uses fast detection of candidate code fragments, symbolic execution for validation, and automatic replacement with more efficient implementations.  The method is implemented in the GCC compiler as a separate pass and is open-source available. Experimental evaluation was performed for i386, AArch64, and RISC-V architectures, and the results demonstrated up to 91%, 98%, and 93% performance improvements respectively, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed optimization.</p>",

The movement of data through different storage classes can be achieved using S3 lifecycle rules based on the age of the files. Intelligent tiering for RGW (Rados Gateway) is a feature in Ceph storage that automatically moves data between storage tiers based on policies. This feature optimises storage costs and performance by moving frequently accessed data to faster storage tiers and less frequently accessed data to lower-cost, higher-capacity tiers. The intelligent tiering policy is customizable, allowing users to define criteria for data migration, such as access frequency, time, and size. This feature is particularly useful for large-scale object storage deployments, where optimizing storage costs and performance is crucial. The first step is to extend the existing cloud transition to include features like read-through, restore API(like glacier in s3 protocol)</p>",

The service ingests this exponentially growing amount of data at LHC data acquisition rates though its EOS based flash buffer and feeds up to 180 tape drives that write date on mounted tapes at over 90% write efficiency.</p>\n<p>This high efficiency archival service runs on open-source software and is deployed on-premise on commodity hardware.</p>\n<p>In this talk I would like to give you a high level view of the global CERN tape service performances and dive in the details of its real life deployment: from the flash buffer design principles to the tape servers connected to multiple tape drives via a dedicated network topology.</p>\n<p>All of the presented software are open source and available for use and are deployed in other laboratories around the world.</p>",

It is a complete and independent software defined storage solution, handling internally all aspects related to capacity management, performance, fault-tolerance, as well as interfacing with both Kubernetes and the end user. Longhorn is an actively-developed and mature software, however our installations have revealed that it currently lacks the ability to take advantage of the hardware performance available in local servers that feature high-speed solid state disks and high-bandwidth network connectivity. This presentation investigates a series of performance optimizations that have been engineered in the Longhorn's core that collectively allow the system to achieve an order of magnitude better IOPS and bandwidth.</p>",

This \"Single Sign-On\" approach allows for the use of a unified identity verification source across the entire information system, and is now being extended to VoIP.\nIn this conference, we will explore how OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect are integrated into a modern SIP environment, with a focus on managing and validating access tokens. To illustrate this, we will use our Flexisip server solution.</p>\n<p>Key Topics:\n- OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect: Introduction and benefits for authentication in modern SIP systems.\n- JWT for Authentication: Token signature validation and extracting user identity.\n- Integration in Flexisip: Demonstration of OAuth-based authentication with Flexisip, and token validation in a SIP environment.\n- Authorization Management: Controlling requests based on identity information extracted from access tokens.</p>\n<p>This conference will provide an overview of how to implement and secure user authentication with OAuth 2.0 and JWT in a SIP server, using Flexisip as a concrete example.</p>",

This led me to studying not only QUIC itself, but also RTP Over QUIC (RoQ) and Media Over QUIC (MoQT).</p>\n<p>As part of my learning process, I started writing a QUIC library, called imquic. While it can (mostly) be used as a generic QUIC/WebTransport library, I also implemented native support within the library for both RoQ and MoQT, as a testbed to use for prototyping the new protocols in an experimental way. This presentation will introduce these new protocols and the imquic library implementing them, talking a bit about the existing demos and the proof-of-concept integration in the Janus WebRTC Server for QUIC-to-WebRTC translation.</p>",

In addition, the terse nature of the language facilitates on-the-fly writing of very powerful short programs (so-called \"one-liners\") specifically tailored at the user's immediate tracing purposes.</p>\n<p>Where bpftrace has struggled in the past, is writing complex tools which are intended to run and be maintained for a prolonged period of time.

    "abstract": "<p>Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions continuously monitor the events occurring on an endpoint, create detailed process timelines, and analyse these data, to reveal suspicious patterns that could indicate threats such as ransomware. To create these detailed timelines, EDR solutions collect a variety of information about each process running on the endpoint, such as timestamp, PID, process name, path, command line, etc. On Linux systems, this is often done using the proc filesystem provided by the operating system, which provides rich information for each process currently running on the system.\nHowever, if a process is short-lived and exits quickly, the proc filesystem entries for it get cleared out before the EDR solution can read them, leading to incomplete timelines. To take a simple example, suppose a malicious actor runs a script that downloads a binary from the network and then executes it. This downloaded binary quickly spawns a bunch of long-running malicious processes and exits itself. If EDR solution is unable to extract the complete process information about the execution of the downloaded binary from proc filesystem (being a short-lived process), it'll miss details about the creator of the malicious process in the system. Hence, EDR solution will have visibility gaps about the downloaded binary required for Security Threat Analysis. \nWe propose a solution to address the gaps by attaching extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) programs dynamically to the Linux kernel system calls (such as fork, exec and exit) and extracting all the required information directly from the kernel hooks using BPF Type Format (BTF). These hooks use fundamental task structure in kernel representing a process or thread to extract variety of information about the process. Our proof of concept shows that eBPF-based process data extraction provides process timelines with near 100% reliability, compared to proc filesystem-based approaches which have a reliability of only around 83% for short lived processes.</p>",

This means that programs which should be rejected are accepted by the verifier, allowing unprivileged users to run malicious programs (e.g [<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-37709-9_12\">1</a>,<a href=\"https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity24/presentation/jin-di\">2</a>,<a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3627703.3629562\">3</a>,<a href=\"https://www.usenix.org/conference/osdi24/presentation/sun-hao\">4</a>,<a href=\"https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity24/presentation/lu-hongyi\">5</a>]). In this talk, we propose to evaluate the performance of the eBPF verifier through the measurement of three main aspects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Performance evaluation: to understand the evolution of the eBPF verifier versions, we evaluated the verification time and consumed memory of six eBPF verifier versions (Linux kernel 5.0 to 6.8, both included). The results show that for some eBPF programs, the verifiers have nearly the same verification times (except for the conditional jumps, where the verification time has decreased since the introduction of the bounded loops in the Linux kernel 5.3). Consumed memory remains also stable.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Comparative evaluation with <a href=\"https://vbpf.github.io/\">PREVAIL</a>: as the eBPF verifier is not sound, we compared it to PREVAIL, which is another verifier proposed in 2019 at the PLDI conference. PREVAIL is a sound verifier that runs in user space and is used in the eBPF infrastructure of Windows. On the one hand, we were interested in the implementation differences between the two verification solutions and on the other hand, we observed the performance difference between the two verifiers. We observed that, although PREVAIL's performance has improved, it remains less efficient than the eBPF verifier. Nevertheless, PREVAIL showed that it can efficiently verify programs containing a lot of paths (implied by conditional jumps) thanks to the join operator and the fixpoint computation used for the bounded loops, where the eBPF verifier would have created a lot of paths, trying to reduce them with pruning.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Impact of compilers: beyond the verification mechanisms, there are external constraints such as the compilers: An eBPF program is first compiled into eBPF bytecode and then analyzed. However, we observed that for the eBPF verifier with a specific eBPF program, which varies only by its number of loop iterations, Clang-8 produced more programs accepted by the eBPF verifier and these programs are verified faster than those produced by Clang-14.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

    "abstract": "<p>The eBPF verifier has repeatedly suffered from bugs in its verification\nalgorithm which enable malicious applications to perform container escapes and\nprivilege escalation. To improve upon this, existing work applies fuzzing (<a href=\"https://lpc.events/event/18/contributions/1933/\">Chaignon'24</a>)\nand formal methods (<a href=\"https://lpc.events/event/18/contributions/1937/\">Agni</a>) to the verifier in order to find and fix bugs. However,\nin the mid-term, these approaches are unlikely to result in a verifier that is\nfully bug-free. While academic works have proposed the use of hardware-based\nisolation (<a href=\"https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity24/presentation/lu-hongyi\">MOAT</a>, <a href=\"https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity24/presentation/zhang-peihua\">Hive</a>, <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3689938.3694781\">SafeBPF</a>) and software-fault isolation (<a href=\"https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity24/presentation/jin-di\">BeeBox</a>) to mitigate verifier bugs,\nthese approaches suffer from portability issues, require significant\ndesign-changes with unclear consequences, or have runtime overheads.</p>\n<p>Motivated by the shortcomings of the existing approaches, this talk discusses an\nalternative approach to prevent verifier-bugs from being exploited. By requiring\neBPF bytecode to be compiled from <em>safe</em> Rust source code by a trusted systems\nservice, program-safety would effectively be checked twice by two very different\nstatic analyzers (i.e., rustc's compiler passes and the eBPF verifier). Therefore, a bug in one of\nthe analyzers will no longer directly result in a kernel exploit as the other\nanalyzer is unlikely to exhibit the same buggy behavior and therefore still\ncatch malicious programs. This approach is appealing as it is unlikely to result in runtime\noverheads and does not require significant changes to the kernel.</p>\n<p>We analyze whether this is a viable approach to mitigate bugs in the eBPF\nverifier, taking runtime-overheads, expressiveness, and security into\nconsideration. Specifically, we analyze whether past bugs in rustc and the eBPF\nverifier could have been chained together in order to exploit the proposed\ndesign as a whole. If we find that this is the case, we plan to analyze whether\nthere are any fundamental changes (e.g., disabling complex and bug-prone rustc\nfeatures) that would have prevented the exploit(s).</p>",

ManaTEE aims to address these challenges by integrating a set of Privacy Enhancing Techniques (PETs), including confidential computing, to safeguard data privacy without compromising usability. The framework provides an interactive interface through JupyterLab, ensuring an intuitive experience for researchers and data scientists. We will showcase how Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) ensure both data confidentiality and execution integrity, fostering trust between data owners and analysts. Furthermore, we will highlight how confidential computing can offer additional properties such as proof of execution, enabling researchers to demonstrate the reproducibility and integrity of their results through attestation.

This enhancement will also allows us to support UEFI variable store to support Secure Boot.</p>\n<p>Achieving this persistence requires storing encrypted state securely on the untrusted host, with early boot-time attestation to decrypt and validate the state. This process raises several technical challenges that we are actively tackling.</p>\n<p>Join us to explore the latest progress in Coconut SVSM, the challenges we’ve overcome, and the exciting opportunities still ahead.</p>",

One key feature is Remote Attestation (RA), which enables integrity verification of a TEE. However, <em>compatibility</em> issues with RA verification arise as no browsers natively support this feature, making prior solutions cumbersome and risky. </p>\n<p>To address these challenges, in this talk, we present RA-WEBs (<strong>R</strong>emote <strong>A</strong>ttestation for <strong>Web</strong> <strong>s</strong>ervices), a novel RA protocol designed for high compatibility with the current web ecosystem.

    "abstract": "<p>Securing embedded devices, particularly those with minimal resources, presents a unique and pressing challenge. Conventional approaches to Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) often require specialized hardware or substantial system resources, leaving low-end devices vulnerable to breaches. The need for a lightweight, efficient solution that bridges this gap is greater than ever in today’s interconnected world.  </p>\n<h2>Introducing Spock</h2>\n<p>Through the development of Spock, we have created a versatile and efficient Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) tailored for RISC-V embedded devices. By relying solely on Physical Memory Protection (PMP) for isolation and requiring only machine and user modes as specified in the RISC-V privileged instruction set, Spock delivers robust security without relying on any specialized hardware.  </p>\n<p>At the core of Spock’s architecture is the <strong>Security Manager (SM)</strong>, which plays a key role in managing enclave data and buffer permissions. The SM enables Spock to efficiently virtualize buffers and dynamically allocate PMP entries, providing a flexible and scalable approach to memory isolation. By leveraging this abstraction, Spock can create virtual enclaves that surpass hardware-imposed limitations, such as the number of PMP entries.  </p>\n<h2>Core Features and Capabilities</h2>\n<p>Spock’s minimalist API design delivers essential security functions, including secure execution and attestation. This design supports:  </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Virtualization of critical operations while maintaining a minimal Trusted Computing Base (TCB).  </li>\n<li>Integration into very low resource embedded devices. </li>\n<li>Both relocatable and fixed enclaves, offering flexibility for diverse use cases.  </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Why Spock Matters</h2>\n<p>Spock’s design represents a modern, efficient solution for secure computing in low-resource embedded devices. Its ability to combine robust security with minimal hardware requirements makes it uniquely suited for the demands of today’s connected world, ensuring that even the smallest devices can operate securely.</p>\n<p>Available at : https://github.com/jiphelsen/Spock</p>",

I’ll start off by talking about some of the design decisions that went into building the <a href=\"https://github.com/apple/swift-distributed-tracing\">swift-distributed-tracing</a> library, which I co-created as part of Google Summer of Code in 2020. The talk will not only compare it to other Swift observability libraries (<a href=\"https://github.com/apple/swift-log\">swift-log</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/apple/swift-metrics\">swift-metrics</a>), but also highlight some of the differences between Distributed Tracing in Swift compared to other ecosystems. My personal highlight is the fact that we eliminated the need for support libraries such as “OTel instrumentation for this specific web framework” by implementing swift-distributed-tracing to be used by libraries directly.\nDuring the next part, I’ll cover what it means to build a tracer implementation for swift-distributed-tracing with plenty of examples from my OpenTelemetry client <a href=\"https://github.com/slashmo/swift-otel\">swift-otel</a>. I’ll finish the talk with an end-to-end example of a server-side Swift application using the <a href=\"https://github.com/hummingbird-project/hummingbird\">Hummingbird</a> web framework, fully instrumented using Logging, Metrics, and Distributed Tracing, including context propagation and log correlation. This example exports logs, metrics, and spans via the OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) to both a standalone OTel Collector instance and other observability backends that support OTLP natively.</p>\n<p>Links:\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/apple/swift-distributed-tracing\">GitHub: apple/swift-distributed-tracing</a>\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/swift-otel/swift-otel\">GitHub: slashmo/swift-otel</a>\n- <a href=\"https://opentelemetry.io\">OpenTelemetry Website</a></p>",

One of the key challenges of self-hosting an email server is the outdated and complex nature of most available open-source mail server software.</p>\n<p>Stalwart Mail Server seeks to change this by providing a modern, open-source mail server built in Rust that prioritizes ease of use, security, and privacy. Designed to simplify self-hosting, Stalwart Mail Server enables individuals and businesses to reclaim their email autonomy with confidence.

It is a major improvement over self-monitoring your MTA service, because it creates - in contrast to self-monitoring - a <strong>world-wide view</strong> how others „see“ your platform. It allows e.g. to make areas in the network visible, where TLS fails, to investigate and ideally to fix the problem in order to keep communication secure.</p>\n<p>Previously the capability to create and send TLSRPT reports had been limited to a few major platforms running their own or a commercial MTA.

The Postfix MTA will be the first Open Source MTA to <a href=\"https://www.postfix.org/TLSRPT_README.html\">implement functionality</a> that permits to send TLSRPT-relevant DATA to a TLSRPT report service. The service will collect the DATA, create a report and pass it on to an MTA for delivery or submit it directly via HTTP.</p>\n<p>Postfix’ new feature is the result of a collaborative effort between Wietse Venema, the creator of Postfix, and my company sys4 as we want to foster TLSRPT (also because it hinders German providers to qualify to become BSI approved „Secure E-Mail Platforms“).</p>\n<p>We created an Open Source low-level C-library that can be used by any MTA - not only Postfix - and the service required to create TLSRPT reports. Both can be downloaded at <a href=\"https://github.com/sys4/tlsrpt/\">github</a>. And we hope many other Open Source projects will use the library and the service to implement TLSRPT reporting in their MTA.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>In recent years DMARC has become one of the cornerstones of email deliverability. A large part of email is now protected by the combined efforts of SPF, DKIM and DMARC checks. However, the secret weapons of DMARC which are hardly used are its reports. Along with respecting the policy set by an email sender, the recipient also actively acknowledges how many emails have been sent, from which IP addresses and why some of them have been delivered and others not. This reporting is done by providing a xml file inside a zip attached to an email, which makes it rather hard to digest for humans. Imagine what happens if you get such a report every day for every internet domain you, all of your colleagues and anybody spoofing you send emails to...</p>\n<p>Obviously this calls for a tool. Interestingly, even though DMARC is almost a decade old, no good FOSS tool was ever developed. This is why DMARCaroni was created: free and open source software (written in Haskell and Elm) to deliver all your DMARC monitoring needs. In this talk I will unveil this new tool which I wrote in the last 18 months, show off its features, and talk about the roadmap.</p>",

Well, you could build a wireless router that runs stock OpenWrt and lets you modify it as you like, and then get that router tested to confirm it meets all FCC requirements.  So we did just that.</p>\n<p>The OpenWrt One is a wireless router built from the ground up by developers of OpenWrt, an SFC member project, and SFC staff to ensure that users would have full control of all the software on their device, and have it fully supported by stock OpenWrt on Day 1.  It is shipped in full compliance with the GPL, which means you are able to modify and reinstall Linux (for example).  As part of the design and testing of the OpenWrt One, we had it tested by an FCC testing lab to see if it met all FCC's requirements despite running software that the user could freely modify.</p>\n<p>In this talk we'll explore the history of FCC's rules on this, and describe how the FCC tests went for the OpenWrt One.

Some topics we may address:\n- What, if anything, is the source code of a model? If the source code includes training data, what are the implications for LLMs and other large generative models? Can trained weights themselves be considered source code? \n- What does user freedom (and in particular, freedom to study and modify) mean in the context of AI models?  How, if at all, does it differ from our traditional understanding of software freedom?\n- Are there any reasons to tolerate use restrictions in AI model licenses that we would reject for FOSS?\n- Proposed normative definitions of free/open AI and related efforts, including the OSI’s OSAID 1.0, FSF’s criteria for free machine learning applications, and the Model Openness Framework\n- Should we have different tiers of free-ness/openness when assessing AI models/systems?\n- Leaving aside the question of source code, are there other kinds of artifacts that should be released with a model for it to legitimately be considered free/open?</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>The Digital Markets Act mandates that mobile gatekeepers open their device operating systems to competing app stores. This affects the landscape of app distribution on iOS and Android and has brought about a variety of different compliance efforts, most of which have been found lacking by regulators thus far. The law is important for Free Software, as its obligations grant smaller Free Software projects the rights to demand access to gatekeepers' infrastructure like enabling alternative app store, sideloading and un-installation of software and interoperability with operating systems.</p>\n<p>This talk will outline the current state of compliance efforts on the part of Apple and iOS, the primary areas where they are deemed insufficient, and how they effectively block any marketplace from emerging as a viable source of FOSS software distribution for the iPhone and iPad. Financial preconditions, ongoing fees, enforced DRM, centralized notarization app review, and other factors all conspire together to maintain the status quo of monopolistic control over the app marketplace on these devices.</p>\n<p>The App Fair Project (appfair.org) is a non-profit charity with the mission of creating an app marketplace for the distribution of digital public goods in the form of free and open-source mobile applications. We have been active in the various workshops and working groups that have examined the DMA compliance efforts on the part of the mobile OS gatekeepers, and have provided technical advice and expertise to groups such as the Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE) and the NGI TALER project.</p>",

The law includes several obligations to tackle unfair practices and improve market contestability addressed at companies considered \"gatekeepers\" of digital markets in the EU. </p>\n<p>The DMA creates new opportunities impacting Free Software, like the obligations to allow alternative app stores, the prohibition of non-removable pre-installed software, the enabling of side-loading of software in devices, and interoperability rules regarding software and hardware.</p>\n<p>The European Commission is the main authority responsible for implementing and oversight the DMA. The Commission has been investigating companies like Apple, Google and Meta due to their behaviour and practices.</p>\n<p>This fireside chat will provide the audience the opportunity to interact with Commission's officers working directly with the DMA. The session will focus on the legal and technical challenges the Commission faces for DMA compliance, in particular: (a) Enabling alternative app stores in iPhones and iPads; (b) Enhancing interoperability in Apple devices; (c) Breaking lock-ins by leveling the playing field for smaller Free Software projects against gatekeeper commercial practices.</p>\n<p>The format consists of:  (1) a short presentation by the Commission's officers on the importance of DMA for Free Software contributors; (2) A longer Q&amp;A session together with the audience moderated by Dr. Lucas Lasota about the technical and legal aspects of the DMA.</p>\n<p>This fireside chat will provide valuable insights for the audience on the work of regulators in Europe, and how they implement key legislation for Free Software.</p>",

The open source world has faced and continues to face the challenge of keeping up. </p>\n<p>We have therefore extended the Wikimedia VisualEditor with real-time editing for the MediaWiki distribution BlueSpice. The result is a freely available, 100% open source solution for real-time editing, which is based on the most popular wiki software. </p>\n<p>In this talk we will provide a first, thoroughly self-critical field report: we will show which technical problems had to be solved, we will report on use cases and initial experiences and on the impact on knowledge sharing with wikis. For example, questions of version control and accountability had to be redefined. Was it worth the effort? Definitely.</p>",

This talk will explain what ocaps is and why you should use it.</p>\n<p>Our current model of collaboration is broken.  Rather than basing our systems on granting consent, we base them on revoking authority.  Ocaps inverts this model with its \"if you don't have it, you can't use it\" approach, facilitated by restricted means of exchanging authority.  Meanwhile, the Object Capability Network protocol (<a href=\"https://ocapn.org/\">OCapN</a>) abstracts away transport mechanisms between objects while creating a security barrier with minimal overhead.  Altogether, this ocaps ecosystem enables secure collaboration in mutually-suspicious contexts by emphasizing and enforcing a consent-based approach to information and authority exchange.  Spritely is pioneering new tooling for ocaps with its <a href=\"https://spritely.institute/goblins/\">Goblins</a> library, which also serves as a model for other implementations; and has plans for solutions to problems like distributed storage, identity management, and even social networking.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>The RISC-V ecosystem currently relies on multiple disconnected repositories and specifications, including the assembly manual, opcode database, formal specifications like Sail and the non-machine readable ISA manual. This fragmentation of information is error prone and makes it hard for hardware designers, researchers, and tool developers to efficiently find, modify, and verify essential data. To address these challenges, we introduce the RISC-V Unified Database (UDB), a single, machine-readable source that consolidates and cross-validates RISC-V specifications against established resources like binutils and riscv-opcodes. Built through collaboration between engineers at industry-leading companies, the UDB already generates version-specific ISA manuals, instruction indexes, and standardized opcode definitions. Ongoing work extends to generating simulator configurations for QEMU and other instruction set simulators. The UDB's YAML-based format ensures broad compatibility and positions it as a foundation for next-generation RISC-V tools. This approach is starting to gain traction with official RISC-V working groups, including the Certification Steering Committee, which already uses the UDB for generating certification requirements. This talk explores UDB’s architecture, showcases its use cases, and invites you to contribute to this transformative project for the RISC-V community.</p>",

To the curious who have briefly pondered such things as the package names and errors go scrolling by, this talk is aimed at you!  It will explain how Python packages are built and why upstream projects do not provide versions of their packages for riscv64 devices.

    "abstract": "<p>AI is everywhere and especially open source is accelerating capabilities and delivering new breakthroughs in Models, making them smaller yet more powerful. While there is a big focus on the next big thing in Software, many overlook the goldrush in Hardware.\nYou may have heard of companies like Nvidia, AMD or Axelera.AI, they are some of the ones selling the shovels to the diggers for a great profit margin. Have you ever wondered what it take to make your own chip? \nSo how to get started on your AI startup? The good news is: there is RISC-V, an open standard for CPUs, so everyone cam implement their own CPU and use common library software (in theory).  The even better news is there is an non profit open source organization called OpenHW Foundation offering high quality Apache 2.0 (or Solderpad) CPU Cores you can take as is, modify as needed and collaborate with a big community.\nEven better, the OpenHW Foundation is offering small platforms to debug on FPGA's but also has QEMU support and various other Models for example system Verilog cycle accurate SystemC Models. On top of this we also provide the Software eco system you need to brign your chip up and running quickly and sell it to one of the big Datacenter Companies, or just keep it running in your basement, heating your house and providing awesome AI edge capabilities for you and your family!\nIn this talk Flo will highlight the current trends in chip development and how open source is accelerating this from the Cores to the EDA tools for designing but also open source tapeouts and then focus a little more on some of the Cores in OpenWH and how you can utilize it. Dr Jeremy Bennett world famous for his 45min overviews on \"how to get GNU GCC ported on a totally new Architecture\" is joining to deliver an overview which Software you need to run on your Chip, to develop your Chip and why it is easy with the OpenHW Group.\nLast but not least we will spill the beans on how the European Union is supportign our work as a non profit (and also for profits in that context) to guarantee sovereignty and enable academic but also research and industrial to build and innovate on a common platform via the Chips JU and programs like TRISTAN and how you can benefit, no matter if you quickly develop a MCU in your Master, need to do some measurements on real RISC-V Cores for your PhD and prove how to boost performance or if you join the real business selling shovels to all the diggers.\nBelieve us, this talk will be a wild ride deep into the Hardware realm of RISC-V and OpenHW and make you start your own Chip while you are still listening!</p>",

Despite the unavailability of current-generation hardware with H Extensions, Advanced Interrupt Architecture (AIA), and IOMMU support, we are proactively building and testing our stack in preparation for future hardware releases. Centered around the rust-vmm framework, we enable lightweight hypervisors like Dragonball, StratoVirt, Cloud-Hypervisor, and Firecracker—all designed to provide high performance, strong isolation, and virtualization-based security. Integrating these hypervisors with Kata Containers, we explore virtualization-based isolation of containerized workloads on RISC-V. By simulating hardware environments and leveraging forward-compatible software designs, we aim to be fully prepared for the introduction of real RISC-V hardware that meets RVA23 standard and RISC-V Server Platform specification, ensuring a seamless deployment path for confidential computing and secure cloud-native platforms.</p>",

However, due to inherent limitations — such as the missing Time-To-Live (TTL) information — we sometimes had to resort to alternative APIs like <code>DNSQuery_A</code> on Windows.\nWhen implementing DNS over HTTPS (DoH), we developed our own DNS parser, which allowed Firefox to also resolve TXT and HTTPS records. But DoH isn't available to all our users.\nWith HTTPS records becoming increasingly important, we decided to resolve HTTPS queries using system APIs like <code>DNSQuery_A</code>, <code>res_query</code>, <code>res_nquery</code>, and <code>android_res_query</code>, with the expectation that this would cover all supported platforms. This talk will delve into the lessons learned from this journey and explain why these platform specific APIs often fall short of expectations.</p>",

Most services require you to confirm your email address, but nowadays, some services also demand a proof of domain ownership.  Sometimes you need to prove write access to a website.  Registration gets much harder, and we have to do it so often.  Time to rethink.</p>\n<p>We have been used to creating usernames for three decades by now, but the practice has reached it limits: users need to do much more to get access to a service.  A tiny simplification is offered via OpenID (\"Login via Google\"), but the new Open Console project offers a more integrated solution to build a trust relation between a person and a service provider.</p>\n<p>In Open Console, a person (or group) collects personal (and group) facts, and can share them with the requirements of the service.  When the service only needs a proven email-address, it only gets that email address, not your name.  The negotiation about which data is delivered is totally transparent and far more diverse.</p>\n<p>Besides personal facts, many different kinds of proofs can be maintained, like a proof of website-ownership.  You only need to prove ownership once, and this can be shared with any service which requires it.</p>\n<p>Proving website ownership is not easy. The focus of this talk is on the process of establishing this proof. There are many complications in checking the validity of a website. We implemented different approaches for this proof (via DNS, HTML-meta, and file).  We would also like to discuss the possible proofs of domain and network (ip-range) ownership with the participants: how to express them in DNS.</p>\n<p>Open Console received support from NGI OpenWebSearch.EU and the NLnet Foundation.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Developing features in the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) often involves modifying multiple files across various locations within the codebase. This fragmentation can make the process of building, debugging, flashing, and testing changes time-consuming and complex. To address this challenge, Google introduced the concept of vendor APEX (Android Pony EXpress) modules, which aim to simplify and streamline the development process.\nVendor APEX: Bundling Feature Areas\nVendor APEX modules provide a solution by allowing developers to package entire feature implementations, such as the WiFi HAL, into a single, self-contained unit. This approach offers several advantages:\nFaster Iteration: Developers can build and push individual vendor APEX modules to test changes, eliminating the need to rebuild the entire vendor image.\nSimplified Testing: The bundling of a feature area into an APEX simplifies the process of building, pushing, and testing changes for that specific functionality.\nEasier Debugging: When issues arise, developers can more easily debug or revert changes by working with a single APEX module rather than navigating through multiple system components.\nModular Updates: Device manufacturers can easily select and combine independently-built vendor APEXes, facilitating the creation of customized vendor images.\nBenefits for Developers\nBy adopting the vendor APEX approach, developers can experience significant improvements in their workflow:\nFocused Development: Developers can concentrate on a specific feature area without worrying about the complexities of the entire system.\nReduced Build Times: Building and pushing a single APEX module is much faster than rebuilding and flashing the whole vendor image.\nStreamlined Debugging: Isolating features in APEX modules makes it easier to identify and resolve issues.\nFlexible Testing: Developers can easily install older versions of an APEX to compare behavior and isolate problems.\nIn conclusion, vendor APEX modules address the challenges of fragmented AOSP development by providing a more efficient, modular approach. This solution not only simplifies the development process but also enhances productivity by allowing developers to focus on specific feature areas without the overhead of managing the entire system</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>If you want to use Android for your custom project, then you are almost inevitably going to have to modify the platform code. Typical reasons include supporting specialised hardware, running dedicated system services and pre-installing system apps. AOSP, and some parts of the Board Support Packages, are open source, so what's stopping you just changing the bits you need to? Indeed, this is the standard development model for Android platforms: fork; modify; repeat. Of course, we all know that forking is bad but there isn't any choice, especially when it is so difficult up merge changes upstream</p>\n<p>Well, maybe there is a choice, In this talk we will examine the problems created by simply forking Android, and we will look at various ways to make the process more maintainable. In particular we will look at using local_manifests, and at maintaining out of tree patches for AOSP. In the latter case, we will talk about the tooling required to track patch sets (\"layers\") and the dependencies between them.</p>\n<p>We hope that this will spark a conversation in the community through which we can establish best practice for maintaining custom Android systems without forking</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>The Oniro Project, an open-source operating system built upon OpenHarmony and tailored for European market needs, is expanding its ecosystem to include mobile devices. In this lightning talk, we will discuss the ongoing effort to bring Oniro to the Volla X23 smartphone, focusing on the technical challenges and solutions in adapting Android drivers to a musl libc-based platform.</p>\n<p>We will explore the role of libhybris in enabling compatibility with proprietary Android drivers, a critical step in hardware enablement for Oniro on mobile devices. The presentation will highlight how libhybris bridges the gap between the Bionic and musl libc environments, allowing us to leverage GPU acceleration and other hardware features while maintaining an open-source user space. Key challenges, such as adapting Android’s graphics stack and addressing ABI compatibility issues, will be outlined, along with our current progress in running Oniro in an LXC container for rapid testing.</p>\n<p>This talk will provide insights into the broader implications of this work for the FOSS on Mobile ecosystem, offering a pathway to more accessible open-source mobile platforms. Join us to learn how Oniro aims to contribute to the vision of a truly open mobile ecosystem.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Wireless displays are something most of us use, but in a fragmented and proprietary landscape. We propose a new approach to virtual screen sharing between Linux mobile and desktop devices.</p>\n<p>This solution uses a combination of video pipelines optimized for ARM and x86 hardware, D-Bus, and low-latency UDP streaming to create virtual “second monitors” and stream the desktop between peer devices. It is optimized to be usable even on low-power hardware such as the Librem 5, allowing us to repurpose older devices as secondary network monitors without proprietary tools. [2]</p>\n<p>In this talk, I will try to demystify some of the technicalities required for implementing efficient wireless desktop streaming using GStreamer, PipeWire, and D-Bus. To this end, we will explore how to build network video pipelines from scratch, with a focus on minimizing latency and making good use of hardware acceleration. Finally, we will present the Mirror Hall app, an experimental GTK4 app that encapsulates the above concepts.

The result is that Linux-based mobile platforms beyond Android and iOS have the potential to be more viable than ever before.</p>\n<p>But the embedded browser landscape is in continual flux, with multiple offerings built on different technologies, including Blink, V8, WebKit, JavaScriptCore, Gecko, SpiderMonkey and Servo Layout. On top of these are frameworks intended to make their use more accessible to embedded systems. These include the Chromium Embedded Framework, Web Platform for Embedded, Qt WebEngine and Gecko WebView.</p>\n<p>In this talk I'll look at the different offerings available and consider their appropriateness for mobile Linux. What features do they offer, how practical is their use and why should you choose one over another? In particular I'll look at the minimal API needed for any practical implementation, how the APIs differ across the offerings and how they can be made use of as embedded browsers in mobile applications.</p>\n<p>To give a more complete understanding of what embedded browsers are like to use in practice, the talk will include example applications with demonstration code.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Bots and spam are challenges for online platforms. Traditional CAPTCHAs help block bots, but often involve improving proprietary maps and software, while exposing user information to third-party CAPTCHA providers. OpenStreetMap (OSM) has many objects remaining to be mapped, but the quality of AI-generated objects is not high enough for direct inclusion. We introduce “MapTCHA”, a CAPTCHA that leverages the uncertainty of interpreting imagery with computer vision, and provides human verification for AI predictions: users are asked to identify images containing correctly interpreted objects, e.g. building outlines.</p>\n<p>We separate known positive cases, where both the AI prediction and OSM contain an object, from unknown cases, where objects are only in the prediction. We also generate known negatives from areas where objects are neither in OSM nor in the prediction. We show a mix of these images without telling the user which are which. Humans are validated by confirming the known positives and negatives, and we determine the truth of the unknown images by aggregating users’ responses through voting. When the voting indicates high confidence that an object exists, we suggest the location for OSM mapping.</p>\n<p>Our prototype identifies buildings using aerial imagery with high enough resolution to visualise individual buildings and medium-sized objects. Image recognition is provided by fAIr, an open-source AI-assisted mapping system developed by the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT). It allows the training and fine-tuning of pre-trained machine learning models to segment building footprints.</p>\n<p>Future plans include expanding to more objects and types of imagery; refining AI models; integrating MapTCHA into various login systems; and enhancing the user interface.</p>\n<p>In this session we will talk about how we are building this solution, how it might enhance mapping efforts in OSM that will support projects on the ground, and some of the challenges of working with AI derived data.</p>",

I have, unfortunately, and it was only later that I realised that not only they had a floor plan online - but they had a navigation app for that building. The reality is that a user who is not familiar with a building will not find such an app until it's too late. Indoor environments sometimes have public floorplans available via some service. Similarly, more and more indoor positioning systems are being deployed in buildings to provide navigation services or asset tracking. However, as a person visiting a building, you are often not aware that these services exist or where to find them. Even if some global registry exists to discover this data, it is often proprietary, discouraging developers from interfacing with such systems. I want to bring a shift into the landscape of indoor positioning systems and services and solve this! In this presentation, I will talk about discovering indoor environments and positioning systems through local and global discovery methods, linked data and personal data vaults. How nice would it be, that instead of downloading the FOSDEM app, you simply use Google Maps or any open-source navigation application to find the location of this talk?</p>",

It encourages researchers, developers, and organizations to use these products for various applications, from scientific studies to practical environmental monitoring solutions. These products include but are not limited to, Sentinel data, Digital Elevation Models (DEMs), mosaics, and service products like biophysical parameters such as FAPAR (Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation). In addition to these products, the ecosystem also provides a range of tools, including cloud-computing environments and APIs, to simplify and enhance the usability of Earth Observation data.\nIn this session, we will explore how, in addition to freely available data, the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem provides several open-source capabilities to simplify and enhance EO data usability. These include a cloud-computing environment like JupyterLab, a user-friendly Copernicus Browser for easy data exploration, and APIs like STAC and openEO for streamlined data access and integration. By offering these resources openly, the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem supports a growing community of users, helping them turn satellite data into actionable knowledge to address global challenges.</p>",

The library supports simpler geometry types like points lines and polygons, but also more complex modes like rectangles, circles and sectors. There is also advanced functionalities like snapping, rotation, and scaling, which often require significant effort to implement from scratch. These functionalities are designed to \"just work\" across the different mapping ecosystems.</p>\n<p>The library’s modular design promotes extensibility, allowing developers to create custom drawing modes and adapters for new mapping libraries that may come along. Thanks to its decoupled architecture, any mode can work with any adapter, creating a multiplier effect. This flexibility also ensures that swapping out one mapping library should be much simpler, as the drawing logic is abstracted away from the mapping library.</p>\n<p>In this talk, we’ll explore the origins of Terra Draw, demonstrate how to get started, and provide a glimpse of what's possible with it. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting with web maps, you'll walk away with practical insights on how Terra Draw can be used in your project.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Geospatial programming often requires stitching together a variety of formats, interfaces, APIs, libraries, tools and languages.   How can we fluidly download data from OpenStreetMap using the Overpass Query Language, run performant queries with GEOS, calculate projections with PROJ, store and manipulate GeoJSON or WKT-formatted data with duckdb's spatial extention, and then visualize things with a javascript library like Leaflet or Deck.gl?  This talk explores Raku's expressive and powerful style as we mesh together all of these things, creating new modules along the way, and leapfrogging ahead of other implementations with some of Raku's unique features such as NativeCall for native libraries, Grammars for parsing, multiple modes of interacting with command line tooling, and plentiful concurrency models.   Also let's see how we can reign in large language models so that we can apply them judiciously to our data and our code.</p>\n<p>Links:</p>\n<p>https://raku.land/zef:bduggan/GEOS\nhttps://raku.land/cpan:BDUGGAN/Geo::Basic\nhttps://raku.land/zef:bduggan/WebService::Overpass\nhttps://raku.land/zef:kjpye/Geo::Geometry\nhttps://raku.land/zef:bduggan/Duckie\nhttps://github.com/bduggan/raku-proj</p>",

A typical output of such models is an estimate of the social cost of greenhouse gas emissions, a measure of the economic damage caused over its lifetime by a ton of greenhouse gas such as CO2 or CH4. </p>\n<p>META, however, computes many other economic as well as geophysical indicators. As its name suggests, META was built specifically to estimate the economic impact of tipping points in the climate system. To do so, META incorporates different tipping points modules, each of which replicate a geophysically realistic tipping point module from a study in the climate economics research literature. </p>\n<p>META was originally introduced in Dietz, Rising, Stoerk and Wagner (2021, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2103081118), and has since been updated and ported to Julia using the Mimi Framework. Follow-up research has improved several components of META. Similarly, META estimates have been used to inform conversations with authorities in the EU and the US. </p>\n<p>In this talk, I will give a short overview of META's structure, its capabilities, and ideas for the community on how to further improve and use META for open research in the future. </p>\n<p>META is freely available on Github under a GPL-3.0 copyleft licence: https://github.com/openmodels/META</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>This presentation aims at presenting a fully open-source pipeline to extract, curate, and explore web archives, a captive data source whose access is restricted. Its purpose is to detail both the technical pipeline and the socio-institutional setting that made it possible to emerge, highlighting the challenges of developing open tools for closed sources.</p>\n<p>The French web archives is an institutional repository of data maintained by the French National Library (BnF). It contains more than 2 petabytes of data spanning over close to 30 years, which accounts to more than 50 billion web pages. Access to this data is restricted under the heritage and legal deposit law: academic researchers willing to work on web archives as data are expected to submit research projects that, upon a formal or informal agreement, will enable them to access this data. But what then?\nBuilding the methodological means to pursue epistemological goals in that context is particularly challenging. Web archivists do provide toolkits for exploration. Recent initiatives have scaled up the effort to make these sources more accessible. The RESPADON project has successfully managed to build a “captive web archive” capacity into the Hyphe software, and in doing so has opened a new way into developing tools for such data.</p>\n<p>In this presentation, we will present a new solution to extensively study, at the qualitative level, specific topics in the full-text indexed collections of the French web archives. Built around the PANDORÆ software, this pipeline has been designed to interrogate the captive data source on site, but also extract relevant metadata in a compliant manner to enable its exploration off-site, while ensuring reproducibility by publishing the code. In doing so, this pipeline provides an up-to-date example of the “one-way mirror” situation of building open tools that are fit to operate on closed data sources.</p>",

As the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) produces vast datasets and as analyses evolve, reproducibility becomes crucial for both current and future research efforts. Rivet (Robust Independent Validation of Experiment and Theory) addresses this challenge by providing a framework for the preservation and reinterpretation of LHC analyses. This talk will discuss how Rivet facilitates analysis preservation, enabling researchers to reproduce, validate, and reuse complex particle collision studies long after initial publication. We’ll explore specific use cases, including how Rivet supports reinterpretation for new physics searches, and the technical underpinnings that make Rivet an indispensable tool for long-term data analysis preservation. This presentation will emphasise Rivet’s role within the broader landscape of open science and data preservation, with insights into its integration with other high-energy physics frameworks. Attendees will gain a clear understanding of Rivet’s contributions to sustainable research practices and reproducibility within the scientific community.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>The talk will introduce CartABl https://igarun.univ-nantes.io/CartABl/ , a free (GPL) web-based authoring tool for creating interactive maps and figures, and discuss its impact on user workflows and design decisions. Designed primarily for geographers and cartographers, CartABl also serves broader communities seeking to produce interactive cartographic content. It addresses the technical barrier that coding poses to creating interactive cartographic content (using js) through a graphical interface for defining interactions. It integrates seamlessly with traditional workflows by enhancing maps created in vector graphics editors like Inkscape or Adobe Illustrator with interactivity, without requiring programming knowledge. CartABl leverages SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) as its base format, embedding interactive rules as declarative elements interpreted by a lightweight JavaScript runtime. This results in standalone, browser-compatible interactive SVG files, preserving the scalability and versatility of the format.</p>\n<p>The development of CartABl follows an instrumental genesis approach, where tool and user co-evolve through iterative feedback. Initial prototypes allowed basic interactivity like tooltips and layer toggling. Feedback from its application in projects such as L’Atlas Bleu, a journal focused on coastal and marine maps, guides its refinement. This iterative process not only improves the tool but also influences how cartographers structure and design their graphical maps and figures: the structure of the graphical objects must be adapted to facilitate the definition of interaction rules, and the interactive features proposed by the tool impact the design decisions of the users.</p>\n<p>CartABl aims to democratize interactive cartography, making it accessible and intuitive for professionals and non-experts alike. By transforming workflows and expanding the possibilities of digital cartographic publishing, it stands out as a valuable resource for advancing geographic and graphic research and communication.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Panoptic is a tool to explore locally and easily big images datasets: https://github.com/CERES-Sorbonne/Panoptic\nImages abound on the web and digital social networks. Their proliferation is one of the characteristics of digital culture. In particular, they are widely mobilized in contemporary controversies, with the aim of revealing and debating important social issues. Far beyond natively digital images, whether moving or still, images are first and foremost an object of study in their own in many disciplines (art history, film studies...), just as they can be a way of accessing a research field (photographs of animal and plant species, pages from digitized books...). A key challenge for the human and social sciences is to equip themselves with tools for exploring, sorting and annotating image corpora.</p>\n<p>While a number of tools already exist for working with such corpora (XnView, Tropy, voxel51, Aikon, Arkindex<strong>,</strong> for example), a key issue to be resolved is the multiplication in the number of images we work with: how can we efficiently explore, sort and annotate a corpus of several tens of thousands of images? How can we provide researchers with a tool that facilitates such work?</p>\n<p>Indeed, working with a large number of images means first of all having a synoptic view of them, in order to understand them as a whole, but also being able to manipulate them directly in the presentation interface (for both exploration and analysis).</p>\n<p>Secondly, working with a large number of images also imposes time constraints on analysis, which can be resolved by using similar-image clustering tools (computer vision tools), to group together images that have formal similarities (reduces exploration time), but also by using batch annotation functionalities (reduces analysis time).</p>\n<p>Finally, working with images is rarely just about working with images, but also with textual data associated with the images (texts of tweets, photographer's name, shooting date, etc.). Another challenge, then, is to adopt a plurisemiotic approach to the content of the corpus being worked on, in order to avoid having to move back and forth between different work spaces.</p>\n<p>Created at CERES, by developers, researchers and designers, Panoptic is an open source tool for visualizing, exploring and annotating large images corpora. In particular, the tool integrates algorithms for grouping images by similarity (by using ml model CLIP), to help users with sorting and exploration. The tool also offers various filtering, search and annotation options, enabling the creation, analysis and export of sub-corpora.</p>\n<p>Our talk will present the tool we have developed, and how its various functions are designed to meet the methodological needs of research using tools for working with large volumes of images.</p>",

Recently, the open-source movement has expanded beyond software, encompassing the release of code, data, and AI models, further accelerating progress across diverse fields. However, in healthcare, open-sourcing faces distinct challenges, including navigating regulatory hurdles to meet industry standards, ensuring robust patient data protection, managing the costs of specialised hardware and software maintenance, and addressing the limited availability of expert clinicians needed to annotate, test, and validate AI innovations.\nIn this talk, Miguel will explore how open-source technologies are advancing healthcare, with a focus on medical and surgical innovations. He will highlight key advancements while exploring the complexities of clinical translation, using three of his projects as examples: Fetal Ultrasound Image Synthesis, endoscopy-based video analysis for surgery, and real-time AI diagnosis of eye movement disorders. The talk will examine the challenges of clinical translation and showcase examples of innovative technologies that leverage open-source software, models, and data to address some of the most complex problems in healthcare. Finally, to inspire and spark innovation among the next generation of engineers, researchers, and clinicians from academia and industry, this talk will showcase how the emerging open-source software community for surgical and medical technologies is striving to: (a) Foster Collaboration and Community Building, (b) Enhance Security and Transparency, (c) Promote Customisation and Flexibility, (d) Ensure Cost-Effectiveness, Sustainability, and Scalability, and (e) Drive Rapid Innovation and Future-Proofing.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>This presentation introduces Active Tigger, an open-source research tool designed to accelerate collaborative text annotation in the social sciences.</p>\n<p>The increasing use of text-as-data in social science research has created a pressing need for efficient annotation tools. While small datasets can be manually annotated, the exponential growth in available textual data (e.g., from newspapers and social media) demands solutions that enable collaborative annotation and automation. Moreover, the emergence of generative AI and large language models (LLMs) has highlighted the importance of robust corpus annotation practices, particularly for evaluating prompt-engineered outputs from LLM-as-a-service platforms like OpenAI or Hugging Face.</p>\n<p>To address these challenges, we created an annotation platform, Active Tigger. A first version was developed in 2022 using R and RShiny (J. Boelaert, GitLab Repository). This tool embeds several annotation heuristics, including active learning—iteratively predicting and selecting annotations to maximize training quality—to help researchers build training datasets in order to fine-tuning encoder models. The tool quickly became integral to the research team's activities and beyond, which incited us to develop of a second, more robust version.</p>\n<p>The current iteration of Active Tigger, built with a Python-based API and a React frontend, introduces enhanced flexibility and scalability. It supports collaborative workflows, accommodates a broader range of use cases, and is now in beta testing, with early adopters exploring its potential.</p>\n<p>This presentation will cover three key aspects:</p>\n<p>The journey of Active Tigger: From addressing specific social science needs to adapting to the evolving landscape of LLMs.\nShowcase: Demonstrating the annotation workflow using active learning and BERT fine-tuning.\nFuture directions: Exploring the tool's evolution in the context of widespread LLM availability, discussing the trade-offs between focusing on specialized tasks and enabling broader applications.</p>\n<p>Github repository of Active Tigger : https://github.com/emilienschultz/activetigger</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Systematic literature reviews are essential for evidence-based research, but they are often slow and require a lot of effort. Motivated by the potential of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology, our team from Georgia Tech's Master in Computer Science program, with early guidance from researchers at Robert Gordon University, created PICO Scholar. This AI-powered platform helps researchers by turning their queries into embeddings, matching them with a semantic vector database, and pulling out important research details—Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome (PICO). It ranks relevant studies and offers a chatbot powered by RAG for exploring documents more deeply. Future updates aim to add features for real-time collaboration, making it easier for teams to work together on reviewing literature.</p>\n<p>PICO Scholar uses a solid microservices setup with Red Hat OpenShift AI, boosted by Intel’s OpenVINO toolkit. It runs models like SciBERT for embeddings and TinyLlama for generating text, managed by ModelMesh. LlamaIndex organizes embeddings into a TiDB VectorStore for smarter searches, and fine-tuned adapters improve accuracy for specific fields. MinIO S3 supports smooth model storage, and the platform’s microservice design makes it scalable and resource-efficient.</p>\n<p>What makes PICO Scholar stand out is not just its technology but its focus on community and collaboration. Built during two hackathons - including a 2nd place win at the Red Hat &amp; Intel AI Hackathon - with changing team members and diverse skills, the project follows open-source principles, encouraging contributions from all backgrounds. Our goal is to make powerful research tools accessible to everyone, helping researchers worldwide speed up discoveries. By continuing to improve PICO Scholar, we hope to support the scientific community and build a platform that grows and evolves to meet its needs.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/datagero/pico-scholar\">PICO Scholar GitHub repository</a></p>",

    "abstract": "<p>In January 2018, inspired by similar initiatives, a group of enthusiastic researchers at the Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO) launched a coding club. The <a href=\"https://coding-club.inbo.be/\">INBO coding club</a> was, is, and will continue to be a welcoming space for anyone interested in learning more about programming and data analysis, with a particular focus on ecological and environmental topics.</p>\n<p>Our goal has always been to foster an environment of collaborative experimentation, where participants share code, learn from one another, and grow together—regardless of their level of experience. Everyone is encouraged to contribute, express their ideas freely, and engage as equals. We firmly believe that learning is a mutual process, independent of expertise levels, and that doing it together is not only more effective but also more enjoyable.</p>\n<p>More than seven years—and a pandemic—later, the INBO R Coding Club remains vibrant and thriving. We are excited to share the strategies that have helped sustain this initiative, transforming initial enthusiasm into a widely recognized and enduring effort both within and beyond INBO. </p>\n<p>Key lessons learned include:\n<strong>Learn together</strong>: Create a supportive space where every question is valued, and mistakes are celebrated as opportunities for growth.\n<strong>As live as possible, as remote as necessary</strong>: Live coding in the same room is far more engaging and effective than remote sessions.\n<strong>Community-driven evolution</strong>: The club should always prioritize the needs of its community, with feedback playing a central role in shaping its activities.\n<strong>Dedication</strong>: A committed core team is essential for the consistent and sustainable organization of club activities.\n<strong>Full openness</strong>: All session materials—including slides, code, and recordings—are freely available to everyone.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>In an era driven by data and digital collaboration, access to foundational research skills is increasingly essential—yet research capacity remains deeply unequal across the globe. For instance, Africa has only 20 health researchers per million people, compared to 246 per million in Europe, according to the World Health Organization’s Global Observatory on Health Research and Development. This stark disparity highlights the urgent need for accessible, inclusive research training to bridge the gap in global knowledge production.</p>\n<p>Pre-Seeds (Research 101) is an open-source, community-driven initiative inspired by OLS’s capacity-building programs, such as <a href=\"https://we-are-ols.org/openseeds\">Open Seeds</a> and <a href=\"http://we-are-ols.org/nebula\">Nebula</a>. The course is designed to break down barriers to research literacy and amplify underrepresented voices in open science. It is targeted at research enthusiasts, citizen scientists, early-career researchers, and Research Software Engineers (RSEs) from non-academic backgrounds. </p>\n<p>Currently in its early stages, Pre-seeds aims to create a flexible, modular curriculum covering key aspects of research often taken for granted, such as research design, ethical considerations, data management, and collaborative practices. The project leverages open tools like GitHub to promote collaboration, transparency, and reproducibility, inviting broad participation across disciplines and experience levels.</p>\n<p>This session will present Pre-Seeds as a growing, collaborative effort to build an inclusive research ecosystem. By showcasing the project’s vision and its potential real-world applications, we’ll open the floor to feedback and invite attendees to join us in shaping this initiative—whether through expertise, funding, or community engagement—to co-create a more diverse and accessible future for open science.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>In the digital age, the pervasive presence of the internet has fundamentally altered the landscape of capitalism, knowledge and human communication. However, alongside its transformative potential, voluntary data sharing in the public interest, or data donation, is plagued by systemic issues, ranging from lack of trust and privacy breaches to legal uncertainty, undermining its intended role as a democratizing force. </p>\n<p>Recognizing this brokenness, we turn to the concept of digital repair as a lens through which to understand and address these deficiencies. Drawing from social innovation and data governance theories, this abstract advances the sociology of repair centered on the concept of data altruism, the new EU framework for voluntary data sharing for objectives of general interest, including scientific research purposes. This talk explores the potential of data donation as a means to not only rectify the fractures in the digital data ecosystem, but also to stimulate a more socially sustainable data economy. </p>\n<p>By conceptualizing data donation within the framework of sociology of repair, this talk proposes its implications for reframing data agency, and advancing notions of digital constitutionalism. This talk is explicitly an effort to facilitate discussion about useful and plausible conceptual tools to theorize data donation. Through an ethnographically-informed investigation, this talk contributes to an understanding of the infrastructure enabling data altruism for scientific research purposes in the Netherlands, offering insights that are fruitful for navigating future research journeys into the European data economy.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Modern slavery impacts millions of people worldwide, posing urgent ethical and human rights challenges In response, the UK and Australian Modern Slavery Acts require companies meeting specific revenue thresholds to produce annual modern slavery statements, aiming to increase accountability in addressing modern slavery risks. Since 2016, Walk Free and Wikirate have partnered to assess companies’ response to these Acts, leveraging Wikirate’s open-data platform. This assessment considers whether companies are releasing statements that meet the legal requirements, but also if they detail policies and actions that go beyond compliance to enable businesses to better respond to modern slavery. Key to this initiative is its open, collaborative approach, and therefore, a set of accessible metrics on Wikirate that empowers non-expert researchers to contribute meaningfully. Through the project, volunteers and researchers have conducted an in-depth analysis of over 2000 MSA statements. Over the years, the project has mobilized thousands of volunteers and engaged over 20 universities worldwide, using Wikirate’s crowdsourcing platform to organize and perform research at scale. The insights generated through the research not only inform Walk Free’s advocacy efforts with governments and companies but also demonstrate the power of open research principles in tackling complex global issues.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>The \"Do No Harm\" principle, well-established in fields like medical research, healthcare, and humanitarian aid, has significant potential to improve the quality and reduce the negative effects of open research practices and technology.</p>\n<p>As open research/science practices become a norm across different disciplines, it is important to identify, improve awareness of, and reduce its known or unintended negative impacts on people and their communities. While efforts like ethical source licenses (like the Do No Harm and Hippocratic License) are yet to become an acceptable legal pathway to enforcing responsible practices in open source, more general adoption and use of the \"Do No Harm\" will help account for societal and environmental implications of research and technology.</p>\n<p>In this talk, I will introduce a “do no harm” framework to identify risks and develop actionable plans to mitigate the negative impacts of open research practices and technology. This framework examines the development and deployment of technology across four critical areas: the actors involved or affected, the dynamics and relationships within impacted communities, the economic realities faced by researchers, and environmental impact. Additionally, I will highlight practical methods for addressing the potential negative consequences of our work.</p>\n<p>This session is designed for anyone involved in open source/science, including researchers, designers, contributors, developers, maintainers, and community members who seek to better understand and navigate the ethical challenges of open research and technology. Attendees will gain insights into global disparities in technology and explore how they can share responsibility to ensure their work promotes more equitable benefits by combining open practices with the do-no-harm principle.</p>",

There is a growing trend to leverage object storage systems such as  AWS S3 for architecting cost-effective, performant and scalable systems. S3 is a large-scale, high throughput key-value storage system, which it trades for a slightly higher latency. In this session we will present techniques used to leverage S3 for a low latency scalable distributed SQL database, in particular how  to get around S3’s high latency by leveraging a novel new LSM Cloud Storage Engine that uses EBS as a cache to lower latency.</p>",

For many, vertical scaling has reached its limits, leaving fundamental architectural changes as the only option. Vitess, with its built-in horizontal sharding capabilities, provides a seamless path for organizations to scale beyond the constraints of legacy MySQL or Aurora clusters.\nThis talk explores how Vitess enables smooth migrations from Aurora and MySQL into Kubernetes clusters with near-zero downtime. We will begin with an overview of Vitess’ architecture, highlighting horizontal sharding and its advantages for scaling. Next, we will dive into the powerful workflows Vitess provides for data import and live production migrations, emphasizing their safety, efficiency, and reversibility—even for massive datasets.</p>\n<p>To ground these concepts, we will share real-world examples of successful migrations from web-scale Aurora and legacy MySQL databases, including performance metrics, data sizes, and challenges encountered. Attendees will gain practical insights and a clear blueprint for transitioning large-scale database systems to Vitess, unlocking unprecedented scalability and operational agility.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p><a href=\"https://github.com/ckolderup/postmarks\">Postmarks</a> is a piece of Fediverse software meant to provide a social bookmarking platform along the lines of De.licio.us and its successors. Despite the published ActivityPub spec having in mind a variety of verbs and nouns, and the ability to create \"extensions\", most software that I found while looking around in the early days of Postmarks looked to be recreating \"timeline-based social media\", where the primary activity took place on the platform itself and involved reading content from other users and generating more content of the same expectations. This is not to say there are none, but how much they expect to integrate with platforms like Mastodon varies.</p>\n<p>When thinking about what that meant for Postmarks, deciding how interoperability should work presents some interesting questions. There are opportunities in interoperability: even if you're not the kind of person to whom the activity of bookmarking and curating links is interesting, you may know someone who does whose work you want to follow, which you can then do from Mastodon. On the flipside, you may be a researcher who spends time collecting information and values the viewpoints of others but doesn't want to take part in a product designed like a traditional social media site. There are also drawbacks: as an individual maintainer with a handful of contributors to my platform, integrating with existing platforms that are already large enough to have abusers, scrapers, and other bad actors opens me up to those problems much sooner than it would if I were creating my own siloed ecosystem. Less urgently, there are new software design questions raised by the functionality of the platforms interacting. How do I make Postmarks content appear on platforms like Mastodon? As I build out the ability to find bookmarkable content from the Fediverse within Postmarks, how do I do that in a way that keeps in mind the ideals of Postmarks rather than the spaces it's connecting to? What choices have been made that add extra requirements on top of the ActivityPub spec in order to make interoperability smooth and consistent? In designing a piece of ActivityPub software designed to have one small \"instance\" that hosts the activity of one \"actor\", I also found myself stumbling across design decisions made in the creation of large platforms like Mastodon and Pixelfed that left me with questions about the ethics of designing software that can interact with those places. How do I prevent my software from becoming a tool for bad actors targeting those places?</p>\n<p>By looking at the design problems introduced within the early development of Postmarks and an analysis of other ActivityPub platforms that have either dealt with, are still working on, or have not faced these questions, we can create space for discussing what a future looks like where a broad variety of ActivityPub software is out on the internet speaking the same protocol but choosing when and how they interact in a way that cultivates communication and works to minimize harm.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>When browsers load a Web page and its subresources, A LOT happens under the hood. They need to take into account render/parsing blocking resources, use a preload scanner, listen to resource hints (like preload/preconnect), loading modifiers (async/defer/module), fetchpriority, responsive images, and much more. Based on all those signals, they then need to somehow decide when to load which resources, to make optimal use of the modern HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 connections. And, as you might have guessed, none of the browsers do this in quite the same way (understatement alert!). Several even intentionally delay requesting some resources until others have been downloaded (<em>shocked face emoji here</em>). </p>\n<p>This talk is a deep dive into how browsers decide when to load a specific resource, and some ways in which you can influence them to modify their behaviour (so you can make sure that important LCP image is definitely one of the first things to come in!). We will look at A LOT of different waterfalls and discuss why each looks the way it does, why browsers often make different decisions, and how to solve common problems (no, don’t just preload everything with fetchpriority=high, you monster!).</p>\n<p>You will walk away with a deeper understanding of what happens under the hood, which will allow you to better deal with the various gotchas and quirks present in today’s browsers and resource loading features.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Scheduling problem arise in many subsystems such as the CPU scheduler, disk IO or Qdisc. Despite extensive research during several decades, this problem remain challenging to solve due to varying workload requirements, diversity of scheduled resources, latency versus throughput considerations, scheduler overhead and many others. For instance, the Linux CPU scheduler continues to evolve.</p>\n<p>In this talk, we’ll explore another scheduling scenario: HTTP streams prioritization. Having that a busy web server can manage millions of TCP connections, each potentially containing hundreds of HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 streams, a pretty efficient stream is essential. It should be fair, say, for progressive JPEGs, but it should prioritize shorter load times for PNG images. It should also be smart enough, particularly if browsers don’t adequately prioritize streams (which is still could be an issue for mainstream browsers in 2024). Additionally, it must be resilient against DDoS attacks.</p>\n<p>This talk will cover the following topics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The different nature of resources, their relationships, and how these factrors affect streams scheduling used for delivering these resources</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fair O(logN) and fast O(1) scheduling algorithms</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Discussions on underlying data structures to optimize the scheduler for a large number of streams</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>HTTP/2 streams prioritization in servers such as Nginx, H2O, nghttp2 (Envoy, Apache HTTPD) and Tempesta FW</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Differences between stream prioritization in HTTP/2 and HTTP/3, along with corresponding RFCs</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>How modern browsers construct stream priority trees</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Server-side optimizations for streams scheduling in Cloudflare and Tempesta FW</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Known vulnerabilities exploiting the HTTP/2 prioritization mechanisms</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

We first demonstrate proper operation by collecting and decoding Iridium messages using gr-iridium, despite the 2 or 3-bit resolution of the IQ ADCs, before demonstrating post-processing and real time processing of GNSS data. Both real time data collection, processing and streaming using GNU Radio and GNSS signal decoding using gnss-sdr are demonstrated. Tomoji Takasu's PocketSDR software provides invaluable insight and our contribution is porting the firmware to sdcc to get rid of any proprietary tool for developing the PocketSDR-like board.</p>\n<p>The coherent multi-receiver architecture allows for processing the same L-band with two antennas for Controlled Radiation Pattern Antenna (CRPA) processing and detecting spoofing by inconsistent direction of arrival ; or processing two bands (e.g. L1/L5 or L1/L2) simultaneously.</p>\n<p>See https://github.com/jmfriedt/max2771_fx2lp/: the subject of this presentation was the core project of the opensource tools for embedded systems development ELISE Master teaching at University of Franche-Comté is Besançon, France.</p>",

I show benchmarks comparing GNU Radio 3.10, GNU Radio 4.0, FutureSDR, this new runtime, and a hand-written ad-hoc implementation, for a class of certain simple flowgraphs. These show that popular runtimes often have a high overhead and that there is much room for improvements in performance.

Using webgraph-rs one can load graphs such as the Software Heritage Merkle DAG (about 0.6 trillion edges ) in less than 200 GiB of RAM and visit it in a few hours with a single core.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Rust's references adhere to a strict \"one exclusive XOR many shared\" model, which gives the language much of its greatest safety guarantees. Reborrowing is a feature that seems on surface to break this rule: An exclusive reference can be turned into shared references and those shared references can be used together with the exclusive reference as long as these are all used as if they were shared references. Only once the exclusive reference is used as exclusive, all the derived or \"reborrowed\" shared references are invalidated. The XOR rule is upheld, but in a way that breaks a literal reading of the rule.</p>\n<p>Usually reborrowing is used temporarily but what if we make it our modus operandi? This talk explores using and slightly abusing reborrowing and comes out the other side with an awkward but functional safepoint garbage collector built upon reborrowing a ZST marker and a whole load of typed indexes.

    "abstract": "<p>In this talk, I will introduce <strong>Syd</strong>, a <a href=\"https://gitlab.exherbo.org/sydbox/sydbox/-/blob/main/COPYING\">GPL-3 licensed</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tigran_Petrosian\">rock-solid</a> application kernel designed for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbox_(computer_security)\">sandboxing</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software\">applications</a> on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux\">Linux</a> systems (version 5.19 and above). Over the past 16 years, Syd has evolved from a tool used within <a href=\"https://www.exherbolinux.org/\">Exherbo Linux</a> to detect package build mishaps into a robust security boundary for applications. The recent rewrite in <a href=\"https://www.rust-lang.org/\">Rust</a> leverages modern Linux APIs such as <a href=\"https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/seccomp_unotify.2.html\"><em>seccomp-unotify(2)</em></a>, <a href=\"https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/openat2.2.html\"><em>openat2(2)</em></a>, and <a href=\"https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/pidfd_getfd.2.html\"><em>pidfd_getfd(2)</em></a> to eliminate <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-of-check_to_time-of-use\">time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTTOU)</a> vulnerabilities, which is essential for building a secure sandbox.</p>\n<p>Syd aims to provide a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle\">simple interface</a> over complex Linux sandboxing mechanisms -- including <a href=\"https://landlock.io/\">Landlock LSM</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_namespaces\">namespaces</a>, <a href=\"https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/ptrace.2.html\"><em>ptrace(2)</em></a>, and <a href=\"https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/seccomp_unotify.2.html\">seccomp-BPF/Notify</a> -- which are often considered <a href=\"https://lwn.net/Articles/796108/\">brittle</a> and <a href=\"https://lwn.net/Articles/795128/\">difficult to use</a>. This approach is somewhat similar to <a href=\"https://www.openbsd.org/\">OpenBSD</a>'s <a href=\"https://man.openbsd.org/pledge.2\"><em>pledge</em>(2)</a> system call, offering a practical way to restrict application behavior. Unlike other sandboxing tools like <a href=\"https://falco.org/\">Falco</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/containers/bubblewrap\">Bubblewrap</a>, <a href=\"https://firejail.wordpress.com/\">Firejail</a>, <a href=\"https://gvisor.dev/\">gVisor</a>, and <a href=\"https://google.github.io/minijail/\">minijail</a>, Syd operates <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privilege_separation\">without requiring extra privileges</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setuid\">SETUID</a> binaries, or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privilege_(computing)\">privileged kernel context</a>. It adheres to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy\">UNIX philosophy</a> of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy#Do_One_Thing_and_Do_It_Well\">doing one thing well</a> with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege\">the least privilege</a> necessary.</p>\n<p>The presentation will cover Syd's key features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Path Sandboxing</strong>: Controls filesystem access through various operations including read, write (with append-only paths and path masking), stat (aka path hiding), tmpfile creation, attribute changes, truncation, node creation, file creation, and deletion.</li>\n<li><strong>Execution Control</strong>: Implements exec sandboxing with SegvGuard, force sandboxing for verified execution, and Trusted Path Execution to enforce strict execution policies.</li>\n<li><strong>Network Sandboxing</strong>: Restricts network access, supporting UNIX, IPv4, IPv6, Netlink, and KCAPI sockets, along with application firewalls and IP blocklists.</li>\n<li><strong>Advanced Features</strong>: Includes lock sandboxing using Landlock LSM, proxy sandboxing with network namespace isolation (defaulting to TOR), memory and PID sandboxing as simpler alternatives to control groups, SafeSetID for secure UID/GID transitions, and Ghost mode for enhanced process isolation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I will also discuss how Syd addresses common security challenges such as TOCTOU issues and side-channel attacks, aligning with a threat model similar to that of seccomp. Attendees will gain insights into the design and implementation of Syd, its practical applications in enhancing system security, and how it can be integrated into various environments -- including as a login shell -- to provide robust application isolation.</p>",

In particular, I'll explain how sq aims to firstly be a\ntool for end users, and not developers writing scripts, and what that\nmeans for users of the tool.  I'll then present how sq is different\nfrom other tools in the ecosystem.  In this regard, one of the most\nimportant differences is that sq explicitly does not support curated\nkeyrings; users have to authenticate all of the certificates that they\nuse.  At first blush, this may sound like a usability nightmare, but\nI'll show how sq supports users by managing evidence, which simplifies\nthese decisions.  Finally, I'll demonstrate several workflows.  These\ninclude how to verify files, how to create and manage a certificate,\nhow to find a certificate and use it, and how to create and manage a\nCA for your organization.</p>",

The agent has support for RSA and ECDSA keys, while also having additional features like host keys, proxy support for additional agents, wrapping of existing keys and import of remotely created keys.</p>\n<p>In this talk we will take a look at how the agent works, how the TPM is capable of preventing key extraction, and the other features available in the agent.</p>",

These solutions often emphasize protection against sophisticated adversaries, zero-day exploits, and malicious insiders. However, our real-world experience reveals that the majority of initial compromises occur through simpler approaches, such as stolen credentials and phishing attacks.</p>\n<p>In this talk, we introduce Buffalogs, an open-source solution designed to detect and alert on anomalous login behaviors. Adhering to the Unix philosophy of \"do one thing and do it well,\" Buffalogs offers a way to analyze common application logs (ssh, Apache, Microsoft Entra ID, etc) and detect credential misuse. Attendees will gain insights into the challenges of login anomaly detection, the development of Buffalogs and the differences between our solution and other commercial alternatives.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>What was the last npm package you installed?  Did anything unexpected happen?  Are you sure?</p>\n<p>The scale and pace of modern software development are made possible by the ready availability of open-source packages via major registries like npm and PyPI.  These registries are always within reach of developers thanks to command-line package managers like npm and pip, enabling rapid testing and deployment of third-party code as part of normal workflows.  However, these benefits come at the cost of particular security concerns: threat actors routinely target software developers via open-source package registries, either by publishing backdoored packages or by taking over and corrupting legitimate software. In many such supply-chain attacks, merely installing the malicious package is enough to hand control of one’s system over to the adversary.</p>\n<p>In this talk, we lay out the strategies that threat actors use when targeting software developers via open-source package registries.  We do so by examining case-studies in open-source malware delivery via npm and PyPI, some involving nation-state actors, that we at Datadog Security Research have collected while continuously monitoring these ecosystems with GuardDog, an open-source scanner for identifying malicious packages by analyzing code patterns and package metadata.  We then propose recommendations for developers, as well as for the package registries themselves, to counter these strategies that could lead to a greater overall level of software supply-chain security in the open-source community.</p>",

Our specification combines an operational specification for unprivileged user code with a separation logic specification of privileged state and operations. The specification precisely captures the subtle behaviors of NOVA such as address translation and user faults. Separation logic’s small footprint and open world nature  makes the specification highly modular and reasonably high level, allowing us to abstract architectural details that are encapsulated by NOVA and evolve the formal specification as NOVA evolves. Using the specification, we have carried out proofs of the NOVA source code as well as of applications running on top of NOVA.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>One of the most idiosyncratic parts of POSIX compliance is signal support. On microkernels the implementation can prove to be quite difficult. One especially tricky part is the cancellation of POSIX syscalls when they are interrupted by signals, and the intricacies of EINTR side effects. Monolithic kernels inheritely have the bookkeeping required to implement this without  extra overhead. In contrast, due to the generally distributed nature of microkernels, properly cancelling syscalls requires extra work. This is especially the case for Managarm, where (1) POSIX is implemented in a userspace server, (2) syscalls are asynchronous and (3) can involve multiple servers.</p>\n<p>In this talk, we will explore the process of implementing syscall cancellation on Managarm. A brief overview of signal delivery is given, followed by a deep dive into the new lifetime of a Managarm POSIX request. Finally, we give a summary of the lessons learned while implementing cancellation in a fully asynchronous microkernel.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Neo4j had its first stable release in 2010 and soon became one of the defining NoSQL systems, establishing \"graph databases\" as a new category. These systems represent data as nodes and edges, allowing for intuitive querying and visualization, as well as performance benefits on certain types of queries (e.g. path finding).</p>\n<p>In this talk, I give a brief overview of the past, present, and future of graph databases. I first summarize the history of graph database systems, focusing on their main categories and use cases. Then, I discuss the key challenges that continue to hinder the adoption of graph databases, including a fragmented landscape and performance limitations.</p>\n<p>I end the talk with recent positive developments: (1) Advances in standardization that led to the ISO GQL and SQL/PGQ languages, (2) Performance increases driven by competition on the LDBC benchmark suite, (3) A new generation of open-source graph database systems such as Kùzu and DuckPGQ, (4) Opportunities in machine learning use cases such as GraphRAG.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>With rise in organizations adopting the open data lakehouse architecture, the ecosystem continues to evolve rapidly. Even as industry vendors attempt to standardize around a replacement for good-old Hive, users continue to choose specific table formats such as Apache Hudi, Iceberg, or Delta Lake, for their strengths around specific workloads. New open table formats and columnar file formats optimized for streaming or unstructured data all continue to emerge and recently a crop of new open-source data catalogs have also been gaining mindshare.</p>\n<p>These developments underscore the need an interoperability standard for the open data lakehouse, to ensure all the pieces fit with each other without any lockin to any one format, catalog or compute engine. Apache XTable, an open-source project currently incubating under the Apache Software Foundation, addresses this challenge by enabling interoperability across table formats without the need to rewrite any data files, ensuring that each format’s benefits remain accessible within a unified lakehouse setup.</p>\n<p>This talk will go over XTable's architecture and its capabilities, designed to support omnidirectional translation between open table formats. By utilizing shared metadata information, XTable enables continuous metadata translation across these formats, allowing data to be accessed by various compute engines and workflows without duplication or extensive rewrites. Unlike one-off conversions, XTable’s continuous metadata updates enable seamless translation of new commits incrementally, which can be beneficial at scale. Moving up a layer, we will then show how to synchronize XTable across multiple open-source and proprietary data catalogs to manage permissions and access control policies. This finally makes it easy for users to bring the best-of-breed compute engines to their data easily. </p>\n<p>Finally, we’ll present lessons learned and updates from the community on various deployment options for XTable for example using Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow (MWAA) and AWS Lambda, or how Microsoft Fabric and Snowflake are pursuing interoperability with XTable.</p>\n<p>project: https://github.com/apache/incubator-xtable</p>",

While it excelled in time-based queries, we found that certain generic analytical queries were slower than expected. In this session, we’ll walk through how we identified opportunities for improvement, the key changes we implemented, and how those changes delivered dramatic performance improvements in a relatively short timeframe.</p>\n<p>We’ll demonstrate before-and-after queries to showcase the impact of these optimisations.

    "abstract": "<p>Open source is more than just code—it is a philosophy, a movement, and a framework that touches every aspect of society. However, as open source grows, there is a risk of it becoming another siloed institution, disconnected from the very communities it seeks to serve, much like academia and corporate America. To ensure open source remains inclusive and impactful, we must actively involve local communities in the process of technological development.  </p>\n<p>This talk explores how regional OSPO (Open Source Program Office) networks can serve as catalysts for inclusive innovation by connecting local communities, tech meetups, academic institutions, and civic organizations. These networks create a framework to:<br />\n- Study problems affecting local communities.<br />\n- Develop open technologies tailored to address these issues.<br />\n- Implement solutions through open governance, ensuring transparency, equity, and sustainability.  </p>\n<p>By dedicating resources to both regional collaboration and local focus, regional OSPO networks strike a balance that drives large-scale innovation while staying grounded in the needs of diverse communities.  </p>\n<p>Key themes include:<br />\n- <strong>Open Source as a Societal Institution:</strong> Why open source must go beyond code and actively integrate with local communities to avoid becoming siloed.<br />\n- <strong>Regional Networks for Connection:</strong> How regional OSPO networks foster collaboration among civic institutions, academia, local communities, and the tech industry.<br />\n- <strong>Inclusive Technology Development:</strong> How to engage local voices to study problems, co-develop solutions, and ensure equitable implementation.<br />\n- <strong>The 20/80 Framework:</strong> A practical model for balancing local focus with regional collaboration to create resilient and impactful networks.  </p>\n<p>This session offers a vision for a new kind of open source ecosystem—one that connects society’s diverse sectors, tackles real-world problems, and builds a foundation for sustainable, community-driven innovation. Whether you’re a community leader, OSPO practitioner, or open source advocate, join us to explore how we can bridge the gap between open source ideals and societal impact.  </p>\n<p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong><br />\n- The importance of integrating local communities into open source development processes.<br />\n- How regional OSPO networks can address local challenges through collaborative innovation.<br />\n- Strategies for fostering open governance and inclusive technology development.  </p>\n<p>This talk is a call to action: let’s ensure open source remains a force for collective good, bringing all of society into the fold. Together, we can prevent open source from becoming another siloed institution and instead position it as a true bridge to a better future.</p>",

You’ll learn how this bias skews community perceptions, perpetuates systemic challenges, and limits opportunities.</p>\n<p>By examining barriers like unwelcoming dynamics, recruitment biases, and a lack of mentorship, you'll understand why many are deterred before or during their FOSS journeys. You'll also learn how survivorship bias interacts with intersectionality, compounding challenges for women of color, LGBTQ+ individuals, and others.</p>\n<p>We’ll also explore examples of communities and initiatives that successfully counter these trends, demonstrating allyship's role in building equitable environments. Finally, drawing on research and real-world examples, we’ll propose actionable steps to create a more inclusive and welcoming FOSS landscape for all.</p>\n<p>Whether you’re a contributor, maintainer, or community leader, this session will give you a deeper understanding of the problem and tangible ways to drive change in your circles.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Hello, my name is David Berman. I am an electrician by trade, not a programmer by profession, but I have ventured into the world of programming out of necessity and conviction. My journey into this realm has been fueled by a desire to challenge the prevailing norms of an industry heavily skewed toward proprietary, enterprise-oriented solutions. Specifically, I have worked to advocate for open-source, cost-effective methods to control city streetlights and other industrial control systems traditionally dominated by expensive and exclusive technologies.</p>\n<p>During my talk I would like to share my newest project, Gungnir:\nhttps://github.com/davidjrb/gungnir</p>\n<p>This journey has been far from easy. The resistance to change in this space is significant, and the challenges are both technical and cultural. One of the key barriers is the entrenched power of profit-driven opponents, including corporate lobbyists and those with vested interests in maintaining the status quo. These forces often stifle innovation and prevent the adoption of solutions that could benefit society as a whole by reducing costs and fostering collaboration.</p>\n<p>Another challenge comes from within the very community I advocate for. Despite the immense potential of open-source solutions, there is a tendency among many non-programmers—particularly those in traditional trades or management roles—to dismiss these solutions out of hand. This is often due to a lack of familiarity with the technology or misconceptions about its reliability and scalability. Bridging this gap requires not only technical expertise but also the ability to communicate the value and viability of open-source approaches in terms that resonate with a broader audience.</p>\n<p>In my talk, I aim to explore these challenges in depth, sharing insights from my own experience as a non-programmer navigating a highly technical field. I will discuss the hurdles faced by the open-source community when advocating for transparency, collaboration, and cost-efficiency in an industry often resistant to such ideals. I will also highlight strategies to foster greater acceptance and collaboration between open-source advocates and those unfamiliar with or skeptical of these technologies.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, my goal is to spark a dialogue about how we, as a community, can better advocate for open-source solutions in industrial and civic systems, ensuring that they are not only adopted but also embraced as a viable and beneficial alternative to proprietary models. By sharing stories, challenges, and strategies, I hope to inspire others—whether programmers, non-programmers, or industry professionals—to join this important movement.</p>\n<p>Thank you for considering my submission, and I look forward to contributing to this vital conversation.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Since 2022, the <a href=\"https://ocf.tw/en/\">Open Culture Foundation (OCF)</a> has been collaborating with <a href=\"https://moda.gov.tw/en/\">Taiwan’s Ministry of Digital Affairs (MoDA)</a> and <a href=\"https://www.steps.com.tw\">STEPS (a local tech company)</a> on government-funded localization projects. These initiatives aim to make civic tech and open-source tools more accessible in Taiwan while enabling international projects to take root and thrive locally.</p>\n<p>As a coordinator, OCF has completely localized projects such as GOV.UK Notify, GOV.UK Forms, Matrix Client (Element Series), IRMA, Yivi, Standard for Public Code, Bitwarden, Nextcloud, FreeOTP, GIMP, and Mattermost. Some of these projects have been contributed back to their upstream repositories, while others have evolved into localized solutions tailored to Taiwan's needs. OCF’s efforts focus on three key areas to ensure government funding provides not only financial support but also a foundation for sustainable development.</p>\n<p><strong>This talk will explore these three main focus areas:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Optimizing the Government Perspective on Open Source</strong>\n    Educating government officials about the nature of open-source communities, their collaboration models, and the unique attributes of various international open-source projects. OCF also developed a collaborative glossary process to bridge communication gaps among stakeholders and ensure consistent terminology usage.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Collaboration Among Taiwan’s Communities</strong>\n    Partnering with Taiwan’s L10N community, OCF established structured review processes to meet the government’s high standards for quality and timeliness. Over three years, OCF conducted two major surveys during COSCUP. One survey identified critical open-source projects needed in Taiwan, while the other focused on addressing challenges that hinder contributions, aiming to encourage broader participation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Engagement with Local Industry and International Communities</strong>\n    Although Taiwanese tech teams are highly skilled, many are unfamiliar with the culture of open-source contributions. OCF facilitated understanding of licensing, contribution practices, and engagement with upstream communities. For example, OCF helped Mattermost report and resolve a date display bug in Chinese (CJK) scripts and worked with upstream communities to address significant differences between Simplified and Traditional Chinese, including grammar and linguistic nuances.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Localization is not merely about technical translation; it is a strategic approach to connecting governments, communities, and international open-source projects. This talk will share OCF’s experiences in bridging these gaps and invite Community DevRoom participants to exchange ideas on how to effectively integrate open-source projects into their respective countries.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>In today's world, where disability affects a significant percentage of the population, it is crucial for open-source communities to address the challenges faced by persons with disabilities (PWDs) and work towards their inclusion. This talk will delve into practical measures such as referral programs, internal disability disclosures, and integrating disability into existing agendas rather than treating it as a separate issue. We will dive into disability mainstreaming with a focus on its role in promoting universal design and inclusivity. Attendees will gain insights into establishing disability mainstreaming committees, formulating action plans, implementing best practices, and monitoring and evaluating progress.</p>",

This talk explores the nuanced and evolving role of LLMs in fostering community engagement. Specialized companies offer tailoring of LLM and automation of responses to technical questions. We will explore a range of adoption options from cautious, opt-in approaches confined to specific channels to fully embracing LLMs for first-line support across forums. These strategies raise questions like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Could automation stifle organic, person-to-person connections in communities, or can it expedite learning and enable meaningful contributions from newcomers?</li>\n<li>How do LLMs reshape the balance between in-person and digital interactions, and what does this mean for the future of community building?</li>\n<li>Are LLMs the natural evolution of IRC-era bots, or will they alter the patterns of open source collaboration?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We’ll look at case studies from real communities. Attendees will get actionable insights for navigating the adoption of LLMs in their own communities, striking a balance between automation and authentic human connection.</p>",

Do you blindly copy and paste the governance of other projects hoping it works for your project too? Do you struggle to keep governance up to date or aligned with what’s actually going on in the project? You’re not alone.</p>\n<p>Secondly, we want to provide a simple, practical, and proven approach to writing governance that’s directly inspired from coding best practices. The very same concepts that are used when writing code (e.g. Don’t Repeat Yourself, Keep It Simple, or Separation of Concerns) have direct application when authoring governance documents and create the same kind of positive outcomes: governance that is simple to understand, flexible, and and easy to maintain. You’ll never come back from thinking about governance as code.</p>\n<p>By the time you leave this presentation, you’ll have an entirely new perspective on governance and will feel empowered by your ability to leverage your existing software engineering skills in this new domain.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Digital Public Goods are often celebrated as open-source software, open data, open AI models, open standards, and open content. However, true public goods require more than openness—they demand active community governance, collective stewardship, and responsible contributions to thrive as shared resources.</p>\n<p>While proprietary software sustains itself through licensing, support, and vendor lock-in, open-source software relies on a delicate balance of professional firms, organizational backing, and dedicated enthusiasts. The open model has fueled flexibility, innovation, and the global adoption of open technologies.</p>\n<p>Yet, the rapid growth of \"open\" has not been matched by an equivalent rise in contributions or investments in maintenance. Discussions often prioritize licensing over the essential question: How do we, as a community, ensure that digital public goods are sustainable? This talk explores the responsibility of contributors, organizations, and users in building a resilient ecosystem for open technologies.</p>",

This is surprising since most of these practices are language-agnostic.</p>\n<p>This is a significant gap, especially given GC's impact on application performance.

So how to happily marry an old-school Network Manager and brand new Kubernetes API?</p>\n<p>Over the years we were working on the NMstate project to provide you with a Declarative Network API, allowing you to manage host networking in a declarative manner.</p>\n<p>In 2025 we are coming back with brand new features. Based on the feedback, we focused on air-gapped and big clusters – think hundreds of nodes with hundreds of VLANs each. We also happily married K8s and KubeVirt – no matter what your workload is, containers or VMs, NMstate is there for you.</p>\n<p>Not only a project update – we will also show you how the Kubernetes cluster with NMState Operator manages networking on the nodes it deploys. It may sound like a chicken and egg situation, but trust us, it is not. Last but not least, we show how it protects itself from applying destructive network changes potentially taking your cluster down.</p>\n<p>Join us and discover what’s new in the world of complex network topologies.</p>",

These include substantial overhead, resulting in larger, less efficient deployments and startup times, and a dependency on the underlying OS for security, posing potential vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p>WebAssembly (Wasm) addresses these challenges, and this talk will introduce the open-source project Boxer (https://boxer.dev), which offers tooling for taking existing containerized workloads and definitions, and creating near-universally deployable Wasm distributions (“Boxes”) offering roughly the same environment, with all the benefits of the WebAssembly target. Wasm, a compact binary instruction format, enables lightweight, sandboxed execution, significantly reducing overhead compared to traditional containers. This leads to enhanced performance and smaller, more efficient deployments, ideal for cloud computing. Additionally, Wasm's memory-safe, isolated execution environment provides superior security, independent of the OS. Thus, Wasm, with its blend of efficiency and security, emerges as not just an alternative, but a substantial improvement over container technology for cloud deployments.</p>\n<p>Marcotte (https://github.com/dphilla/marcotte) -- the underlying tool for virtualizing layers of system functionality -- allows us to make safe, sandboxed, discrete, and composable system functionality, by leveraging Rust's memory safety model, and the inherent properties of WebAssembly.</p>\n<p>This talk will critically examine this new technology, its approach, benefits, and existing limitations compared with containers, and its path forward as a new standard in cloud infrastructure.</p>",

However, their security limitations, particularly from shared kernel access, have led to a renewed interest in traditional VMs for stronger isolation. Technologies like kata-containers enhance security by running containers inside microVMs, offering better isolation, but they introduce complexity and overhead. Specifically, the container runtimes spawn additional processes to manage the container within the VM, adding extra layers of complexity and resource consumption.</p>\n<p>This talk examines the pros and cons of sandboxed container runtimes, focusing on the added complexity of auxiliary processes. It then proposes a more efficient and streamlined approach based on the unikernel paradigm, where only the application and its dependencies are running. Rather than using strict unikernels, it explores how containers can run inside specialized, stripped-down Linux VMs, containing only the components required by the application and without additional services. This is achieved through urunc, a CRI-compatible container runtime that treats unikernels like standard containers, managing the user application via the VM process.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Container images sometimes take tens to hundreds of megabytes in size and require many network resources to be transferred.\nEspecially in low-bandwidth network environments like edge computing, frequent image updating will be difficult and increase the network cost.\nIn this talk, I will present \"D4C\", a software that provides faster and lighter image updating with delta encodings.\nDelta encodings reduce data size, but generating and applying deltas is a time-consuming operation.\nD4C utilizes some techniques to reduce them including merge-based delta management and applying deltas lazily.\nD4C reduces the data size to update images by up to 95% and provides about 10x faster updating in low-bandwidth networks than the state-of-the-art approach.\nBenchmarks with PostgreSQL and PyTorch showed that their performance degradation caused by D4C is negligible.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>TuxBake is a framework designed to simplify the creation and management sets of containers, focusing on automation, scalability, and flexibility. Unlike Packer, which excels at building single \"golden images\" for immutable infrastructure, TuxBake is tailored for environments requiring multiple lightweight, highly-configured images, such as GEICO's. It automates dependency updates by dynamically fetching and locking versions from container repositories, reducing manual effort and ensuring consistency. With its centralized configuration management and integration with CI/CD pipelines, TuxBake streamlines complex workflows, automates testing, and publishes validated images efficiently.</p>\n<p>TuxBake addresses use cases requiring dynamic updates and multiple image variations without duplicated build logic. Its ability to manage dependencies dynamically, scale configurations efficiently, and integrate seamlessly with DevOps ecosystems makes it ideal for modern, fast-paced environments. </p>\n<p>We will present a demo of TuxBake, which is currently being used by us to solve our engineering needs. We will focus on its ability to simplify multi-image builds, automate dependency management, and integrate seamlessly with existing workflows. We would like to receive feedback from the community regarding its future iterations, ensuring TuxBake remains a valuable tool for evolving infrastructure needs.</p>",

Java Flight Recorder (JFR) reduces this bias but introduces interpolation errors.</p>\n<p>This talk addresses these challenges with three key topics:\n• Combining precise sampling with JFR’s stability to remove biases without sacrificing reliability.\n• Using eBPF probes and examining JVM internals for safer, detailed profiling.\n• Enhancing precision with user-supplied profiling contexts.</p>\n<p>We will review the history of Java profilers and discuss the future of JVM profiling, with a focus on CPU profiling. Attendees will gain insights into new methods aimed at achieving accurate, stable performance analysis in Java applications, comparing them with async-profiler and existing tools.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Java code that is ahead-of-time (AOT) compiled using GraalVM Community Edition native-image may run more slowly than code that is just-in-time (JIT) compiled with the HotSpot compiler. This is something I quickly discovered when I joined the GraalVM team at Red Hat. </p>\n<p>Diagnosing performance issues in Java code can be done using Java Microbenchmark Harness (JMH), which helps developers build, run and analyse microbenchmarks written in Java. However, it only works with Java virtual machines using JIT compilation. For the past four years I’ve been wondering how to make JMH achieve the same objectives when that Java code runs as GraalVM native executables.</p>\n<p>Eventually I solved this problem creating an extension to JMH that allows Java developers to seamlessly run their existing JMH benchmarks as GraalVM native executables. In this talk I will demonstrate how to obtain benchmark results, gather performance statistics and inspect annotated assembly code. Finally I will compare how the GraalVM native-image AOT code differs from the JIT code of HotSpot.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>GraalVM Native Image is a popular tool for building standalone executables from Java applications. It is able to generate executables with fast startup time and low memory footprint through the use of a closed world assumption, constraints on dynamism, and many traditional compiler optimizations.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Native Image's many advanced features can make its build process inscrutable to an inexperienced developer. It is hard to decipher how its many internal components (e.g. analysis, compiler phases, plugins, intrinsics, features, singletons, substitutions, etc.) work in concert and what assumptions must not be violated.</p>\n<p>In this talk I will attempt to help make sense of the Native Image build process. I will first describe what components exist and how they interact with each other. Next, I will walk through a native image build and highlight key phases of the process. Finally, I will provide some practical tips to follow when trying to learn more about specific functionality within Native Image.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Modern embedded and autonomous systems are pushing the boundaries of software complexity, especially in critical applications. Traditional testing methods often struggle to meet the demands of these systems, particularly when operating on resource-sharing architectures running complex operating systems like Linux. To address this challenge, we introduce Statistical Path Coverage (SPC), a novel statistical approach designed to enhance test effectiveness by statistically focusing on the execution paths exercised by target applications.</p>\n<p>This presentation will discuss how SPC can quantify execution path coverage, estimate the risk of untested paths, and support assurance. We will also introduce DB4SIL, a tool leveraging FTrace to collect and analyze execution traces, enabling actionable insights into the kernel’s behavior during testing campaigns. Through examples, we will demonstrate how SPC and DB4SIL can guide developers in prioritizing testing efforts, improving test coverage, enabling continuous monitoring, and reducing risk in complex, software-driven systems.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Many of the international standards for software in critical systems (e.g. IEC 61508, ISO 26262) are published under restrictive licences, at high prices. They broadly discourage the use of FOSS, by imposition of processes that do not align with modern open source best practices such as continuous delivery and automated testing. As a result some industries such as automotive, medical and aerospace, are locked in to proprietary software.</p>\n<p>This talk will introduce the Trustable Software Framework (TSF), a new free and open source project which establishes an evidence-based method for measuring the actual risks involved in continuous delivery of software in critical systems.</p>\n<p>TSF is applicable over the entire software supply chain, including CICD tools and infrastructure, build dependencies, operating systems, target applications and test environments, and is intended to measure risk on projects delivering critical systems which demand reliability, availability, security and safety.</p>",

Prevent them from being scheduled onto the CPU? And the best part: Without the application being able to prevent this, like it could do with POSIX STOP and START signals?\nIn come the scheduler extensions for the Linux Kernel. Introduced in version 6.12, they allow you to quickly write your own schedulers with eBPF, and can be the base for simple libraries that enable you to start and stop threads directly in the Linux kernel. This opens the possibility of creating complex scheduler scenarios at a whim.</p>\n<p>In this talk, we'll show you a prototypical sched_ext-based library for concurrency testing that we used to reproduce bugs when working on the OpenJDK.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>At DigitalOcean's internal platform team, we use a tool called <code>docc</code> to make deploying apps easier for our teams. It’s designed to hide the complexity of <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/\">Kubernetes</a> so teams can focus on getting their apps running without needing to understand Kubernetes itself.</p>\n<p>When we deploy updates to applications, we usually use a simple method where old versions are replaced with new ones, one by one, over a short time. This works fine most of the time, but if the new version has bugs—causing slower performance or errors for users—this method doesn’t have a built-in way to catch those problems early or quickly switch back to the previous version.</p>\n<p>To solve this, we’ve added safer deployment strategies like <em>canary</em> and <em>A/B testing</em>. These allow us to release updates more cautiously by directing only a small percentage of user traffic to the new version first. If everything looks good, we slowly increase the traffic. If not, we can automatically roll back quickly.</p>\n<p>We achieved this by using tools like the <a href=\"https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/\">Kubernetes Gateway API</a>, <a href=\"https://www.envoyproxy.io/\">Envoy proxy</a>, and <a href=\"https://istio.io/\">Istio</a> to manage and control how traffic flows between different versions of an app. These tools work together to create a \"service mesh,\" which helps us balance traffic and make deployment smoother and safer.</p>\n<p>In this talk, we’ll share what we learned while setting this up and how it’s helping us ensure more reliable application updates at DigitalOcean.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>As with many stages of the software development lifecycle, the release process needs to be constantly improved, iteration by iteration. This way, the software product gets delivered faster and more reliably to customers. This paper focuses on different techniques that have shortened the release cycle of the Kuiper Linux distribution. \nThe new release process involves creating a stabilization branch from main which is dedicated to the new release.  Previously, the software components were built and installed during the image creation. Now they are released independently as Debian packages which are uploaded on Analog Devices' Linux Package Repository. This is an easy, user-friendly method that facilitates the distribution and installation of ADI software packages. Each software component has its own release cycle so that one component's bugs won't affect the other components' release. \nThe software components are tested both separately and integrated into the Kuiper image. The latter required creating a Kuiper Docker image. This ensures that each software component is compatible with the target system as early as possible in the development process.</p>",

It is the very first success criteria in WCAG - SC 1.1.1: Non-text Content (Level A). It is so simple, yet it isn't. Despite all the guidance, including presentations like this one, folks get it wrong, over and over again. A lot can be done through using approaches like those recommended in the Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) 2.0. Clearly, authors need support. </p>\n<p>This presentation will cover a bit of this theory, but also highlight a simple Python script that I wrote to crawl a website so that we can more easily examine the alternative text that is provided. I'll quickly walk through the script, and then look at some of the more entertaining alt-text which is sitting on public government websites. </p>\n<p>It is worth noting that there is no automated tool that presently does much more than check that there is alt-text on an image. This clearly isn't sufficient to determining if the meaning of the image is represented in that alt text.</p>",

Most liquidsoap streams need to be produced in real-time and can dynamically switch from one stream to the next.</p>\n<p>This results in added complexity with regard to stream description: how to make sure that abstract content is generated in real-time (e.g. 2s of content is generated in 2s, slowing down the application if needed), how to maintain DTS/PTS consistency when switching from one stream to the next, etc.</p>\n<p>In this talk, we will present the challenges and solutions that are currently implemented in liquidsoap and explain the kind of abstract content API we hope to see emerging in the future to support the next generation of media streaming application.</p>",

I'll present my typical workflow, and the different pieces of software I used to make it possible for me to write purely classical music (symphonic poems), but also orchestral arrangements for songs in different genres (e.g., folk, progressive rock or metal) that I published as a hobby in my free time over the years.</p>\n<p>Again, a clickbait title because I'm not really an orchestra composer... but FOSS definitely helped make me feel like one, and it can help you too!</p>",

The alternatives would be to either fork libsrt (or hope to upstream some pretty drastic changes) or build an entire alternative library from scratch... Or is a there a secret third option..?

    "abstract": "<p>In 2024, we presented our open-source project that opens browser support to a variety of formats. This project introduces a new HTML5 syntax designed to create dynamic media pipelines for use cases related to media content handling. It leverages several technologies, including WebAssembly, Emscripten, Web Components, and GPAC. Together, these tools enable dynamic support for data formats not natively supported by browsers. This enables the option of display of data in legacy formats and promotes the development of new formats without relying on browsers to supply native support and without relying on generation and maintenance of browser plugins. </p>\n<p>The proposed HTML5 syntax is intuitive and flexible, catering both to novice web designers and professional developers within the open-source community who want to ensure that media content is accessible across all browsers. However, creating new decoders and integrating into the underlying GPAC media filter framework can be challenging for developers unfamiliar with WebAssembly and GPAC’s framework. </p>\n<p>To address this, alongside the player and SDK, we have updated our Visual Studio Code extension to streamline the development and integration of custom media decoders. The extension is now fully integrated with GitHub repositories, enabling users to retrieve, modify, compile, and test WebAssembly decoders directly. Additionally, we have released a new set of license-free decoders covering various use cases, including documents, images, audio, and video.</p>\n<p>Our visual studio code extension is available at the following URL :\nhttps://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Bevara.bevara-access</p>\n<p>This project is open to contributions. Below are the links to our repositories:\n•   Filters Repository: Contains all license-free media filters that can be integrated “as is“ into web pages or modified.\n•   Solver Repository: The fundamental glue component that enables the dynamic building of media filters within web pages.\n•   Player Repository: Provides the SDK and tools for compiling media filters locally.</p>\n<p>By encouraging the use of public forks on open projects—which require making derived projects public—we aim to foster a growing repository of freely available decoders for the community to use and build upon.</p>",

Instead of just calling for more funding for open source, public digital infrastructure, digital commons, etc, the talk will concretely compare proposed funding approaches, discuss the practicalities of an institution like the EU investing in FOSS maintenance and security, and examine how the funding might be delivered in the next Multiannual Financial Framework.</p>\n<p>The second part of the talk will highlight the opportunity for a Sovereign Tech Agency at the EU level which plays a greater role in funding the maintenance and security of FOSS. The German government's support to build the Sovereign Tech Fund, now the Sovereign Tech Agency, has received a lot of attention in Europe and globally for its ability to support and invest in the FOSS ecosystem. This talk will present an initial legal analysis for what an EU-scale Sovereign Tech Fund could look like, in consideration of three different potential institutional set-ups: (2) one EU funding body to rule them all, (2) a federated set up with a coordinating body/system, and (3) a free for all for all Member States to set up their own funding bodies. It will then consider the next steps for developing a more comprehensive feasibility assessment of this topic and making the case for FOSS funding to policymakers in the European Commission.</p>",

We’ll then take a close look at the fundraising truism that it’s all about making “the right ask to the right person at the right time” and how to apply this in your fundraising. Storytelling is the key to setting up the “right ask.” Networking is the key to getting to the “right person.” And events (from networking at conferences to hosting a reception) are one strategy for creating “the right time.”</p>",

Not only should funding models support the fundamental goals of the project, but developers should also recognize that there are times when funding opportunities are not in their long term interests. We'll explore specific examples of circumstances where accepting funding from particular sources would compromise the project's brand or values, and when the expectations of the funder don't exactly match the developer's plans, leading to strained relationships going forward.  These issues touch on a variety of topics including project governance, brand management, community management and ethics, in addition to fundraising strategies for long term donor relationships.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>More money for Free and Open Source Software - a never ending issue. In a tech world built on start-ups, venture capital and data-gathering apps, the fight for sustainable funding for ethical technology projects is a fierce one. After some big victories for FOSS funding in the last years, this talk is about the importance of not forgetting the small, underdog civil society projects.</p>\n<p>How do we fund technology in a sustainable way? Fund infrastructure, fund maintenance, fund that project some random person in Nebraska has been thanklessly maintaining since 2003. While infrastructure is extremely important (no questions asked), in this talk we want to explore why a diverse funding landscape that also allows for supporting new people and groups with fresh ideas can only be incredibly valuable to the field of FOSS.</p>\n<p>How can we use existing funding structures, bend and twist them to meet the real needs of communities? How can we make them more useful to projects and people who are not typically the recipients of their money? We want to talk about how to build support infrastructure that allows us to fund in ways that bring more diversity, more novel ideas and more inclusivity to our communities - and we want to talk about how to do this in a sustainable way. </p>\n<p>The background to this talk is our experience in managing the German FOSS Prototype Fund, which has funded nearly 400 projects over the past eight years together with the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research. Following an extensive internal and external evaluation, and as the initial funding was coming to an end, we spent the last year designing and setting up a new, more sustainable funding structure for early-stage projects. </p>\n<p>This talk is a call to government institutions, funders and other organisations with the power to distribute money to join forces, break down the barriers of their traditional funding models and create a broad and vibrant network of small, diverse and lightweight funds that meet the needs of different groups and communities. It is an invitation to communities to come together and share their needs in order to help build structures that can actually support their work. There is hope in FOSS projects, old and new, big and small. Let's hack all kinds of systems to give them the support they need.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Intel provided a reference protocol for embedding Intel SGX attestation in the X.509 certificate to establish a TLS-based trusted channel named RA-TLS. This protocol does not use the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) architecture of the X.509 certificate; instead, it relies solely on attestation quote verification to verify the binding between X.509 certificate to the Intel SGX root-of-trust. It may not always be desirable, as quote verification is relatively more expensive compared to certificate chain verification with PKI in place. Moreover, Intel reference implementation for DCAP requires additional infrastructure, including Provisioning Certificate Caching Services (PCCS), which the Intel DCAP reference implementation is tightly coupled with. </p>\n<p>In this talk, we present TC4SE, previously published in the Information Security Conference 2023, which proposed a mechanism to bind SGX root-of-trust primitives with PKI root-of-trust to establish trusted channel. We also present some alternative mechanisms to eliminate the dependency on the web-based PCCS server when developing an Intel SGX application that requires quote generation and verification.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Trusted Execution Environments in combination with open-source and reproducible code provide transparency by relying on reviewers to analyze the Trusted Computing Base (TCB). And the size of the TCB directly influences the speed at which new releases and bug fixes are deployed to production, since reviews take a lot of time. So low-TCB environments are a desired solution that many teams try to achieve.\nBut even the main security features needed to implement a trusted workload, such as end-to-end encryption, require significant increases in the TCB. For example, more general approaches like TLS with an extensive feature set including support for many signature schemes, certificate parsing and session resumption logic may be less ideal for low-TCB environments.\nTo address this issue we will present a remote attestation scheme that uses Noise Protocol Framework to create an end-to-end encrypted attested channel between an end-user device and a TEE. Noise Protocol Framework allows us to minimize the amount of crypto primitives needed and only leave the logic that is necessary to establish an encrypted session and to bind it to the attestation evidence.\nDuring this talk we will also present an open-source implementation of our approach written in Rust.</p>",

H-hat is a high-level abstraction quantum programming language designed to close the gap between software development and quantum resources, by using familiar programming concepts in a hybrid paradigm. Its quantum type system introduces quantum types that can hold both classical and quantum types, define the number of indexes (qubits) that a quantum variable is able to use, as well as define the rules in which a quantum type can be cast into a classical type. The casting process causes the quantum variable to execute its context at runtime, compile the quantum instructions to be executed and measured in a quantum simulator or hardware, and provide the appropriate conversion method from bits sampling to the desired classical type.</p>",

In this talk we’ll discuss how Apache Mahout’s Samsara project introduced the idea of avoiding vendor lock-in by allowing machine learning experts to author algorithms in a vendor-neutral language that would then run everywhere. This spirit is living on in the Qumat project which allows user to write quantum circuits and algorithms (in a vendor-neutral Python library), which are then transpiled to run on IBM’s qiskit, Google cirq, Amazon Braket, or to extend the library to run on other hardware.</p>",

Supported by pytket, the library is compatible with the Quantinuum ion-trap backend, enabling the construction of verifiable MBQC patterns compatible with near-term noisy quantum hardware. Building on the principles of quantum verification, ocvqc-py implements a novel approach to on-chip verification, allowing users to generate verifiable MBQC patterns without the need for quantum communication between client and server, which is typical in traditional verifiable MBQC setups. ocvqc-py has been used to construct measurement patterns with up to 52 vertices, demonstrated on the Quantinuum H1-1 ion-trap quantum computer, which is the largest verified MBQC pattern implemented to date.</p>\n<p>The full paper can be found here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24133\nThe code: https://github.com/CQCL/ocvqc-py</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>While containers have been pivotal in cloud computing, offering isolated environments for applications, they bring notable drawbacks. These include substantial overhead, resulting in larger, less efficient deployments and startup times, and a dependency on the underlying OS for security, posing potential vulnerabilities. </p>\n<p>WebAssembly (Wasm) addresses these challenges, and this talk will introduce the open-source project Boxer (https://boxer.dev), which offers tooling for taking existing containerized workloads and definitions, and creating near-universally deployable Wasm distributions (“Boxes”) offering roughly the same environment, with all the benefits of the WebAssembly target. Wasm, a compact binary instruction format, enables lightweight, sandboxed execution,  significantly reducing overhead compared to traditional containers. This leads to enhanced performance and smaller, more efficient deployments, ideal for cloud computing. Additionally, Wasm's memory-safe, isolated execution environment provides superior security, independent of the OS. Thus, Wasm, with its blend of efficiency and security, emerges as not just an alternative, but a substantial improvement over container technology for cloud deployments.</p>\n<p>With the main tools built in Rust, importantly, Marcotte (https://github.com/dphilla/marcotte) -- the underlying tool for virtualizing layers of system functionality -- allows us to make safe, sandboxed, discrete, and composable system functionality, by leveraging Rust's memory safety model, and the inherent properties of WebAssembly. </p>\n<p>This talk will critically examine this new technology, its approach, benefits, and existing limitations compared with containers, and its path forward as a new standard in cloud infrastructure.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Today there are several mature, state-of-the-art, general-purpose WebAssembly runtimes, but they are generally released as architecture- and OS-specific native binaries. </p>\n<p>Native binaries are the most general way to distribute a Wasm implementation; however, any programming language with a significant runtime environment faces some degree of friction when interfacing with native code. For instance:</p>\n<p>native code might make assumptions about memory management, which could conflict with automatic garbage collection, \nand it tends to assume ownership over threaded code, which won’t play well with abstractions over the operating system threads, such as user-space task schedulers.</p>\n<p>With “language-native runtime”, we mean a Wasm implementation that has been developed using the language of the host platform.</p>\n<p>Arguably, wazero was among the first language-native runtime environments for Wasm. wazero provides a pure-Go Wasm interpreter and a pure-Go just-in-time compiler for arm64 and amd64. But, even though this might be surprising, there are many similarities between the Go runtime and the Java runtime. </p>\n<p>We will compare how the two relate to each other while presenting Chicory, a fairly new language-native runtime written in pure-Java, featuring a Wasm interpreter and an ahead-of-time bytecode translator.</p>\n<p>By comparing wazero and Chicory, we propose language-native runtimes as a great solution to further spread Wasm for cross-platform software delivery.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p><strong>Netzgrafik-Editor (NGE)</strong> is an open-source software that enables the creation, modification, analysis and optimization of integrated interval timetables at a macroscopic level of detail, developed by Swiss Federal Railways (<a href=\"https://www.sbb.ch\">SBB CFF FFS</a>). </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/SchweizerischeBundesbahnen/netzgrafik-editor-frontend\">Source Code: Netzgrafik-Editor (github)</a>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/SchweizerischeBundesbahnen/netzgrafik-editor-frontend/blob/main/documentation/USERMANUAL.md\">User Manual: Netzgrafik-Editor</a>\n<a href=\"https://schweizerischebundesbahnen.github.io/netzgrafik-editor-frontend/\">Demo: Netzgrafik-Editor</a>\n<a href=\"https://nge.flatland.cloud\">Free Public Accessible Online Demo - Application</a></p>\n<p>Netzgrafik-Editor tackles a significant business problem by providing a robust solution for long-term timetable planning. A live demonstration will showcase the functionality and the excellent interactive user interface of the Netzgrafik-Editor.</p>\n<h4>Why a Human-Centric Approach Matters</h4>\n<p>Netzgrafik-Editor - together with our users we developed a novel approach for interactive timetable planning - user research, user involvement and usability testing were done among others to increase the user experience of the tool.</p>\n<p>The result of this human-centered approach is that the Netzgrafik-Editor is not only technically sophisticated but also intuitive and user-friendly. Planners can now create, adjust, and optimize schedules with ease. The tool adapts to their workflows, not the other way around. Users feel heard and taken seriously, which significantly increases their satisfaction and engagement.</p>\n<p>This story impressively demonstrates why a human-centered approach is so important. It ensures that technology serves people, not the other way around. The users like to use the Netzgrafik-Editor. This fosters innovation by putting actual needs at the forefront and users like to contribute and help to improve the tool which they have developed together with IT specialists. </p>\n<h4>Open Source As an Enabler</h4>\n<p>The Netzgrafik-Editor exemplifies a successful open-source project within the public transportation sectors. By embracing open collaboration, we leverage diverse expertise to address internal needs more effectively. This approach fosters a dynamic environment where building, sharing, and profiting from collective efforts become feasible. Open-source strategies enable us to reconsider traditional architecture principles, transitioning from a buy-versus-build mindset to one where open-source solutions empower us to build, share, and profit together.</p>\n<h4>Open Source is Not Enough - Attention Is All You Need</h4>\n<p>Our journey in the open-source realm has taught us valuable lessons, particularly in enhancing the visibility of our projects. Merely opening the source code is insufficient; we must also bridge the gap between software developers and end-users. By making our application freely accessible online, we ensure that it reaches a broader audience, demonstrating that open-source success relies not just on code availability but also on user engagement and accessibility.</p>\n<h4>Netzgrafik-Editor's Software - Some Insights</h4>\n<p>We have implemented much of the logic in the frontend (TypeScript) rather than the backend because performance and interactivity are crucial. Low latency and maximum responsiveness are thus ensured in the frontend.</p>\n<h4>Open Issues</h4>\n<p>One of our current key challenges is preventing forks in our open-source projects. We aim to benefit from all contributions, ensuring that enhancements and innovations made today and in the future remain integrated within the main project.</p>\n<p>Additionally, we seek ways to derive and share novel interaction design patterns that can be freely used, promoting consistency across open-source tools in similar application domains. By doing so, we hope to create a more cohesive and user-friendly ecosystem.

They collect vital data on various parameters, including track gauge and catenary height. When these measurements fall outside acceptable limits, technicians are dispatched to address the issues. Over time, certain parameters can degrade, making predictive analysis essential for anticipating maintenance needs and enhancing operational efficiency. However, both timely interventions and accurate predictive analytics hinge on precise positioning of the measurement data.</p>\n<p>In this talk, we will delve into the inner workings of an open-source library developed as part of the Openrail initiative.

    "abstract": "<p>When planning long train trips across Europe (e.g. Brussels -&gt; Sicily), standard routing criteria such as travel time and number of transfers become less relevant. I want a comfortable connection, with enough buffers, in particular when operators change. If I need to stop somewhere overnight on long trips, let’s make it a place I haven’t visited yet! But please, let’s arrive there early enough so that I have time for some touristing. Aha, there is a (non-optimal) route through Munich? That’s a chance to visit an old friend I haven’t seen in a while! Oh, I see, I have to change trains in Rome anyway? Lunch out in the sun on the piazza, that sounds fantastic. In short, for such trips, the journey can often feel as part of the destination.</p>\n<p>The criteria listed above are quite personal and often only emerge while planning the trip. Sure, existing routing tools allow me to change my search settings and re-run the search. But what I really want is to interact with the proposed travel plans, to change them how I see fit. Move connections here and there, use drag&amp;drop to try out what would happen if I did take time for that lunch in Rome, how much later would I arrive at my destination? To explore on a map what possible routes there even are, and perhaps add a little detour to a place I’ve been wanting to visit.</p>\n<p>In my project Trans-Europe-Planner (funded by prototypefund/German Ministry of Education and Research), I am building such a user interface, testing out different UX mechanisms for interactively exploring, moving connections around, trying things out, comparing options. How that all works and how users respond to it, that is what I want to discuss in my talk.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>MySQL 9.0.0 introduces a powerful new Vector data type and associated functions, adding possibilities for AI applications to use your existing MySQL database directly, instead of yet another special datastore. This talk will explore how vectors enable similarity comparisons or semantic search functionality within MySQL. We will also dive into how vector based Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) can extend Large Language Models (LLMs) by using your domain-specific data already stored in MySQL. We will also have a short comparison of the different Vector implementations in the MySQL ecosystem. By the end of this talk you will understand how MySQL’s vector capabilities can be used for your AI workflows and applications.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>As the demand for vector databases and Generative AI continues to rise, integrating vector storage and search capabilities into traditional databases has become increasingly important. This session introduces the <em>MyVector Plugin</em>, a project that brings native vector storage and similarity search to MySQL. Unlike PostgreSQL, which offers interfaces for adding new data types and index methods, MySQL lacks such extensibility. However, by utilizing MySQL's server component plugin and UDF, the <em>MyVector Plugin</em> successfully adds a fully functional vector search feature within the existing MySQL + InnoDB infrastructure, eliminating the need for a separate vector database. The session explains the technical aspects of integrating vector support into MySQL, the challenges posed by its architecture, and real-world use cases that showcase the advantages of combining vector search with MySQL's robust features. Attendees will leave with practical insights on how to add vector search capabilities to their MySQL systems.</p>",

In this talk, we’ll explore a solution to simplify this process in RPM based distros by enhancing the <code>rust2rpm</code> tool to automate the patching and repackaging of vendored dependencies.</p>\n<p>Even though the main approach is to have every dependency packaged, it often becomes really difficult to achieve that goal as you may find yourself out in a dependency hell situation where you'll have to deal with an outstanding number of them. Even if its a compromise you can bundle dependencies, but that comes with some drawbacks.</p>\n<p>When packaging, you may often find yourself in a situation where you'll  have to patch rpm's on the fly to fix out issues, but that's not really doable when you're working with bundled dependencies.</p>\n<p>We'll discuss about introducing a new <code>-p</code> flag in <code>rust2rpm</code>, which enables users to easily apply patches to vendored crates (like <code>fiat-crypto</code>), modify dependencies, and repackage them without the need for manual steps.</p>\n<p>We’ll also discuss a more flexible approach using a new helper tool, <code>rust2rpm-vendor</code>, that allows maintainers to prepare and patch vendor tarballs independently, automating the entire workflow from patch application to repacking.</p>\n<p>This talk will show how these enhancements can help alleviate \"dependency hell\" in Fedora’s Rust ecosystem, making it easier for maintainers to handle vendored crates and improve the overall Rust packaging experience.</p>\n<p>Links\n- <a href=\"https://pagure.io/fedora-rust/rust2rpm\">rust2rpm on Pagure</a></p>",

In many cases we still don't get issue reports upstream until weeks or months after a merge request landed.</p>\n<p>What's missing? Let's look at the remaining pain points around QA in the Linux OS world.

    "abstract": "<p>What if Ubuntu embraced a Rolling Release model? This might seem contradictory: Ubuntu typically follows a long-term support model with fixed, point-based releases, where packages remain stable at certain versions. In contrast, a rolling release model, commonly used by distributions based off of Arch Linux, requires ongoing, continuous package updates. While Ubuntu's standard model adheres to stability, it maintains a development branch called <code>devel</code>, akin to Debian's <code>sid</code> branch, on which it is based, and often even receiving updates sooner. While long-term support models prioritize security, rolling release models often cater more to user customization and development needs.</p>\n<p>The idea to create a rolling release variant for Ubuntu first manifested in the form of the <a href=\"https://github.com/wimpysworld/rolling-rhino\">Rolling Rhino</a> script in 2020, which allowed users to convert/upgrade their existing installs of Ubuntu to the <code>devel</code> branch, turning their familiar Ubuntu environments into Rolling Rhino ones. This concept was taken a step further in 2022, when a group of young developers turned it into a full-fledged fan flavour for Ubuntu, <a href=\"https://rollingrhino.org\">Rolling Rhino Remix</a>, which included the notable addition of two utilities: <code>rhino-config</code>, which allowed users to switch from Ubuntu’s LTS kernel to the mainline or real-time kernels, and <code>rhino-update</code>, which served as a wrapper script for updating all APT and Snap packages on the system.</p>\n<p>Rolling Rhino Remix evolved rapidly that year, undergoing numerous upgrades and integrations, with a particular focus on enhancing package management capabilities. The <code>rhino-update</code> utility added support for components such as <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/volian/nala\">Nala</a> (a <code>libapt-pkg</code> front-end alternative), Flatpak, and most importantly, the <a href=\"https://pacstall.dev\">Pacstall</a> package manager. As the project evolved, it outgrew the simple Ubuntu flavour concept, transforming into a dynamically designed developer distribution, which led to the creation of <a href=\"https://rhinolinux.org\">Rhino Linux</a>.</p>\n<p>One of the key distinctions between Rhino Linux and its predecessors is the full integration of the Pacstall package manager for handling much of the distribution’s core utilities and applications, such as the kernel, web browser, and IDE. Additionally, the distribution ships with the <code>rhino-pkg</code> utility, the successor to <code>rhino-update</code>, which serves as a wrapper script for Pacstall, APT, Flatpak, and Snap, while also extending beyond just updates, allowing users to search and install from all at once.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://pacstall.dev\">Pacstall</a> brings the package flexibility of Arch Linux’s AUR to Ubuntu and Debian, using <code>pacscripts</code> (similar to Arch's <code>PKGBUILDs</code>) to build <code>.deb</code> packages. With Pacstall, users can install from the community-maintained repository or source out-of-repository <code>.deb</code> packages, effectively making a stable Ubuntu base more adaptable to a rolling model. While Pacstall is available for almost all Ubuntu and Debian based distributions, Rhino Linux is built with Pacstall in mind from the ground up - and in consequence, the developer teams for Rhino Linux and Pacstall have largely crossed over.</p>\n<p>In this talk, two core team members will explore the history and technical foundation of both Rhino Linux and the Pacstall package manager, outline future directions, and, perhaps most importantly, share the challenges faced and insights gained from developing these projects as a small, student-led team.</p>",

    "url": "https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-5696-effects-everywhere-error-handling-and-design-by-contract-in-fuzion/",
    "abstract": "<p>This talk presents advances in the Fuzion languages focusing on effect handlers used to implement Fuzion's Design-by-Contract mechanism inspired by Betrand Meyer's Eiffel language.  The use of effect handlers for runtime checks gives a powerful means to handle failures at runtime and to create code that is robust in case of programming errors that would otherwise result in a crash. I will dive into the Fuzion effect mechanism and explain how this it is used to implement design-by-contract as pure syntax sugar in a way that permits error handling at runtime. While doing this, some new fun aspects of Fuzion like free types or partial application will be presented. The talk will use live demos of the presented mechanisms.</p>\n<h1>Introduction</h1>\n<p>Fuzion is a new functional and object-oriented language built on the universal concept of a Fuzion feature, a generalization of a pure function and a class. Effect handlers are used to model non-functional aspects. The principle of Design-by-Contract with pre- and post-conditions is used to formally document the requirements and guarantees of features in a way accessible to static analysis and runtime checks.</p>\n<h1>Fuzion Language Overview</h1>\n<p>Fuzion is a modern general purpose programming language that unifies concepts found in structured, functional and object-oriented programming languages into the concept of a Fuzion feature.  It combines a powerful syntax and safety features based on the design-by-contract principle with a simple intermediate representation that enables powerful optimizing compilers and static analysis tools to verify correctness aspects.</p>\n<p>Fuzion was influenced by many other languages including Java, Python, Eiffel, Rust, Go, Lua, Kotlin, C#, F#, Nim, Julia, Clojure, C/C++, and many more.  The goal of Fuzion is to define a language that has the expressive power present in these languages and allow high-performance implementations and powerful analysis tools.  Furthermore, Fuzion addresses requirements for safety-critical applications by adding support for contracts that enable formal specification and enable detailed control over run-time checks.</p>\n<p>Many current programming languages are getting more and more overloaded with new concepts and syntax to solve particular development or performance issues. Languages like Java/C# provide classes, interfaces, methods, packages, anonymous inner classes, local variables, fields, closures, etc.  And these languages are currently further extended by the introductions of records/structs, value types, etc.  The possibility of nesting these different concepts results in complexity for the developer and the tools (compilers, VMs) that process and execute the code.</p>\n<p>For example, the possibility to access a local variable as part of the closure of a lambda expression may result in the compiler allocating heap space to hold the contents of that local variable.  Hence, the developer has lost control over the allocation decisions made by the compiler.</p>\n<p>In Fuzion, the concepts of classes, interfaces, methods, packages, fields and local variables are unified in the concept of a Fuzion feature. The decision where to allocate the memory associated with a feature (on the heap, the stack or in a register) is left to the compiler just as well as the decision if dynamic type information is needed.  The developer is left with the single concept of a feature, the language implementation takes care of all the rest.</p>\n<h1>Error Handling using Effects</h1>\n<p>Faults are a run time manifestation of program errors (bugs).  Typical language mechanisms used to cause for runtime faults are functions <code>assert</code> or <code>panic</code> or exceptions like <code>RuntimeException</code>. Here, I will show how this is done in Fuzion using design-by-contract and effects.</p>\n<h2>Introductory Example</h2>\n<p>Consider we are writing a feature that produces a string of the form <code>9² = 81</code> for any given numeric value, we can use this code</p>\n<pre><code>square(x N : numeric) =&gt; \"{x}² = {x*x}\"\n</code></pre>\n<p>[side note: <code>N</code> is a free type, so the feature <code>square</code> is defined for any type that matches the given constraint <code>numeric</code>. Free types are syntax sugar for explicit type parameters as in</p>\n<pre><code>square(N type : numeric, x N) =&gt; \"{x}² = {x*x}\"\n</code></pre>\n<p>Alternatively, an implementation for a specific type, e.g., <code>u32</code>, would look like this</p>\n<pre><code>square(x u32) =&gt; \"{x}² = {x*x}\"\n</code></pre>\n<p>side note end]</p>\n<p>However, this will crash somewhere in the calculation of <code>x*x</code> in case of an overflow, we would like to handle this case and create an error, one solution is to add error handling using <code>panic</code>:</p>\n<pre><code>square(x N : numeric) ! panic =&gt;\n  if x *! x                         # *! checks if * operation would succeed without an overflow\n    \"{x}² = {x*x}\"\n  else\n    panic \"overflow for $x\"\n\nsquare (u8 30)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here, <code>x *! x</code> checks if the multiplication can be performed without causing an overflow, such that we can avoid the error and call <code>panic</code> explicitly.</p>\n<p>This is, however, a little ugly since it is not clear whose fault it is if this panic would occur, is the implementation of <code>square</code> faulty or is the caller to blame?</p>\n<p>Using a pre-conditions documents the requirement on the argument <code>x</code> clearly in the signature of the feature and puts the blame on the caller:</p>\n<pre><code>square(x N : numeric)\npre\n  debug: x *! x\n=&gt;\n  \"{x}² = {x*x}\"\n</code></pre>\n<h2><code>fallible</code> effect</h2>\n<p>Fuzion provides an abstract effect <code>fallible</code> with inner feature <code>try</code> that  takes a nullary lambda argument and produces a result on with inner feature <code>catch</code> that takes a lambda to be executed in case for a fault. It can be used as follows</p>\n<pre><code>FALLIBLE\n  .try ()-&gt;\n    ... code that may call FALLIBLE.cause to produce an error ...\n  .catch e-&gt;\n    ... code that handles fault with error `e` ...\n</code></pre>\n<p>The idea is that any effect that may fail due to some error would inherit from <code>fallible</code> such that there is a common way to handle this effect.</p>\n<p>One example is the <code>panic</code> effect, we can now handle a panic as follows</p>\n<pre><code>panic.try ()-&gt;\n    say (square 1000000)\n  .catch s\n    say \"square panicked: $s\"\n</code></pre>\n<p>If not run within an explicit <code>panic.try</code>, the default panic handler will be invoked which propagate the panic to <code>fuzion.runtime.fault</code>.</p>\n<h2>fallible hierarchy</h2>\n<p>Similar to Java using the class inheritance mechanism to create a hierarchy of <code>Throwable</code> exceptions, we would like to have a hierarchy of <code>fallible</code> effects. In Fuzion, this is done via default handlers that propagate to a more generic fallible, where <code>fuzion.runtime.fault</code> is the most generic one.</p>\n<h2>pre and post-conditions as effects</h2>\n<p>Fuzion defines a hierarchy of <code>fallible</code>effects as follows</p>\n<pre><code>                   fuzion.runtime.fault\n                              A\n                              |\n                   +----------+--------------+\n                   |                         |\n       fuzion.runtime.contract_fault       panic\n                   |\n          +--------+-----------------+\n          |                          |\nfuzion.runtime.pre_fault    fuzion.runtime.post_fault\n</code></pre>\n<p>Pre- and post-conditions in Fuzion source code are essentially syntax sugar for code using the corresponding <code>pre_fault</code> and <code>post_fault</code> effects. The example above is de-sugared to code like this:</p>\n<pre><code>pre_square(x N : numeric) =&gt;\n  if !(debug: x *! x)\n    fuzion.runtime.pre_fault.env.cause \"debug: x *! x\"\n\npre_and_square(x N : numeric) =&gt;\n  pre_square x\n  square x\n\nsquare(x N : numeric) =&gt;\n  \"{x}² = {x*x}\"\n\npre_and_square (u8 30)\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Programmatic handling of faults</h2>\n<p>Now, it is possible to install handlers for a particular <code>fallible</code> at given points in the hierarchy, e.g., for <code>pre_fault</code> for preconditions only, <code>contract_fault</code> to handle <code>pre_fault</code> and <code>post_fault</code>, or the topmost <code>fault</code> to handle <code>pre_fault</code>, <code>post_fault</code>, <code>panic</code> and all other <code>fallible</code> that map to <code>fault</code>.</p>\n<h1>Type constraints</h1>\n<p>Using our square example with pre-condition, we see that the code does not work as expected for a float overflow:</p>\n<pre><code>say (square 3.2E200)\n</code></pre>\n<p>produces</p>\n<pre><code>3.2E200² = Infinity\n</code></pre>\n<p>instead of reporting an overflow. Using type constraints, we can specialize the code for specific type parameter values. In this example, we can extend our code to handle <code>float</code> differently in the pre-condition and disallow <code>N.infinity</code> as the result of squaring:</p>\n<pre><code>square(x N : numeric) ! panic\n  pre\n    debug: x *! x\n    debug: (if N : float then x*x != N.infinity else true)\n=&gt;\n  \"{x}² = {x*x}\"\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here, the <code>N : float</code> in the second precondition provides specific code for float types. The code in the following <code>then</code> clause sees <code>N</code> and all values of type <code>N</code> with the type constraint <code>float</code>, so it is possible to, e.g., access <code>N.infinity</code>, which is a type feature defined for <code>float</code> only.</p>\n<p>Type constraints like <code>N : float</code> are compile time constants since a copy of <code>square</code> will be created for each actual type <code>N</code>, so these can be optimized away for all other types.</p>\n<p>Such type constraints are extremely useful. E.g., Fuzion's base library feature <code>Sequence</code> contains a <code>sort</code> feature as follows</p>\n<pre><code>public sort\npre\n  T : property.orderable\n=&gt;\n  sort_by (&lt;=)\n</code></pre>\n<p>the precondition ensures that <code>sort</code> will only be called if the element type <code>T</code> of the <code>Sequence</code> defines an order, which permits using `&lt;='.</p>\n<p>[side note: partial application comes to our help here. Without, the code would look like this</p>\n<pre><code>  sort_by (a,b -&gt; a &lt;= b)\n</code></pre>\n<p>]</p>\n<h1>Conclusion and Next Steps</h1>\n<p>The implementation of Design-by-Contract using effect handlers is another step to simplify the language implementation by degrading this mechanism to syntax sugar for code using effects. At the same time, this makes the language more powerful by enabling code to handle failures at runtime.</p>\n<p>A small team of developers is working on bringing Fuzion ahead. The main focus of the work at the moment are</p>\n<ul>\n<li>first real-world applications</li>\n<li>a powerful standard library</li>\n<li>foreign language interfaces for C and Java</li>\n<li>improving static analyzers</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Main points that are missing right now are</p>\n<ul>\n<li>additional library modules for all sorts of application needs</li>\n<li>better code optimization like inlining, specialization</li>\n<li>highly optimizing back-ends</li>\n<li>documentation, tutorials</li>\n<li>more enthusiastic contributors and users!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please feel free to contact me in case you want to use Fuzion or want to help making it a success!</p>\n<h1>Links</h1>\n<p>Fuzion portal website: https://fuzion-lang.dev\nFuzion Sources on GitHub: https://github.com/tokiwa-software/fuzion</p>",

What’s special about the Shepherd is that it’s minimalistic and extensible: it’s written in Guile Scheme, the language also used by Guix, and its configuration file is a Scheme snippet that declares services.  Want a special type of service?  It may be that you can implement it right in your config file!</p>\n<p>In this talk, I’ll focus on gems of the Shepherd’s internals.  Not only is it written in a high-level functional language in a space where C is dominating, it also follows an actor-style architecture powered by Fibers.  These choices bring a level of flexibility and elegance likely to bring happiness to anyone who dives in the code, as we will see.  It also brings its own challenges, sometimes even sweat and tears; I’ll also reflect on them in this talk.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>VACASK is a novel FOSS analog circuit simulator with a clear separation between device models (i.e. equations) and circuit analyses. It is based on the state of the art KLU sparse matrix library and utilizes the OpenVAF Verilog-A compiler for building its device models from Verilog-A sources. A comparison with other FOSS analog circuit simulators is presented and the roadmap for future development is discussed. A major obstacle in development of VACASK (and every other new simulator) is the implementation of legacy device models that boils down to writing tens of thousands of lines of C code. Legacy device models are used in several older PDKs as well as in models of a large number of discrete electronic components. A novel approach to implementing these device models is proposed: a converter from SPICE3 API-based C code into modern Verilog-A code. The limitations of the approach are presented and the validation of the resulting Verilog-A models is discussed. The performance of the converted models is compared to that of native SPICE3 models. At the present the converted models can be used in VACASK and Ngspice circuit simulators as well as in any other simulator that supports Verilog-A. Some alternative use cases for the converter are proposed and a roadmap for its future development is presented.</p>",

The standard expertly allows for\nvendor-independent representations of modern circuit designs.</p>\n<p>1 In this talk, we will explain the new revision of our proposed IEEE 1364-2005\n  compliant schematic interchange format, and how seamless interaction will\n  empower FOSS EDA tools. We will outline work in progress, possibly demonstrate\n  an application, and hint at opportunities. We will explain how the interchange\n  will extend towards PCB design and layout</p>\n<p>2 We will summarise new mixed signal features available in modelgen-verilog.\n  This includes monitored analog events, as well as discrete modelling in terms\n  of user defined primitives. We will expand on the usefulness of discrete\n  disciplines and \"connect modules\", and give an update on the implementation\n  status.</p>\n<p>3 On the algorithmic end, we have added a plugin interface for VLSI-ready\n  matrix solvers to the zoo. We will highlight a new solver combining temporal\n  sparsity with the time/space efficiency of \"conventional sparse\" LU\n  decomposition. We will explain why Gnucap will outpace traditional (open\n  source) solvers on virtually all instances, both small and big circuits.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>In the field of semiconductor technology, compact modeling, and IC designs, the OpenPDK Initiative provides an international platform for discussing advanced technologies, fostering collaboration among industry and academic leaders in electronic design automation (EDA). We review selected R\\&amp;D topics presented at a recent event by prominent academic researchers and industrial professionals who presented and discussed innovative approaches in CAD/EDA tools, techniques including compact/SPICE modeling, and IC design that address the demands of emerging semiconductor technology applications. However, the semiconductor industry also faces many challenges in maintaining the growth of its workforce with skilled technicians and engineers. To address the increasing need for well-trained workers worldwide, we must find innovative ways to attract skilled talent and strengthen the local semiconductor workforce ecosystem. The FOSS CAD/EDA tools with the recently available open access PDKs provide a new platform to connect IC design beginners, enthusiasts and experienced mentors to benefit from the collaboration opportunities enabled by the fast-growing open-source IC design movement. The collaborative development of open-source integrated circuit (IC) designs is becoming increasingly feasible due to the rapid expansion of OpenPDKs recently offered by SkyWater, GF and IHP with an open schedule of MPW Runs for FMD-QNC project in 2024-25. This paper demonstrates the FOSS CAD/EDA contribution to the SPICE/Verilog-A modeling/standardization, compete IC design flow (Xschem, Qucs-S, ngspice, Xyce, OpenVAF, OpenEMS, Magic, kLayout, OpenRoad), in addition selected, open-source examples of analog/RF and digital IC designs will be presented.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>The OpenFlexure Microscope is an open source laboratory-grade digital robotic microscope. As a robotic microscope, it is able to automatically scan microscope slides creating, enormous multi-gigapixel digital representations of samples. The microscope is already undergoing evaluation for malaria and cancer diagnosis in Tanzania, Rwanda, and the Philippines. As an open project our key goal is to support local manufacturing of microscopes in low resource settings. But, how can an open source project empower local manufacturers to make hardware certified for diagnostic use?</p>\n<p>Collaborative hardware design is notoriously difficult without complex Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) systems. However, Git provides more powerful version control than the most expensive proprietary PLM systems, especially if you use a code-based CAD package. Platforms like GitLab give clear records of project management through issue and merge request threads. Also, CI pipelines give us the ability to perform regular code quality checks, automate the generation of print-ready 3D models, and to generate detailed always-up-to-date assembly documentation and diagrams.</p>\n<p>This high-quality consistent documentation has enabled thousands of microscopes to be built around the world, in over 50 countries. Microscopes have been used on all seven continents, from the Antarctic sea ice to the rainforest in Panama. They have been used for educational workshops in Sweden and Ghana, and even built by mobile makerspaces in wartime Ukraine. Hospitals already use the microscope to for remote consultancy and training, however without certification it cannot be used for diagnosis.</p>\n<p>Combining good documentation with accessible calibration routines, gives manufacturers and users confidence that their locally-manufactured device performs as well as the thousands of other OpenFlexure Microscopes around the world. Building in robust calibration is crucial in our push towards medical certification.</p>\n<p>This talk will involve live microscopy demonstrations, give an overview of the microscope and its applications, as well as diving into deeper questions of open source workflows for managing diagnostic device design.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>As everyone involved with SBOMs knows, the accurate and efficient recording of data about software components is crucial for security, compliance, and operational efficiency. This presentation introduces a novel data modeling approach that leverages an ontology in RDF terms, similar to the approach used by SPDX. This new model distinguishes between abstract software components and specific software packages, providing a more granular and efficient way to manage software metadata.\nTraditionally, SBOMs have focused on recording information about software packages, such as \"OpenSSL v3.0.1 distributed by Ubuntu\" or \"OpenSSL v3.1.1 distributed by Debian.\" However, this approach can lead to redundancy and inefficiencies, particularly when dealing with licensing information and other metadata that is common across multiple versions and distributions of the same software. Our novel ontology introduces the concept of a \"component\" as an abstract reference to a piece of software, distinct from a \"package,\" which represents a specific version of the software distributed by a particular supplier.\nBy implementing this distinction, our ontology allows for the creation of relationships between different parts of the software ecosystem. For example, both \"OpenSSL v3.0.1 distributed by Ubuntu\" and \"OpenSSL v3.1.1 distributed by Debian\" can be linked to the abstract component \"OpenSSL.\" This relationship-based approach not only enhances the clarity and organization of SBOM data but also leads to significant storage savings. Common information, such as the licensing terms of a component, can be stored once and referenced across multiple packages, eliminating redundancy.\nThe practical application of this ontology can be demonstrated by a new tool called TOSCA (The Open Source Component Aggregator) that we have developed. TOSCA demonstrates the power and efficiency of this data model by aggregating and managing millions of data points about open-source components. While the presentation will primarily focus on the ontology and its benefits, TOSCA will be mentioned as a proof of concept that highlights the real-world applicability and advantages of this approach.</p>",

That way the license metadata travels with the file even if it was copied from its original package/repository into a different one.</p>\n<p>Client-side JavaScript, CSS and similar languages that make up a large chunk of the web are often concatenated, minified and even uglified in an attempt to make the website faster to load. In this process, most often, the comments get culled the first to reduce the number of characters that serve no function to the program code itself.</p>\n<p>The problem therefore is that typically when JavaScript, CSS (or similar client-side code) is being built, it tends to lose not just comments that describe the code’s functionality, but also comments that carry licensing and copyright information. And since licenses (FOSS or not) typically require the text of the license and copyright notices to be kept with the code, such removal can be problematic.</p>\n<p>A few months ago I <a href=\"https://matija.suklje.name/persistent-copyright-licensing-information-in-client-side-javascript-css-and-similar-a-proposal-call-for-help\">proposed a way to preserve SPDX tags even in minified code</a>. This proposal relies solely on commonly used tooling and existing wide-spread standards/specs (<a href=\"https://spdx.org\">SPDX</a> and <a href=\"https://reuse.software\">REUSE</a>), but applies the <code>SPDX-Snippet-*</code> tags in an inventive way to achieve this.</p>\n<p>In this talk I will briefly present that proposal, followed by the feedback I received up until FOSDEM, and – most importantly – a hopefully lively discussion to come up with a much better proposal.</p>\n<p>The ultimate goal is to finally figure out how to make the client-side web JS/CSS easy to reuse and ship in a license-compliant way.

    "abstract": "<p>Batteries are a bottleneck in the energy transition. They can be expensive, require strict operating conditions, and may pose safety risks. Batteries degrade with time and use. Some chemistries rely on problematic minerals in their supply chains and others are hard to recycle at the end of their useful lives.</p>\n<p>Yet, batteries can unlock clean mobility, stabilize electrical networks powered by intermittent renewables, provide backup emergency power, enable off-grid systems, and many other benefits. Many closed-source enterprises are competing to provide solutions in this space, but the commercial path to scale is difficult, with many startups running out of funding before their product hits the market. When they’re in business, there is little transparency or external validation of their development process, and if they go out of business, the wider community learns little from their failures.</p>\n<p>We will present our efforts as part of the Flow Battery Research Collective (FBRC) to develop an open-source battery technology for stationary applications. FBRC is developing a battery designed for stationary energy storage use at the residential scale, that aims to be cheaper, safer, longer lasting, more sustainable, and more recyclable than current technologies. We’ll give a quick overview of existing battery technologies and cover the fundamentals of the technology we are working with—flow batteries—and why we picked this technology. </p>\n<p>We’ll cover our progress so far, our roadmap, and how we plan to integrate with the many open-source power electronics and battery/energy management systems that exist on the other side of our development gap. Network-connected batteries need secure software/firmware to operate safely; we will go over some ways in which a (flow) battery could be abused if a bad actor were able to control the system remotely. Finally, we will present our personal observations on launching an open-source, mechanical/chemical hardware project and how it aligns with/diverges from conventional open-source software communities.</p>",

Overall, ICT accounts for 2-3% of global CO2 emissions, which is on a par with the aviation industry; if nothing changes, by 2050 this will rise to over 30%. When looking at emissions over the lifespan of devices, the vast majority of CO2 (85+%) comes from production, not usage.</p>\n<p>Moving to a circular economy can reduce the disproportionate energy consumption and CO2 emissions associated with hardware manufacturing. Hardware and software are inextricably linked, and a Free Software license disrupts the produce-use-dispose linear model of hardware and enable the shift to a reduce-reuse-recycle circular model. In this talk I provide an overview of the environmental harm driven by both hardware and software and how FOSS is well-positioned to address the issues. I will link the inherent values that come with a Free &amp; Open Source Software license to sustainable software design. Finally, I will present the various ways that Free Software can prevent the unnecessary production of new devices, whether by adapting the software to hardware one already owns, or recycling existing software to support the newest hardware being produced.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Open communication protocols and open source software go hand in hand and fuel each other. But there is a potential chicken-and-egg problem: Should the OEMs support it first, or are they waiting for widespread support of the protocol in EMS implementations (who are hesitant if the OEMs don't support it)?</p>\n<p>The only forward is to start showing real solutions and implementations with front-runners from both sides. Then, these smaller showcases can become an avalanche and lift the sector up in an open way. Both steps are difficult and need partnerships.</p>\n<p>Energy flexibility optimization behind the meter is already deployed in practice. However, networking protocols and definitions of flexibility are used which are not standardized and not openly available. This makes building new solutions with new flexible energy assets (like EVs, batteries, heat pumps and also solar inverters) a chore and drives up costs. Each new energy asset (or new brand) has to be integrated with their specific protocols and patterns. New protocols attempt to standardize these concepts, such as the S2 protocol. It targets an international audience for both existing and new/future energy assets. See https://s2standard.org/ </p>\n<p>S2 is approved as European standard, but the next batteline is to showcase that implementations can work and that both sides, OEMs and EMS, are willing to get to work. Open source implementations will provide building blocks and serve as reference.</p>\n<p>This presentation will show the efforts and experiences of two different consortia, from different implementation projects, with adopting the protocol and creating tools to spur adoption by other innovators and OEMs. Of course, we will also briefly outline the protocol itself, and address differences and shared features in other existing protocols in this space, like EEBus and OpenADR.</p>\n<p>We hope this talk can spur more interest and collaboration in this space and towards a lift for open efforts in the industry. </p>\n<p>Join our presentation if you want to learn more about protocol standardization efforts within the energy transition and S2 specifically!</p>",

In this presentation we are sharing the results: residents actually participate and change their behaviour.</p>\n<p>In the initial step we took a gamification approach where everybody can participate, regardless of their personal situation. Now, with active involvement of Alliander we are extending the approach towards automation logic for charging, thermostats and home batteries. We will share the forecasting and optimisation methods we are using for combining automation with the original gamification.</p>\n<p>The next challenge is to enable users to participate in additional markets at the same time without creating conflicts: local congestion, dynamic tariffs, energy sharing and even seasonal storage. With that in mind we started additional projects with the City of The Hague and DSO Stedin, as well as with the City of Arnhem and DSO Alliander. We are combining household participation in reducing net congestion with optimising shared assets such as district batteries and public charging. Jointly we started a collaboration with GOPACS (the Dutch congestion management portal) to enable the energy community of residents to trade, a first of it's kind.

    "abstract": "<p>Heating and cooling account for around 50% of Europe’s final energy consumption, making renewable heating and cooling technologies a significant lever to reduce carbon emissions. One well established renewable heat technology is solar thermal. Solar thermal systems use solar radiation to heat a working fluid directly, providing a low-cost heat source with a significantly better specific yield per unit of collector area than PV. Solar thermal collectors have been used to supplement domestic hot water heating for decades, but more recently the market for large solar thermal arrays to supply bulk heat to district heating systems or industrial customers has begun to grow significantly. At present long-term monitoring of these systems is carried out using a variety of proprietary tools developed by industry stakeholders – with limited agreement on methodology and little transparency on the algorithms being employed – or not at all. To address this, the international standard ISO 24194 was published in 2022, providing an open standard for the assessment of the performance of solar thermal arrays in operation. The SunPeek project is the first open-source implementation of this standard and aims to become the reference implementation by providing an open, trusted, user friendly application with well documented design decisions in cases where the standard is ambiguous. SunPeek is designed with highly automated workflows in mind and includes robust data preprocessing and error checking. It also includes several extensions of the ISO methodology to allow valid assessments to be made under a wider range of operating conditions, and funding has been secured to add fault detection, localization and remediation decision support functionality.  </p>\n<p>Several use cases are cases envisioned including: </p>\n<p>Long term automated regular performance assessment. </p>\n<p>performance guarantee verification (a use case which clearly demonstrates the value of being open source, due to verifiability of the codebase) </p>\n<p>Research applications </p>\n<p>Integration into existing fully featured plant monitoring solutions.  </p>\n<p>Different interfaces and packaging formats are provided to support these.  </p>\n<p>The core functionality is written in python, and made available as a package on PyPi (https://pypi.org/project/sunpeek/). </p>\n<p>A set of docker images and a compose configuration allow deployment as a web application with Vue.js based user interface and FastAPI based REST API. </p>\n<p>The project is hosted on GitLab (https://gitlab.com/sunpeek), documentation is at https://docs.sunpeek.org and a demo is available at https://demo.sunpeek.org. </p>\n<p>This work has been supported by the Austrian Research Promotion Agency (project HarvestIT, project number FFG 887648, and IEA SHC Task 68, FO999890460) and the European Commission (project IndHeap, proposal number 101136140).</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Energy services are highly interconnected with socio-economic development and human well-being. Yet, life without reliable energy is a reality for more than 675 million people globally, while more than 2 billion people use polluting fuels to cook their meals. Addressing the critical challenge of extending energy access to the unserved and underserved communities, more than six decades after full electrification in Europe and the United States, is imperative. Unfortunately, the current trajectory falls short. The latest SDG 7 Tracking Report highlights that the world is off course in achieving Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7 by 2030, with 85% of those without electricity residing in Sub-Saharan Africa. The repercussions of this shortfall are significant, with adverse impacts on societies and economies: inadequate healthcare persists, educational institutions struggle to provide quality education, and agricultural and industrial sectors face competitiveness challenges in regions where reliable energy remains elusive. Despite efforts such as grid extension, community-run mini-grids, and individual household solutions, progress has been insufficient because these solutions haven't been delivered at scale, in a coordinated way. We urgently require access to data, analytical tools and innovative strategies to deliver affordable, reliable, and clean energy to those who lack access to it. While existing solutions have primarily focused on supply-side and technology-centric approaches, there's a crucial need to prioritize demand-side perspectives to truly meet the needs of users, whether households or institutions.</p>\n<p>What is the Energy Access Explorer (EAE)? \nTo help address this challenge, WRI, in collaboration with partners has developed the Energy Access Explorer (https://www.energyaccessexplorer.org/; https://github.com/energyaccessexplorer) (EAE), a data-driven, integrated and inclusive approach to achieving universal access to energy for equitable, socio-economic development. EAE is the first, open-source, online and interactive geospatial platform that enables energy planners, clean energy entrepreneurs, donors, and development institutions to identify high-priority areas for energy access interventions. EAE functions also as a dynamic information system, reducing software engineering and data transaction costs for both data providers and users and facilitating data management and governance.  </p>\n<p>Use cases \nWith over 25,000 users, 48% of which are women, EAE users can customize the analysis and identify areas of interest based on their perspective. More specifically, the use of this platform enables the following:</p>\n<p>Energy Planning Agencies improve the ways integrated and inclusive planning is carried out using a data-informed approach. They will explore the potential for grid extension, off grid systems, clean cooking technologies and renewables for expanding energy access where needed the most. Clean Energy Enterprises, especially the ones with limited or no market intelligence / GIS capacity in house, identify new market opportunities. They will access demographic, socio-economic data, consumer ability to pay for energy services combined with information on energy resource availability and power infrastructure to locate priority areas for expanding their businesses.  Service Delivery Institutions in the health, education, productive use of energy, agriculture sectors get a better understanding of energy needs associated to development services. Clean Cooking agencies identify areas where the uptake of clean cooking technologies should be prioritized based on location specific data on demand, supply and environment. Donors and Development Finance Institutions identify areas where their grants and investment will have the most impact.  </p>\n<p>Outcomes to Date\nTo date, EAE has contributed to: the Powering Healthcare Roadmap of the Government of Zambia and the Powering Healthcare initiative of the Health Ministry in Uganda, the development of local, integrated and inclusive County Energy Plans in Kenya, to support the 0.5 billion USD Africa Mini Grid and the Energizing Agriculture Program in Nigeria, to inform the results based financing scheme for off grid electrification in Ethiopia and to establish cross sectoral EAE working groups enabling an integrated and inclusive approach to planning.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Decentralized Electric Utilities (DEUs) and Solar-Home-System distributors (SHS-D) are increasingly emerging to reach and serve deep rural unelectrified communities in the global south (mainly in Africa and Asia). These DEUs &amp; SHS-D are required to handle a vast and complex range of technical (e.g., energy, power, etc. ) and financial data points from their operations daily. Particularly, domestic small and midsize entrepreneurs find themselves hands-tied in their quest to digitize and optimize their operations, allowing them to scale and reach more unserved rural communities. The integrations with different energy asset communications and the integrations with payment providers (e.g., mobile money, which is widely used) come with significant efforts for these small-size companies. Therefore, we see an enormous value (in supporting bottom-up, locally driven rural electrification) in the provision and maintenance of the Open Source MicroPowerManager, where all those integrations and interopearbilities need to be set up only on time and benefit a variety of domestic companies and initiatives. Also, the operational and business models of the different DEUs and SHS-D are generally slightly different. The core processes are the same, and the Open Source MicroPowerManage software provides all the required basic functionalities to ease these processes. </p>\n<p>In the presentation, we will dive into the current technology setup of the Project, both organizationally and technically. We want to shed light on the MicroPowerManager, its current functionalities, feature pipeline, particular technical and community-building challenges, and other possible use opportunities. We hope to have fruitful exchanges and interesting feedback from the community; maybe one or the other wants to support our journey.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Off-grid rural electrification faces significant challenges, including unreliable grid connections, high variability in renewable energy generation, and limited financial resources. In many regions, such as Sub-Saharan Africa, weakly-connected mini-grids present a promising solution; however, their operation is often constrained, if not undermined, by uncertainties in energy demand, renewable production, and frequent grid outages. Addressing these challenges requires advanced optimization techniques to ensure reliable, cost-effective energy access.</p>\n<p>The Autarky model, developed in Julia, offers an innovative approach to optimizing the economic dispatch of renewable-powered, weakly-connected mini-grids under uncertainty. By integrating Joint Chance Constraints (JCC), the model ensures robust operation during outages and renewable variability while maintaining reliability at a predefined probability level. It addresses four key uncertainties: solar power forecasting errors, load demand forecasting errors, and the timing and duration of main grid outages. The model strategically schedules diesel generators and battery reserves to maximize operational efficiency and guarantee energy supply even during grid disruptions.\nAutarky is benchmarked against three alternative approaches — Individual Chance Constraints (ICC), an Expected-Value Model (EVM), and a Regular deterministic model — to evaluate the trade-offs between reliability and cost. The framework is validated through a real-world case study of a mini-grid in Lake Victoria, Tanzania. Results demonstrate that the JCC model achieves a 90% probability of successful islanding with 3-hour daily grid outages, significantly enhancing reliability compared to ICC (58%) and EVM (20%), while leading to a 25% reduction in profit.</p>\n<p>Key contributions of this work include:\n•   A stochastic optimization framework tailored for weakly-connected mini-grids, integrating multivariate Gaussian distributions through spherical-radial decomposition.\n•   A comparative analysis of dispatch strategies, quantifying the trade-offs between cost and reliability across different models.\n•   A practical case study using real-world data from Tanzania, validating the model's effectiveness in addressing uncertainties and improving energy access.\nBy fostering open-source collaboration, Autarky aspires to accelerate the global deployment of resilient mini-grids, thereby contributing to universal clean energy access and the realization of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG-7). </p>\n<p>The model is openly accessible on GitHub. \nLink: https://github.com/Autarky-Power/Minigrid-JCC/</p>",

It is complex, hard and central to decarbonizing society.  <br />\nYet, despite its key role in the transition, power electronics is still an obscure discipline only properly understood by a handful few. It has not yet gone through the type of open-source fast-prototyping revolution brought about by Arduino or Raspberry Pi in the industrial informatics and computer fields.\nWe at OwnTech are dedicated to do just that: revolutionize the way power electronics is taught, understood and used in the field.\nLast year we introduced ourselves to the FOSDEM community, this year we bring the updates and showcase our consolidated open-software and open-hardware advancements.<br />\nIn this talk we will briefly describe the origin of our project, our technology and provide a working demo of our V1 embedded software. We will also show you our hardware, the types of functions it can provide and how it can become a game-changer in the power electronics fast prototyping community.<br />\nSee you at the FOSDEM Energy DevRoom!</p>",

    "abstract": "<p><a href=\"https://citycatalyst.openearth.org/\">CityCatalyst</a> is an Open Source Web application for managing a city's climate journey. Cities can start tracking greenhouse gas emissions using CityCatalyst from a variety of sectors -- buildings, transportation, waste, agriculture, industry -- in the <a href=\"https://ghgprotocol.org/ghg-protocol-cities\">GHG Protocol for Cities (GPC) format</a>. They can assemble emissions data from different public data sources, including nationally-tracked environmental data, AI models, or satellite data. They can also update their emissions data manually, using well-established methodologies. The reports generated by these emissions inventories can be shown on a public dashboard for citizens or disclosed to investors or international tracking organizations. Upcoming versions of the platform will also include risk assessments (what effect will climate change have on the city?) and action planning (what can the city do to lower risk and emissions). As an Open Source tool, CityCatalyst lowers the costs of climate change tracking and puts power into the hands of cities of all sizes and in all parts of the globe.</p>\n<p>CityCatalyst is built using the open source projects React, NextJS, ChakraUI, Tailwind, PostgreSQL, Sequelize, Nivo, Pigeon Maps and many more.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/Open-Earth-Foundation/CityCatalyst\">Project repository on Github</a></p>",

    "abstract": "<p>The Digital Services Act (DSA) has introduced several transparency provisions for providers of online platforms, strengthening users’ rights to information about the content moderation systems they are subjected to. In particular, online platforms are obliged to inform their users of the content moderation decisions they take and explain the reasons behind those decisions in so-called Statements of Reasons (SoR). To enhance transparency and facilitate scrutiny over content moderation decisions, platforms have to submit these SoRs to a publicly available database, the “<a href=\"https://transparency.dsa.ec.europa.eu/\">DSA Transparency Database</a>\", managed by the European Commission. </p>\n<p>This database allows to track a standardised set of metadata about each content moderation decision (with any personal data removed) taken by providers of online platforms in almost real-time. Its website also offers various tools for accessing, analyzing, and downloading the information related to the content moderation decisions taken by online platforms, contributing to the monitoring of the dissemination of illegal and harmful content online. </p>\n<p>However, due to their size and number of attributes, accessing and analyzing these data has been a significant challenge for researchers. To address this, the Transparency Database team has developed <a href=\"https://code.europa.eu/dsa/transparency-database/dsa-tdb\">dsa_tdb</a>, a Python package that enables users to easily access, analyze, and inspect the Statements of Reasons listed in the Transparency Database. </p>\n<p>This talk will showcase the capabilities of <code>dsa_tdb</code>, highlighting its potential for researchers, policymakers, and civil society organizations. We will demonstrate the wide array of tools that the package (and its containerized application) offers to users featuring different levels of technical knowledge, from quick dashboarding and visualizations to more advanced data processing. We will also show how the package can be used to uncover trends and patterns in platform content moderation activities and discuss the implications of these findings for the development of more transparent and accountable online ecosystems. </p>\n<p>In addition to presenting <code>dsa_tdb</code>, we will also discuss the broader transparency provisions introduced by the DSA, including the database tracking the online platforms’ terms and conditions, the Advertisement repositories, the Transparency reports, and the Transparency Database itself. We will explore how these provisions can be leveraged to promote greater transparency and accountability in the digital services sector, and discuss the challenges and opportunities associated with their implementation.</p>\n<p>You can check the <code>dsa_tdb</code> code repository <a href=\"https://code.europa.eu/dsa/transparency-database/dsa-tdb\">here</a>: https://code.europa.eu/dsa/transparency-database/dsa-tdb</p>\n<p>... as well as its <a href=\"https://dsa.pages.code.europa.eu/transparency-database/dsa-tdb/\">online documentation</a>: https://dsa.pages.code.europa.eu/transparency-database/dsa-tdb/</p>",

While real challenges exist which are causing economic harm to entire sectors, politicians remain focused on social media use-cases. Meanwhile, industry self-regulation is not capable of producing authenticators of sufficiently robust fundamental rights protections. Hardware anchored solutions are beneficial to industries in some member states, while software anchored solutions leave more space for industries in others. </p>\n<p>We will present the arising problems with regards to fundamental rights, national security and the challenge to find solutions for the time until 2031.

Defined as open-source software, open data, open AI models, and open content that meet privacy, security, and interoperability best practices, DPGs offer governments the tools to build equitable, transparent, and sustainable digital systems.\nThis session highlights recent advancements in the DPG Standard—the framework for vetting and recognizing DPGs—alongside collaborative efforts, such as UNICEF’s leadership in scaling DPGs globally. It will also explore successful implementations in Europe through practical examples, including:\n1. Primero (UNICEF): A DPG helping social service workers manage sensitive data related to child protection and gender-based violence.\n2.

    "abstract": "<p>The concept of Digital Commons – highly open and shared digital resources which are maintained and governed by communities – represents a transformative approach to building a more open and equitable digital ecosystem. Through the Next Generation Internet (NGI) Commons project, supported by the European Commission, ‘Europe’ as such is developing an intellectual and policy basis for investing in and supporting Digital Commons as providers of public digital infrastructures that support European digital sovereignty and advance European values around digital-era governance.</p>\n<p>This session will explore all the latest thinking around Digital Commons as a policy priority for Europe, through the prism of how Europe’s existing corpus of digital regulation – such as the Interoperable Europe Act and the AI Act – will be implemented, as well as by examining the activities and collaboration happening organically between European Member States. In so doing, it will highlight how community-driven governance models for open technologies – in particular, open source software – can promote collaboration, support reuse and maintenance of open technologies, and ultimately reduce dependencies on monopolistic platforms which are not aligned with European values.</p>\n<p>More specifically, the session will delve into the practical frameworks and policy recommendations emerging from the NGI Commons initiative, showing how Digital Commons support and enable various existing and new policy initiatives in Europe, including the agenda of the new Commission and the work of the new Executive Vice President for Tech Sovereignty, Security and Democracy, Henna Virkkunen. It will also elevate the work of various Member States, such as France, Germany, Estonia, and the Netherlands, and amplify new knowledge around some of the most prominent Digital Commons projects and communities from across the continent.</p>",

Some of the central questions the project wants to answer are: How can the different service offerings across a wide array of providers be unified? How can they communicate in a common language?</p>\n<p>We discuss how a combination of Cloud Native building blocks that emerged from the Kubernetes ecosystem (kcp and kube-bind, among others) could be used to create the foundation for the next generation of cloud platforms.</p>\n<p>We demonstrate a prototype which meshes together declarative APIs that allows us to consume services across multiple control plane instances, instantiating what we call the “Platform Mesh”. As an outlook, we connect the development of declarative APIs to ongoing European developments coming from the upcoming regulations on switching data processing services from within the Data Act, and possible future legislation fostering interoperability in the cloud native computing landscape.</p>\n<p>This talk is a call for action for how to build the next level of European platforms, addressing key European Union objectives in cloud computing sovereignty and standardization.</p>\n<h2>We will conclude by discussing how this reference architecture aligns with broader EU initiatives in technological sovereignty and cross-border digital service integration</h2>\n<p>Links\n- https://www.kcp.io/ (framework behind platform mesh)\n- https://apeirora.eu/ (project initiative)\n- https://www.ecofed.eu/ (collaborators)</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>GFOSS (Greek Free/Open Source Software Society), with its 16 year history as an umbrella organization representing 37 academic institutions and research centers, is expanding its membership model to include private IT companies through an innovative approach that goes beyond traditional industry representation and participation. This talk presents our framework for creating meaningful academic-industry collaboration in open technologies, including staff exchange programs between member companies and universities, targeted career development initiatives, and collaborative open source project development through projectathons and hackathons.\nWe will share our vision for a dynamic ecosystem where private sector membership in GFOSS offers a value proposition that includes direct access to academic research and talent pools, participation in joint research projects, opportunities for private sector staff to engage in academic teaching and research and pathways for commercial adoption of academic open source projects. \nThe framework also addresses practical aspects such as revenue-based tiered membership fees, balanced voting mechanisms, and special provisions for startups. Our primary focus is on creating sustainable, mutually beneficial relationships between academia and industry that advance open source adoption and innovation. Insights gained from GFOSS framework approach will inform future policy proposals at both national and European levels, particularly regarding research funding mechanisms, public procurement specifications, and innovation support programs.</p>",

    "abstract": "<h4>Duration:</h4>\n<p>60 minutes (this can be adjusted and shortened if necessary)</p>\n<h4>Format:</h4>\n<p>Participatory workshop</p>\n<h4>Context:</h4>\n<p><strong>OSS</strong> has become a <strong>cornerstone of innovation, collaboration, and digital sovereignty</strong> in Europe. However, its widespread <strong>adoption</strong> and <strong>integration</strong> into both public and private sectors <strong>face numerous challenges</strong>. Despite its <strong>benefits</strong>-including enhanced transparency, reduced costs, and technological independence-<strong>various actors</strong>, from corporations to grassroots to public entities, <strong>remain hesitant to adopt OSS solutions</strong>.</p>\n<h4>Objectives:</h4>\n<p>This <strong>participatory workshop</strong> aims at answering two pressing questions.<em>(i) How do we increase Open Source Software uptake and awareness by companies?</em> and <em>(ii) How do we remove existing barriers for Open Source Software uptake in the EU?</em> By together addressing barriers to adoption and <strong>exploring actionable priorities</strong>, which also include ethics and sustainability, the session seeks to contribute to the <strong>transformation of the ongoing discussions</strong> between the OSS community, industry stakeholders, EU policymakers, and end-users. </p>\n<h4>Expected results:</h4>\n<p>Through insights gathered from this <strong>co-creation session</strong>, the workshop aims to contribute to exchanges with the European Commission’s Units dealing with the European digital ecosystem, providing <strong>grassroots perspectives that reflect the real needs of OSS users and contributors</strong>. The outputs will feed into the work carried out by <a href=\"https://martel-innovate.com\">Martel Innovate</a> and <a href=\"https://digital4planet.org\">Digital for Planet</a> on <strong>EU-funded cooperation projects</strong> in shaping policy roadmaps. They will directly inform projects like <a href=\"https://open-verse.eu\">OpenVerse</a>, <a href=\"https://nexusforum.eu/\">NexusForum.EU</a>, and <a href=\"https://commons.ngi.eu\">NGI Commons</a>, which aim to bridge the European digital ecosystem and communities with European Commission priorities.</p>\n<h4>Structure:</h4>\n<p>We will work in groups to first identify the main challenges hindering the adoption of OSS, and then to come up with a list of proposed key priorities to support the spread and uptake of OSS solutions in both private and public sectors. </p>\n<p><strong>We propose to structure the session as follows:</strong>\n1. <strong>Short introduction</strong> providing context and outlining expected outcomes of the session (2 mins)\n2. <strong>Interactive session:</strong> each participant will be asked to provide input on a few questions framing the OSS adoption issues, and looking at both potential benefits for users and factors limiting adoption. Questions will also touch upon sustainability aspects (including environmental, social, and economic sustainability, and looking from both the end-user and the OSS contributors perspective). (20 mins)\n3. <strong>Group work:</strong> participants will brainstorm in four groups and come up with a list of points which they think are strategic to foster the uptake of OSS solutions in both the private and public sectors. (20 mins)\n4. <strong>Policy pitch and wrap up:</strong> a person from each group will have two minutes to pitch the policy priorities they identified. (8 mins)\n5. All participants will <strong>vote on the set of policy priorities</strong> they consider the most interesting/relevant. This section of the session is meant to gather the temperature of the audience on each of the approaches proposed. (10 mins max)</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>The sharing of public key information is central to the digital credential security model, but the existing Web PKI with its opaque Certification Authorities and synthetic attestations serves a very different purpose. We propose a new approach to decentralised public key infrastructure, designed for digital identity, in which connections between legal entities that are represented digitally correspond to genuine, pre-existing relationships between recognisable institutions. In this scenario, users can judge for themselves the level of trust they are willing to place in a given chain of attestations. Our proposal includes a novel mechanism for establishing a root of trust in a decentralised setting via independently-verifiable timestamping. We also present an open source reference implementation built on open networks, protocols and standards. The system has minimal setup costs and is freely available for any community to adopt as a digital public good.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Collaboration on public sector Open Source Software (OSS) projects is steadily increasing along with demands for sovereign and interoperable technology stacks. Still, the practice has yet to catch up compared to industry and the broader OSS ecosystem, whose ways of working need to be tailored to manage the many challenges and restraints falling on the public sector. Examples we've come across include the dependency on sourcing of technical expertise, rigorous public procurement frameworks, risk-aversive and self-centric culture, and limited forums for collaboration. </p>\n<p>To help accelerate the public sector's use and development of OSS, we therefore investigated six successful cases of public sector OSS projects from different countries and levels of government. In this talk, we will provide insights on how development is commonly concentrated and performed with the use of national and local service providers. We will talk about different funding models, either involving one or a few central actors, or a wider set through different setups of crowd-funding. We will further elaborate on sustainability challenges related to the various ways of working, and potential approaches to addressing these proactively. </p>\n<p>Attendees will walk away with concrete and live examples to reference, as well as insights on how their organizations can start to engage and collaborate on new and existing public sector OSS projects. The presentation will further help to provide framing and input to other presentations within the devroom and hallway talks, stimulating knowledge sharing and growing a community of practice.</p>",

Open-source software is a great way to achieve this sovereignty. However the fact that a lot of the collaboration happens cross-organisation is most of the time overlooked, with discussions falling back to email. However the boundaries of an organisation should not limit modern collaboration! But how do you solve the political problem of “shall we chat on your platform or mine?”, in particular in a cross-country context. Open standards, like <a href=\"https://matrix.org\">Matrix</a> are the key here, from simplifying the user experience via OIDC login, to the true sovereignty of owning your share of your conversations’ data.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Launched by the Barcelona City Council in 2016, the Decidim Barcelona project was initially created to coordinate the Municipal Action Plan, a participatory initiative aimed at strategically planning the city's projects for the next four years. In its early stages, Decidim was managed directly by the City Council, but over time, it became clear that an independent entity was needed to ensure the project's sustainability and facilitate its adoption and reuse by other governments.</p>\n<p>To address this, the Decidim Association was established on February 16, 2019, during an extraordinary assembly. It was created as the governance body for the Decidim community, with the City Council transferring the management and maintenance of the source code to the Association through a formal agreement.</p>\n<p>This public-common collaboration is an example of how to design the governance of digital commons. It is a unique example in the world of how to implement free software as a public policy with a community governance model.</p>\n<p>In this session, we will explore how the Decidim Association collaborates with governments worldwide, focusing on three key aspects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Technological Governance</strong>: Defining the roadmap and identifying needs.</li>\n<li><strong>Reuse and Adaptation of the Framework</strong>: Tailoring Decidim for diverse governmental contexts.</li>\n<li><strong>Challenges and Lessons Learned</strong>: Insights from working with governments globally.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This talk is ideal for those interested in learning how public organizations can develop FLOSS solutions and the best practices for implementing them with a community governance model.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>WireGuard is a great protocol to set up a virtual private network (VPN). However, the challenge is to make it work on networks that block or mangle user datagram protocol (UDP) traffic. Certain hotspots, such as those at hotels, events, cafes &amp; restaurants block UDP traffic and only allow web traffic over the transmission control protocol (TCP) usually port 80/443. Even if a network allows UDP traffic, there can be issues with certain packets not going through due to issues regarding maximum transmission units (MTU).</p>\n<p>Supporting TCP is left explicitly out of scope for the WireGuard project and should be handled by an upper layer obfuscation tool [1]. There is a good reason for this: TCP-over-TCP has bad performance (e.g. website traffic over a TCP VPN). However, in these networks the choice has to be made between no VPN connectivity or at least something as a fallback. For this reason, there are some tools which aim to proxy UDP packets over TCP.</p>\n<p>Many of these tools, however, do not directly allow you to put it behind a reverse proxy. The advantage of using a reverse proxy is that you can use your existing web server to (next to tunneling it over TCP) obfuscate the traffic with TLS and tunnel your WireGuard traffic through the same port that is serving normal websites. In this talk, I will introduce a tool called ProxyGuard which aims to solve this use case. I explain why I came up with this approach in the first place, what challenges I had implementing it and possible improvements for the future.

A middle-box gives you visibility into your network: latency, jitter and bufferbloat only become apparent when you look. Spot congestion and latency spikes at every level of the network. A middle-box gives you proactive monitoring: identify the customers who are having problems before they call you. And most importantly, a middle-box gets rid of support calls. By actively managing bufferbloat, enhancing perceived latency and proactively pacing packets you can immediately improve your customers’ quality of experience. In our experience, this massively reduces the volume of support calls-and costs to service them. A Quality of Experience middle-box allows also for more aggressive but safer over-subscription rate.

However, Source Load Balancing (balance-slb) is only supported by OpenvSwitch. SLB bonding allows load balancing without remote switch's knowledge or cooperation. SLB assigns each source MAC+VLAN pair to a link and transmits all packets from that MAC+VLAN through that link. Now this is also available on kernelspace by a combination of nftables rules and kernel bonding configuration, all automated through NetworkManager balance-slb option.</p>\n<p>On this talk, we will explore how SLB balancing works and how it was implemented by using nftables and kernel bond driver.

Juggling with public cloud resources such as AWS or GKE is a second nature for you. But here's the thing: you realized that your bill would be much smaller over time if you could run your workflows on your own hardware. Maybe you even have requirements for low latency that can't be addressed by external providers. Say you've bought your commodity switches, new servers, perhaps some GPUs. It's great! But now... what? How, exactly, do you turn these into a cloud infrastructure similar to what you'd get from the large providers?</p>\n<p>Time to turn to the <a href=\"https://docs.githedgehog.com\">Open Network Fabric</a>. This is an open-source, vendor-agnostic project, that aims at bringing the user experience from public cloud providers to private environment. It provides tooling and automation around SONiC, an open-source network operating system based on Linux that runs on switches. The Open Network Fabric is built around the concept of Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) and provides a multi-tenant API to define the user intent on network isolation and connectivity, which is automatically transformed into configuration for switches and software appliances. It also leverages the Kubernetes APIs: all user-facing APIs are Kubernetes Custom Resources (CRDs), so one can use standard Kubernetes tools to manage resources such as VPCs, network attachments, and even switches and servers.</p>\n<p>This talk is an introduction to the Open Network Fabric, with a high overview of the different components and on how to use it to set up a VPC. After presenting the current state of the project, we'll also take a look at a few roadmap items for the associated DPDK-based Gateway, currently at an early stage of development.</p>\n<p>Bring back the Cloud to your home (or lab): compute on the edge, connect your endpoints and VPCs with the Open Network Fabric. And if you feel like it, join the project!</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Cloud workloads need to comply with your organisation's security policies. Joining them to an identity management domain can help with that, and automatically joining them is even better. Learn how the Podengo project enables automatic and secure enrollment of VMs into a FreeIPA domain. </p>\n<p>FreeIPA is an open source identity management solution providing authentication, access control, and other security features for Linux machines, to help organisations meet their security and compliance objectives. These objectives persist when running workloads on public clouds. But the typical workflow of using SSH keys to access the machine may struggle to meet them.</p>\n<p>Enter Podengo. The Podengo service registers your FreeIPA deployment (which could be on-premises), authenticates cloud VMs, and facilitates an automatic and secure domain enrollment. This presentation will explain how the protocol works, what is required to use it, and how we use the Podengo service to provide the Domain Join feature in Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console (and how you could use it in other settings).</p>\n<p>After covering the fundamentals and current use cases, we will discuss some of the feature gaps (and how to close them), and how we could add support for more identity management solutions.</p>\n<p>This presentation could be particularly useful for system and cloud administrators, infosec people, and the cryptography-curious.</p>\n<p>PS: There will be recorded demos available due to time constraints!</p>\n<p>References:</p>\n<p>https://www.freeipa.org/\nhttps://github.com/podengo-project</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Modern web applications strongly rely on Authentication/Authorization infrastructures. To address these needs, the OSS community has strongly endorsed open protocols such as OpenIdConnect and OAuth2, on top of JSON and REST. In turn, these protocols have been implemented in software products such as Keycloak or Lemonldap.</p>\n<p>OpenIdConnect and OAuth2 are authorization protocols, closely aligned with authentication, as provided by Identity Providers.  They have been designed within various standardization bodies such as the OpenId foundation or the Internet Engineering Task Force. Understanding these standards is demanding, but needed in order to implement feature-rich solutions, to understand the various options offered to implementers.</p>\n<p>This talk will therefore discuss in details OIDC and OAuth : the various flows that exist in order to obtain access tokens for standard web apps as for single page applications, the various features that exist to support the needs of mobile devices, in order to address real-world uses cases.</p>",

With FreeIPA’s integrated ACME protocol support, you can automate certificate issuance and renewal, simplifying your security workflows while maintaining enterprise-grade reliability.</p>\n<p>In this session, we’ll explore how FreeIPA ACME capabilities can streamline certificate management across diverse environments. From Kubernetes to traditional systems, FreeIPA’s ACME integration empowers organizations to enhance security, reduce manual effort, and ensure uptime. As a practical example, we’ll demonstrate how Kubernetes’ cert-manager Operator can leverage FreeIPA’s ACME capabilities to manage certificates for containerized applications. This is just one of many possible integrations enabled by FreeIPA’s robust feature set.</p>\n<p>The ACME protocol allows automated interactions between certificate authorities and your servers so you can automate the deployment of your public key infrastructure at a low cost, with relatively little effort. ACME protocol combined with the new features incorporated in the last release of mod_md make it so easy to have a completely automated environment to manage the renewal of the certificates of your webservers. Using the ACME feature of FreeIPA integrated with mod_md you can manage multiple security sites in a  completely automated and scalable way without any external dependencies so you will never need to be concerned about common topics such as: when to perform the operation, possible disruptions, long times waiting for the CA to sign your certificates or any kind of problems you experienced in the past. Mod_md also includes several fine tuning mechanisms about when to perform the operations to make the server aware of any issue in your certs.  We will also review them and this combined with appropriate monitoring reduces the renewal operation to the minimum.</p>\n<p>Whether you manage Kubernetes, hybrid infrastructure, or standalone systems, FreeIPA offers a flexible and scalable approach to SSL/TLS management. Join us to uncover how FreeIPA’s ACME support can transform your certificate lifecycle management, improving security posture with minimal complexity no matter your applications are running on top of Kubernetes or on Apache. Don’t miss the opportunity to master certificate automation with FreeIPA!</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>FreeIPA and SSSD teams are  working on making independent FreeIPA deployments to interoperate. This talk outlines the progress made toward achieving IPA-IPA trust, a feature that mirrors existing integration with Active Directory (AD) but adapts to modern, self-sufficient deployments that may not rely on traditional AD infrastructure.</p>\n<p>IPA-IPA trust leverages Kerberos cross-realm authentication to establish secure relationships between distinct FreeIPA domains and allows seamless access to resources across trusted environments. Building on existing support for AD trusts, the approach reuses proven mechanisms in <a href=\"https://github.com/freeipa/freeipa\">FreeIPA</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/SSSD/sssd\">SSSD</a> to resolve identities, enforce access policies, and manage trusted domain configurations. This includes adapting Kerberos authorization data extensions to securely exchange identity details and group membership information, which FreeIPA already utilizes for AD trusts.</p>\n<p>Key developments include enhancing SSSD to support multiple subdomain types, enabling it to handle IPA-specific identity structures, and introducing new mechanisms to facilitate identity information retrieval across trusted IPA domains. Initial experiments demonstrate the viability of this approach, with prototypes and Fedora-based builds available for testing. </p>\n<p>This talk highlights the technical challenges, solutions, and <a href=\"https://vda.li/posts/2024/05/31/ipa-ipa-trust-progress/\">progress achieved</a> so far, offering insights into the collaborative efforts that aim to extend FreeIPA’s trust capabilities.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Short abstract\nUnderstanding table-level locks in Postgres is a quite useful skill as almost all DDL operations require acquiring one of the different types of table-level locks on the object being manipulated. If not managed well, schema changes can result in downtime. In this talk we will explain fundamentals of table-level locking, covering how different types of locks are applied and queued during schema changes. Attendees will learn how to identify and manage lock conflicts to minimize downtime, avoid deadlocks, and maintain smooth database operations, even during high-concurrency schema changes.</p>\n<p>Long abstract\nIn PostgreSQL, managing schema changes without downtime can be a challenging task. Table-level locks, which control access during Data Definition Language (DDL) operations like ALTER or DROP TABLE, can result in unintended application slowdowns or even service interruptions when not fully understood. This talk will provide a comprehensive dive into table-level locking and lock queueing in PostgreSQL, helping attendees gain the insights they need to perform efficient schema changes.</p>\n<p>We’ll start by explaining the various types of table-level locks in PostgreSQL such as Access Share, Exclusive, and Access Exclusive and how they are automatically managed during common DDL operations. Then, we’ll break down lock queuing: how PostgreSQL organizes lock requests, what happens when transactions wait for locks, and how deadlocks can arise in complex environments.</p>\n<p>Next, we’ll focus on practical approaches to managing table-level locks for near-zero downtime. Attendees will learn techniques to minimize locking impact, including understanding lock conflicts, using online schema migration patterns, and identifying lock-heavy queries. We’ll introduce open-source tools like pgroll, which utilizes the expand/contract pattern to make schema changes in small, lock-free steps.</p>\n<p>By the end of this session, attendees will be equipped with practical strategies and knowledge to control lock behavior during schema changes, ensuring data integrity and reducing operational disruptions. This talk will provide the tools needed to manage PostgreSQL schema changes with confidence and minimal impact on production environments.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>With the increased use of small robots in human households like vacuum robots the next logical step is the introduction of more complex robots which are capable of manipulating objects. Introducing such robots into human household poses a multitude of new challenges, they need to operate in dynamically changing environments while being aware of their surrounding to avoid accidents. Furthermore, they need to be able to reason about the outcome of actions and change their behavior accordingly, to name a few. \nPyCRAM is a framework to design high-level cognition enabled robot behavior, designed to address the aforementioned challenges of deploying robots in human households. This is done by providing tools to define a robot control plan, which is written as high-level human instructions like \"go to the table\" or \"pick up the cup\". PyCRAM is then able to translate these instructions to instructions for a robot while taking the current context the robot is operating in into account. Resulting in robot behavior which is constantly adapting to the current state of the environment and context.</p>\n<p>You can find the framework on GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/cram2/pycram\">PyCRAM</a></p>",

From packages only being available in one specific ROS version, to dependencies which don’t compile on your specific linux version, some problems already start when trying to install your software. But that is just the start for the hobby-roboticist. The flexibility of ROS theoretically allows for cheap robots to be built, but in practice it’s hard to get your odometry, mapping, and movements in general set up correctly if you don’t have any of the more standard supported platforms. \nNot only is this talk a cry for help, it also shines light on why we have not democratised the field of robotics yet.</p>",

Much of the existing tooling is being rewritten in Rust, and Kornia-rs is no exception. It is a fresh port of the popular Kornia library in Pytorch, initially created as an alternative to OpenCV for performing image geometric transformations within the Pytorch community and now supported by other frameworks such as Numpy, TensorFlow, and Jax.</p>\n<p>During the session, we'll explore the history and evolution of the library where we will cover some of the basics, and showcase how Kornia-rs can be seamlessly integrated with existing tools like Rerun or Zenoh to build efficient data pipeline applications for Robotics.</p>\n<p>Link to the project: https://github.com/kornia/kornia-rs</p>",

By eliminating the need for expensive or inaccessible hardware, simulation empowers developers everywhere to create, refine, and scale their robotics applications.</p>\n<p>This talk explores how open-source general-purpose simulators (like Gazebo, Webots, O3de, etc.) are breaking barriers in robotics development. From reducing costs and improving safety to accelerating development cycles and enabling large-scale testing, simulations are revolutionizing the field. Importantly, they are fostering inclusivity by providing accessible tools for regions with limited access to robotics hardware, such as Argentina and other less than well-resourced areas.</p>\n<p>We’ll discuss the critical factors to consider when choosing a simulator, including its focus, community support, and compatibility with open-source tools.

Previously, the sheer size of LLMs, requiring massive GPUs and RAM, made local deployment impossible for most developers. This reliance on cloud services limited experimentation, customization, and affordability.</p>\n<p>My presentation focuses on Llama.cpp, an inference engine enabling efficient execution of LLMs, including Meta's Llama, Qwen, and Mistral models, on CPUs. </p>\n<p>I detail the process of acquiring, building, and quantizing models for local use, showcasing how Ruby bindings and a built-in HTTP server simplify interaction.  I also introduce two open-source tools I've created: Llamagator and Rspec-Llama. </p>\n<p>Llamagator is a Rails application, streamlines the management, testing, and comparison of various LLMs, both local and cloud-based. With it, you can create prompts, define assertions, and evaluate model performance and easily implement pattern of LLM-as-a-judge.</p>\n<p>Rspec-Llama extends Rspec with a specialized DSL for interacting with and validating responses from LLMs, making it easier than ever to integrate these models into testing workflows. These tools, combined with the ability to run LLMs locally, empower developers to explore AI's potential without relying on external providers.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Meta Hacker Cup (formerly known as Facebook Hacker Cup) is an annual international programming competition hosted and administered by Meta. A lot of diverse participants take part in the competition from different countries worldwide. This year however they did allow the usage of AI within the competition, designed to assess the capabilities of Generative AI in performing autonomous code generation tasks. </p>\n<p>The competition featured an AI vs human battle i.e Gen AI or AGIs could be utilised within the coding sphere to see how they rank alongside humans.</p>\n<p>We developed a model designed for fully autonomous coding. It works by combining outputs from multiple LLMs to solve coding problems without human input. The model breaks tasks into smaller parts, assigns them to the best-suited LLM, and refines the outputs. It evaluates solutions through automated testing and improves by learning from feedback. The system uses a voting mechanism to choose the best output and runs checks for errors and performance issues. Test cases provided by the problems in hacker cup are also generated based on the problem statement and are made to run against the generated code to check for the accuracy.</p>\n<p>This model was a top-10  finalist in Meta's Hacker Cup AI track. It demonstrates a new way of using LLMs to perform end-to-end coding tasks. We will share insights from building and testing the model, including its strengths and challenges. We believe that this can be highly useful for students who don't have the privilege of learning competitive coding by paying high fees to institutions or online learning bootcamps but want an environment and a teacher (in form of AI) which enables them to think more on the logic behind the problems fostering more creativity and less sticking and adhering to guidelines which is a norm still practiced in academia.</p>",

Scaling your solution as your team grows.\n  2.  Supporting models beyond LLMs, such as using diffusion models for role-playing applications, TTS models for NotebookLM equivalents, rerankers and embeddings for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and more.</p>\n<p>Today, both models and inference engines are highly diverse and rapidly evolving, while GPU resources remain fragmented and heterogeneous.

There can be x64 cores running in the same address space, cooperating through atomic instructions. </p>\n<p>Said abstraction is built on open source software. The ISA is documented. The driver is in your linux kernel already. Upstream LLVM knows how to emit machine code for the chip.

    "abstract": "<p>It the recent year, generative AI models have come to dominate the discourse around artificial intelligence and machine learning. Both Large Language Models and other generative models for image/video/sound use huge deep learning models, running on expensive and energy intensive GPUs. However there are several other application areas of machine learning, operating under other contraints. One of these is the area of \"TinyML\", where machine learning is used to analyze sensor data on microcontroller-grade systems. A typical TinyML system is under 1 watt, under 1 MB of RAM and FLASH and under 10 USD bill-of-materials.</p>\n<p>emlearn is an open-source project started in 2018, which provides machine learning inference implementations for microcontrollers. It is written in portable C99 code, and supports models trained with scikit-learn and Tensorflow/Keras. Since 2023 the emlearn project also provides bindings for MicroPython, a Python for microcontrollers.</p>\n<p>In this talk we will talk about machine learning on microcontrollers; the applications, developments in the field over the last years, and current trends - both on software and hardware side. This niche of machine learning is extremely concerned with computational efficiency, and we believe that these perspectives may be useful also to developers working in different areas.</p>",

We already demoed a prototype in action at KVM Forum [4]. In this talk, we will briefly describe our motivation for this work for the benefit of those not present in the KVM Forum. Then, we will argue how signed UKIs can be a simple, easier and guest OS agnostic means of deploying the trusted and measured firmware images for tenants in the cloud. We will also describe how UKIs can trigger an update of the firmware using our proposed simple hypervisor interface. Discussions around implementing this have already started within the systemd community [2][5]. We will describe some of the details around our design decisions. We will also seek inputs from the community on implementing the hypervisor specific support needed in UKI for interacting with the hypervisor by proposing some initial ideas.</p>\n<p>This talk is mostly UKI/systemd focussed.

In particular, I'd like to discuss the following parts: why/how can we trust \nthe hardware, the firmware, the bootloader, the kernel, and the userspace; how we can ensure confidentiality and integrity of the workload.\nThe talk is supposed to be fairly high level with the main purpose to provide an overview of the current state of affairs; highlight parts of the chain where the required solutions are already there, parts, which are 'work and progress', and parts where we've just scratched the surface.</p>",

In this presentation, we introduce two tools to check whether a VirtIO device conforms to the specification. Firstly, we present Kani - a tool developed by Amazon that is used to verify conformance in devices implemented in Firecracker. Secondly, we discuss an experimental tool that validates conformance during the execution of the device. This is a Rust tracer that developers can add to an existing device to ensure its implementation conforms to the specification. Traces are compared with the specification at runtime to detect any violations that may have occurred.</p>",

So this talk may be an interesting opportunity for discussion to influence the future development of your preferred virtualization solution.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>KubeVirt is transforming the integration of containers and virtual machines (VMs) within Kubernetes environments. By enabling VMs to run as processes in Kubernetes pods, KubeVirt allows seamless operation of VMs alongside containerized workloads. However, the existing Kubernetes networking model, while offering simplicity and cost-effectiveness through a unified approach, presents challenges for diverse user groups.</p>\n<p>Traditional virtualization users face difficulties meeting their Layer 2 isolation needs, while Kubernetes-savvy users seek a managed networking experience. Importantly, both groups running virtualization workloads require stable IP addresses for their VMs throughout their lifecycle, including during live migration and restart/shutdown operations. This requirement adds complexity to the already challenging Kubernetes networking landscape, and brings into focus the needs for network isolation in Kubernetes, questioning the fundamental decisions for networking in Kubernetes.</p>\n<p>To address these multifaceted issues, the user-defined networks OVN-Kubernetes feature has emerged as a powerful solution. This feature integrates natively with the Kubernetes API, supporting services and network policies while providing the necessary tools for effective traffic isolation and NATed egress implementation. Crucially, it also offers the capability to maintain consistent IP addresses for virtualization workloads, ensuring stability during VM lifecycle events.</p>\n<p>Through a live demonstration, attendees will learn practical steps to implement traffic isolation using OVN-Kubernetes User Defined Networking functionality. Including NATed egress and stable IP addressing for VMs on their clusters. By the session's end, participants will understand how to tailor Kubernetes networking to meet their organization's specific requirements, bridging the gap between Kubernetes' flexible architecture and the stringent networking needs of both traditional virtualization and managed Kubernetes environments. This knowledge will empower attendees to create more effective and secure networking solutions, enabling them to fully leverage cloud-native technologies while maintaining operational security and compliance across diverse deployment scenarios.</p>",

This benefits customers by allowing them to choose services that best meet their needs, while also benefiting providers by expanding their potential customer base. However, significant barriers currently hinder this flexibility, including high costs for data egress, lengthy switching procedures, and a lack of interoperability between providers, which can lead to the loss of data and applications.</p>\n<p>The Data Act, coming into force on 12 September 2025, aims to address these challenges by ensuring that switching between providers is free, fast, and seamless. This presentation will describe and demonstrate a new open-source virtualization layer developed within the IPCEI-CIS project to further facilitate smooth transitions between data processing services.</p>\n<p>This integrated virtualization system ensures interoperability by providing a control plane that manages distributed resources, virtual machines, and Kubernetes clusters across multiple cloud providers. It also guarantees portability, enabling applications to run seamlessly on any provider without the need for conversion. Additionally, it supports efficient migration of applications between providers with minimal downtime.</p>\n<p>The demo will showcase a testbed combining resources from six EU cloud providers and resources from U.S. providers to illustrate the migration of workloads. This initiative demonstrates how the new virtualization layer enables true flexibility and portability in the cloud ecosystem, driving the vision of a competitive and interoperable cloud market in Europe.</p>",

SEV is an extension of AMD-V technology and allows to run encrypted virtual machines on the top of “untrusted” hypervisor. Even though the hypervisor still controls the lifecycle of virtual machines, it’s up to SEV enabled guest to decide whether its memory is encrypted or not. The SEV enabled hardware ensures that the hypervisor nor other software (VMs) running on the platform can’t access (decrypt) this memory. \nIn the heart of the SEV technology is the “AMD Secure Processor” hardware component which offers an interface to the system software (hypervisor or guest kernels) allowing to manage virtual machines and the whole platform, so these pieces of software can run and communicate without compromising each other’s security.  X86 instruction set was also enriched to fully benefit from SEV technology.\nWe will present our project which targets to integrate SEV extension to Xen hypervisor, the necessary developments and adaptions that have been done, where we are with this project and our future work.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>dm-verity is a mechanism of the Linux kernel that allows for transparent integrity checking of data as they are read from block devices. It works by pre-generating a merkle tree of hashes for the target/data block device and then by supplying the root hash to the kernel during the mount operation. This enables a form of integrity checking which is \"delayed\" in the sense that checks are done by the kernel using the merkle tree and the root hash during individual block accesses, instead of having to hash and verify the entire block device before mounting; which is prohibited in some use cases (i.e during boot).</p>\n<p>Snaps are mostly well-known as a packaging and distribution format for Linux applications but are also used in Ubuntu Core, which is Ubuntu's immutable OS variant, to ship core parts of the system such as the Linux kernel or the rootfs. Storage-wise, each snap is essentially a squashfs read-only file system which is mounted during its installation. While checks are already in place for verifying the integrity of snaps in use, we are looking into improving the existing mechanisms by allowing snaps to be mounted with dm-verity. This should allow for more performant integrity checking prior to use (or during boot in the case of Ubuntu Core) as well as continuous integrity checking during runtime. This talk will present some of our design challenges, a few interesting applications (i.e in secure boot and confidential computing) and the current state of the project.</p>",

It even permits to use immutable rootfs images that can be updated in A/B fashion atomically. But all these pieces are neither plugged together by its official installer nor would that help when you need offline-built and signed images.</p>\n<p>The Civil Infrastructure Platform project (https://www.cip-project.org) aims at closing this gap, specifically for Debian use cases in the embedded industrial field, although results are not limited to that. This talk introduces the integration layer isar-cip-core (https://gitlab.com/cip-project/cip-core/isar-cip-core) that the project created, presents its current key features and next plans. It looks back on how some custom packages that used to be generated ad-hoc became regular Debian packages. Furthermore, it explains how (most) generated images were made bit-identically reproducible.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>As containers continue to reshape how applications are deployed and managed, bootable containers have emerged as the next frontier—extending cloud-native concepts down to the operating system itself. In this talk, we’ll introduce Bootc and explore how it powers image-based OS deployment, boot integrity, and manageability. By leveraging Bootc, the operating system becomes as portable and manageable as a containerized app, bridging traditional OS management with modern DevOps practices.</p>\n<p>We’ll cover \"Image Mode\" for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Fedora, an approach that allows developers, operations teams, and solution providers to manage the entire OS as a container image. Image Mode incorporates the bootc CLI, the main command-line tool for managing updates and other tasks on end devices, along with the bootc-image-builder, which can generate a variety of image types. These include disk images (such as ISOs) suitable for disconnected installations, and virtual disk image formats like QEMU Copy-On-Write (QCOW2), Amazon Machine Images (AMI), and Virtual Machine Images (VMI). This method not only reduces complexity across environments but also enables a unified DevOps approach, integrating seamlessly with container-native tools and CI/CD pipelines. Attendees will learn how image-based deployments address security needs with containerized scanning, validation, and signing tools, and hear about opportunities for standardization within the container ecosystem to ensure boot and operational integrity at scale.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>The German <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bildschirmtext\">Bildschirmtext</a> system was an early large-scale public access information service established in 1983.  Using telephone connections, users would dial in to a central system which offered them with access to commercial and non-commercial offerings.  Television sets were used as display devices, with a set top box or built-in decoder proving the terminal functionality.  Communication was bi-directional with a low-speed back channel that allowed typing in text messages.</p>\n<p>The introduction of Bildschirmtext overlapped with the home computing era, but for regulatory reasons, home computers could not easily be used as Bildschirmtext terminals.  This, among other technical and non-technical reasons, caused the service to fail to reach its full potential.  It remained in use as a carrier system for home banking and other high security applications until it was finally switched off in 2007.</p>\n<p>As Bildschirmtext was a centralized system operated by the federal Deutsche Bundespost on mainframe systems, much of the content that was available has been lost.  A couple of the original data files of the Chaos Computer Club have survived, however, and as the CCC became notorious in the context of Bildschirmtext, that content made for an entertaining exercise in re-engineering.</p>\n<p>In the talk, I will present my journey as a recent Bildschirmtext enthusiast. I will describe how the service was organized, how content providers edited content and put it into the system and how users would access it.  I will also dive into my implementation of a Bildschirmtext terminal emulator in Javascript and a central service system written in Common Lisp, providing the audience with an insight of the challenges, constraints and possibilities of the system.</p>",

The analysis covers motion detection methods, the way signals are transmitted to the computer, ergonomics, and ways to test the device with a modern computer. The pre-commercial phase is covered, which includes early marine radar trackballs, Douglas Engelbart's wheel mouse, and Rollkugel ball mouse. The commercial phase is tracked through the following personally studied devices, including early Xerox mice with mechanical and optical encoders, Mouse Systems' design with a simplified optical encoder and reflective mouse pad, Depraz and Apple mice that commercialized the optomechanical encoder, the returns to  Engelbart's original approaches in 1980s analog mice for home computers and wheel mice such as Torrington/Numonics Manager mouse and Hawley DEC mouse, and, finally, the ProAgio Scroll mouse that started the wheel scrolling revolution. Considered connection methods include parallel, serial, serial bus, and analog ones. Surprisingly, all mice and trackballs covered in the talk can be connected to modern computers using open-source converters, which are also examined and discussed.</p>",

But these modern tools are specialised, and not always general enough to be packaged with every distribution. Or if they are available today, will they tomorrow?

We focus on creating engaging, interactive exhibits that highlight vintage hardware and software, offering hands-on experiences to captivate visitors of all ages.\nOne of our signature events, Electric Dreams, is an annual gathering for members, supporters, and enthusiasts. In its first four editions, the event centered on the restoration of a General Electric GE-120, a historic computer that represents one of the early successors to Olivetti’s groundbreaking ELEA 9000 series—the first solid-state transistor-based computer in history.</p>\n<p>The computer was used at the Zurich Airport until its decommissioning in 1984. This machine played a key role in early aviation systems and its restoration offers a window into the technological evolution of the 20th century.</p>\n<p>Thanks to the fact that the donor preserved the original manuals—written in four languages, and partially hand written—  our archival team has fully digitalized 57 binders worth of documentation. Meanwhile, the restoration team has focused on following the original testing procedures to validate the components of the CPU.</p>\n<p>Reconstructing the self-test rig has been a critical milestone, enabling efficient identification and replacement of all the parts that tested as defective.</p>\n<p>To complement this effort, we are also developing a full emulator for the GE-120, creating a bridge between its historical operation and modern exploration.\nThis talk will trace the journey of the restoration project, detailing achievements to date and setting the stage for the future.</p>\n<p>With a look ahead to Electric Dreams 2025, usually occurring during the last weekend of July, we invite the audience to join us in sunny Calabria for a hands-on experience with this exciting challenge.</p>\n<p>https://github.com/MusIF-MIAI/ge-120-test-rig/</p>",

In this talk, we present a novel approach to optimizing resource utilization for interactive GPU workloads using container checkpointing. This approach enables dynamic reallocation of GPU resources based on real-time workload demands, without the need for modifying existing applications. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through experimental evaluations with a variety of interactive GPU workloads and present preliminary results that highlight its potential.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>We present DynaModERA, an open-source Python package to perform Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) at scale on the publicly available ERA5 dataset, the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate covering the period from January 1940 to present. DMD is a popular technique for data-driven modeling of a variety of dynamical systems due to its simplicity and interpretability. In contrast to state-of-the-art deep learning models for data-driven weather prediction, such as those developed by NVIDIA, Huawei and Google DeepMind, DMD is a computationally inexpensive algorithm that provides a best-fit, linear characterization of a non-linear dynamical system, and generates explainable and interpretable results in the form of spatial modes with temporal evolution. These modes often have physical meaning that align with the underlying physics of the problem.</p>\n<p>A common limitation of DMD is its inability to handle large datasets. DynaModERA addresses this challenge by enabling DMD on big weather data through the generation of low-rank approximations of ERA5 and the construction of smaller DMD models for different temporal subsamples. These models are then combined into a unified framework, allowing for stable predictions across all time scales. DynaModERA also provides a comprehensive pipeline for the entire process, including downloading appropriate ERA5 slices from the cloud, data versioning and tracking using Data Version Control (https://dvc.org/) , producing low-rank approximations at scale, and generating DMD models and predictions. By applying DMD to extensive portions of the ERA5 dataset, DynaModERA not only establishes a benchmark for comparing more advanced data-driven weather prediction models but also provides valuable physical insights through DMD modes, which can be used as input features for deep learning models.</p>",

The talk summarizes the different compilers that AMD provides to address the confusion and point users to the correct compiler for their application. Since programming environments are not complete without libraries, the talk also showcases available libraries, such as rocBLAS. The talk provides a high-level overview together with examples on how to use the different approaches.</p>\n<p>First, it covers some fundamentals of GPU programming and the execution model of HIP. It then shows how to construct an easy HIP kernel from scratch. This is followed by a look at the HIPIFY tool to port codes from CUDA to HIP. Second, the talk covers OpenMP® as GPU programming model in both C++ and Fortran. It highlights the difference between HIP and OpenMP® when it comes to control and convenience. Third, the C++ stdpar capability of ROCm™ is presented to highlight that the user can write pure C++ programs while still benefiting from GPU offload via compiler magic. Lastly, an example is given on how libraries can be used to offload the most relevant computation to the GPU without the need to write GPU kernel code at all.</p>\n<p>All components mentioned in the talk are open-source, with most of the actual compiler work being done in the upstream llvm-project.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>While digitalisation leads to ever growing data collections, exploiting the full potential of these data collections remains a challenge. Relevant data is difficult to find and it's not easy to use either. At the same time making data available such that others can find and (re)use them is cumbersome. For more than a decade various approaches - technical, organisational, cultural - are followed to help improve the situation, yet at best one witnesses isolated solutions and for many research data management remains a hassle. </p>\n<p>Solving challenges of Research Data Management (RDM) requires coordinated efforts of many parties involved. What happens often is that research projects start by writing down a Data Management Plan (DMP), then do their research and at the end struggle making their data publicly available as required by publishers and research funders.</p>\n<p>This talk proposes extensions to EESSI - the European Environment for Scientific Software Installations (pronounced as \"easy\", https://eessi.io) - to help improve research data management. EESSI provides a large software stack of hundreds of software installations that are streamed on-demand to client systems. It combines several FOSS tools including CernVM-FS (https://cernvm.cern.ch/fs/), Gentoo Prefix (https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:Prefix), EasyBuild (https://easybuild.io) and Lmod (https://lmod.readthedocs.io/) to build a service that can be used by anyone on any Linux machine anywhere in the world. A user just needs to install and configure a small client on his/her system and is ready to do science - analysing or generating data - within a few minutes.</p>\n<p>A key building block of EESSI is its compatibility layer which provides system-level tools and libraries for basic functions such as file management, process creation, and so on. The compatibility layer uses Gentoo that is installed under a prefix. For each of the CPU families supported by EESSI - x86_64 and aarch64 (and soon riscv64) - EESSI just needs a single common installation of Gentoo. Because Gentoo is built from sources, extending a few functions in that layer is particularly easy and everyone who uses EESSI would be enabled to use these extensions.</p>\n<p>Extending core functions of EESSI's compatibility layer facilitates the logging of data accesses (which process accesses what data and when) and simplifies access to remote data (data that is not already present where the data processing should happen).</p>\n<p>Logging information about data accesses facilitates the creation of data flow graphs which can be used for optimisation, reproducibility, and in particular to automate the description of how results such as diagrams, tables, other data products were obtained. Detailed descriptions may help others to understand how the data was processed, to apply the processing to new data or to modify the processing to their needs.</p>\n<p>Today, more and more data sets are published and associated with a persistent identifier. Instead of downloading data sets in a separate step and then processing them, the EESSI compatibility layer can be extended such that data sets can be accessed directly via persistent identifiers. While it may seem like a small improvement, this would enrich the logging information. Without any further steps by a researcher the used data sources would be identifiable and they could be cited automatically. Reproducing results would be improved and last but not least those who published the data would be acknowledged more easily.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Cloud and HPC increasingly converge in hardware platform capabilities and specifications, nevertheless still largely differ in the software stack and how it manages available resources. The HPC world typically favors Slurm for job scheduling, whereas Cloud deployments rely on Kubernetes to orchestrate container instances across nodes. Running hybrid workloads is possible by using bridging mechanisms that submit jobs from one environment to the other. However, such solutions require costly data movements, while operating within the constraints set by each setup’s network and access policies. In this work, we explore a design that enables running unmodified Kubernetes workloads directly on HPC. With <a href=\"https://github.com/CARV-ICS-FORTH/HPK\">High-Performance Kubernetes (HPK)</a>, users deploy their own private Kubernetes “mini Clouds”, which internally convert container lifecycle management commands to use the system-level Slurm installation for scheduling and Singularity/Apptainer as the container runtime. We consider this approach to be practical for deployment in HPC centers, as it requires minimal pre-configuration and retains existing resource management and accounting policies. HPK provides users with an effective way to utilize resources by a combination of well-known tools, APIs, and more interactive and user-friendly interfaces as is common practice in the Cloud domain, as well as seamlessly combine Cloud-native tools with HPC jobs in converged, containerized workflows.</p>",

Despite the generated code in most cases being equivalent,\nI observe significant performance differences on the same hardware. I\ncan identify the root causes of most of these differences, many of\nwhich are due to relatively superficial details such as inconsistent\ndefaults regarding compiler optimisation and numerical accuracy,\nalthough a few remain mysterious. The obtained information is useful\nto anyone who seeks to generate low-level GPU code from higher level\nspecifications or libraries.</p>",

Highlighting techniques implemented on modern GPU architectures, we discuss their applicability to scientific computing workloads, including LU factorization and beyond.

    "abstract": "<p>HPC clusters are characterized by powerful hardware and fine-tuned software environments to extract as much performance as possible from the system. Surprisingly, many HPC systems typically use the default kernel provided by its Linux distribution of choice, which is a generic binary built to maximize stability and compatibility and lacks the fine-tuning for performance characteristic of such systems.\nWe explored the impact of different optimization techniques that can be carried out on the Linux kernel without changing its code. We tested compiler optimizations with GCC and LLVM, using CPU instruction sets specific to the target hardware, profile guided optimizations (PGO) or link time optimizations (LTO). The result is that such optimizations on kernel space have limited effects and depend on the type of workload, rendering them difficult to apply on HPC systems with a diverse ecosystem.\nThe main goal is to generate (more) optimized kernel images with the same exact functionality of the distribution kernel used in your system. We specifically target kernels of RPM-based Linux distributions and show how to generate drop-in replacements with the aforementioned optimizations.</p>",

Still, while everybody asks \"what is JavaScript?\" nobody asks \"how is JavaScript?\".</p>\n<p>It might therefore be interesting to dig a bit deeper into this complex and versatile programming language: Where is it going? How has it evolved over the years? How does language design and evolution happen in the first place? What are the rules put in place to ensure that it evolves in the right direction and continue to serve its ever-evolving set of users and other stakeholders?</p>\n<p>Join me in this overview of the TC39 standards committee, its processes and initiatives as we learn just how much work goes into reshaping the most popular programming language for the future.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>The landscape of AI training data stands at a critical crossroads. As large language models increasingly shape our digital ecosystem, the methods of data collection and curation have become a complex battleground of legal, ethical, and technical challenges.</p>\n<p>Concerns from creators have spurred lawsuits and prompted AI companies to limit transparency about training datasets, undermining accountability, innovation, and research. While using open access or public domain data could address these issues, at the time of writing, no large-scale competitive models trained on such data exist yet due to challenges like unreliable metadata, digitization costs, the “consent crisis,” and the need for legal and technical expertise.</p>\n<p>In this talk, we will discuss pioneering community efforts toward creating open and responsible AI training datasets that challenge the current opaque practices of major AI companies and chart a path toward open datasets as part of a larger public AI ecosystem that can address humanity's most pressing needs while distributing control among many stakeholders.</p>\n<p>In June 2024, Mozilla and EleutherAI convened 30 open dataset builders from across the field—organizations such as Hugging Face, Pleias, Cohere4AI, LLM360, TogetherAI, and many more—to address these critical issues. Based on the insights from this gathering, we co-created a research paper titled \"Towards Best Practices for Open Datasets for LLM Training\". This paper outlines the challenges of navigating the production of open datasets and provides practical recommendations for sourcing, processing, governing, and releasing such datasets. These recommendations are rooted in on-the-ground experience and paired with examples of what is already being done. While the paper references OSI's Open Source AI definition, it goes further by outlining possible tiers of openness and offering avenues for more ethical data governance in AI datasets. </p>\n<p>This session will provide an in-depth exploration of the current landscape and its main players, unpacking the legal ambiguities surrounding AI training data and highlighting the critical importance of transparency and governance. We will share a practical roadmap for developing datasets that promote healthy openness, respect people and communities’ broadly defined rights, and advance the field of artificial intelligence from a digital public good perspective, as well as an overview of concrete policy and tech investments that would unlock the ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Building a future where AI systems can be trained on openly licensed data that is responsibly curated and governed requires collaboration across legal, technical, and policy domains, and fostering a culture of openness. With this session, we hope to engage you in a discussion around the unique insights into this cutting-edge work and invite you to add your voice to the growing community of responsible open-source AI developers and advocates.</p>",

Or maybe you are someone who loves Open Source (possibly even contributed to some open source projects) but does not feel like you will ever be able to contribute a project of your own that might interest others. If you connect with one of these three descriptions, I have prepared this talk for you. Even if you do not see yourself in any of those, please keep reading to see if you should consider joining the Python devroom for this talk.</p>\n<p>This talk is divided in three parts:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>What is Nim?</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Why Nim made me a better Pythonista</strong></li>\n<li><strong>How Nim can help you getting more involved in Open Source</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>In the first part I will give a quick introduction to Nim emphasizing similarity and differences with Python. I will explain that Nim can be used as a fast and easy to use complement to Python with a great interoperability and metaprogramming superpowers. Nim has also a powerful type system, functional features and can compile to Javascript.</p>\n<p>In the second part I will tell you a bit about my story on how I got attracted to Nim coming from Python, the benefits of a niche community, and how I came out with a deeper appreciation for the Python project and community.</p>\n<p>In the third part, I will show you how easy it is to create your own open source project with Nim and share it with the world (maybe even a Python version of it), and I will tell you a little bit about my own open source project, called Nimib, a literate programming tool for interactive explanations.</p>\n<p>The talk is kept approachable for beginners while trying to be interesting also for experts. It does not have any specific pre-requisites on Nim, Python or Open Source but a familiarity and interest with at least one of those will help you take the most out of it.</p>",

One source of the difference (reference flag numbering) has been known for a while. But after cleaning that up, we found that there are at least two other ways in which bytecode is irreproducible: one related to reference use (also solved), one related to object order (still unsolved).

    "abstract": "<p>In September 2024, the last modification required to enable PREEMP_RT for the x86, AArch64 and RISC-V architectures was submitted to the main development tree by Thomas Gleixner. Even the previous RT related enhancements brought lot of useful fixes and features for kernel deployment outside the RT area that Linus recognized the community around RT deployment of GNU/Linux as useful and worthy of incorporating its work. The first meeting of the community interested in using GNU/Linux in RT applications took place in Vienna exactly 25 years ago (Real Time Linux Workshop). Another round anniversary is 20 years since kernel list debate following by possible solutions for real-time Linux deployment debate at the Real Time Linux Workshop conference at Lanzhou University in China. The first minor modifications (runtime locking correctness validator) were included in the main development tree by that time. To date, about 10,000 changes have been submitted to the main kernel tree directly by the RT development team and 5,000 changes in the related drivers and subsystems added by their maintainers in response to patch requests and other needs.</p>\n<p>In this lecture, I will present the development history, highlight and gaps learned, testing for automotive communication etc.because I have followed the development from the beginning to allow our applications and projects realization.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>The Linux kernel is a foundational element of the modern IT infrastructure, powering billions of devices from smartphones and routers to desktops and supercomputers. Consequently, the quality of its code affects IT's reliability, resilience, performance, and evolution. Through this presentation I aim to improve our understanding of the Linux kernel's code quality regarding its usage of the C preprocessor: a dated, ubiquitous, and often insidious part of the compilation process. I show the characteristics of the C preprocessor's usage, the introduced technical debt, the usage's evolution, and the feasibility of reducing the incurred technical debt, mainly through refactoring and by utilizing facilities of the Rust programming language.</p>\n<p>As a tool for the analysis I extended the <a href=\"https://www.spinellis.gr/cscout/\">CScout</a> refactoring browser to collect tens of metrics before and after the C preprocessor's execution. I then applied CScout on three versions of Linux spanning two decades, running the oldest kernel analysis on the <a href=\"https://www.qemu.org/\">QEMU emulator</a>  and the newest on the <a href=\"https://doc.aris.grnet.gr/system/hardware/\">ARIS supercomputer</a>, processing in total more than 45 million lines of code.</p>\n<p>I found that the C preprocessor is extensively used, often doubling key code elements seen by the C compiler-proper. The preprocessor's use is associated with several types of technical debt including namespace pollution; scoping, namespace, and control-flow confusion; composite identifiers; hybrid call paths; deep and cyclic include hierarchies; expansion explosions; and structural quality metrics deterioration. Although the density of some preprocessor usages is steady or decreasing over time, some worrisome usages are showing significant increases.</p>\n<p>To explore how this situation can be addressed, I present a taxonomy of non-trivial C preprocessor use cases, which indicates that there two broad categories of changes that can be made. First, most object-like macros can be easily refactored into C <code>const</code> objects or <code>enum</code> values, while about half of the function-like macros could be rewritten as C functions. Although this change is wide in scope the corresponding gains in code maintainability will be small. Second, the remaining non-trivial C preprocessor function-like macros could be refactored; many through specific facilities of Rust that I describe for corresponding macro use cases. In this case however the amount of required engineering effort is large.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>The Linux kernel architecture faces inherent limitations in its security design, primarily due to constraints imposed by the underlying hardware. The Linux kernel must not only isolate user-space processes but also protect itself from unauthorized access—a task made increasingly challenging by the presence of vulnerabilities. Since modern security mechanisms rely on the Linux kernel's integrity, their effectiveness collapses as soon as the kernel is compromised. Therefore, the kernel's resilience is crucial to the security of the entire system, raising the fundamental question: how can we maintain robust security despite the presence of kernel vulnerabilities?</p>\n<p>In this presentation, we introduce a virtualization-assisted security architecture for the Linux kernel to address these challenges. Our solution provides a lightweight virtualization layer comprising a thin, formally-verifiable virtual machine monitor on top of the open-source NOVA microhypervisor. Acting as a security support layer, this architecture enables the Linux kernel to effectively leverage the system's virtualization extensions to fortify its defenses. In-line with virtualization-based state-of-the-art security mechanisms, our solution enforces Linux kernel code integrity and protects selected data structures from being abused by malicious actors. Beyond these capabilities, it enables advanced security features, such as isolating selected security-critical subsystems within the Linux kernel itself and providing a versatile event monitoring facility targeting the activity of applications and containers in user space. Overall, by bridging the traditional separation between the OS and system virtualization technologies, our open source implementation integrates both to create a more robust and resilient security foundation. We present our implementation as a promising approach to mitigating the risks posed by kernel vulnerabilities while significantly enhancing the security posture of modern systems.</p>",

As these bugs had been around and undetected for a long time, I decided to take a stab at it.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>The Linux kernel offers several mechanisms for system call tracing and virtualization, such as ptrace, ptrace with PTRACE_SYSEMU, seccomp with SECCOMP_RET_TRACE, seccomp-unotify, and prctl with PR_SET_SYSCALL_USER_DISPATCH. Each of these methods has unique application domains, strengths, and limitations in terms of complexity and usability, while sharing core capabilities. Although primarily used for building powerful debugging tools (e.g., gdb, strace), these mechanisms can also be leveraged to construct syscall-based virtual machines, achieving varied performance levels and encountering specific challenges.</p>\n<p>A distinctive feature of syscall-based virtual machines is their ability to selectively emulate system calls. For example, one might choose to emulate open(2) but not socket(2), thereby providing the guest environment with a tailored \"view\" of the underlying operating system.</p>\n<p>This seminar will explore the current state of syscall tracing and virtualization techniques through practical demonstrations, examine their inherent limitations, and propose potential improvements to enhance usability and performance. Specific focus will be given to the challenges of virtualizing the poll(2) and select(2) syscall families, which are particularly intricate when managing a mixed environment of virtualized and real file descriptors.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Education typically prepares young people for professional life, equipping them with the skills to meet industry demands. Occasionally, however, the flow is reversed - educational research reshapes the industry itself. Historically, work on educational programming languages has sparked innovations like personal computing, graphical user interfaces, and the object-oriented programming paradigm.</p>\n<p>In recent years, visual programming languages - where scripts are built by snapping together graphical blocks - have become a powerful tool for introducing programming to novices. But could there be more to these blocks than just their use in education? Could they point to a broader, transformative approach to programming itself?</p>\n<p>In this talk, I’ll explore the <em><a href=\"https://snap.berkeley.edu\">Snap!</a></em> visual programming language and showcase its recent developments, where blocks become <em>first-class citizens</em> of the language. By treating blocks as a computational domain, Snap! demonstrates how blocks can surpass their textual counterparts in expressiveness and versatility. This shift may offer new ways to form mental models of computation, potentially laying the groundwork for a new programming paradigm.</p>\n<p>Join me as we examine the exciting possibilities of a block-oriented approach to programming and consider whether this marks the beginning of something much bigger.</p>",

    "url": "https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-4076-foll-e-open-source-educational-tool-to-stimulate-logical-reasoning/",
    "abstract": "<p>FOLL-E is an interactive tool designed to stimulate and sharpen the logical reasoning skills of children ages 8-12. Inspired by languages such as Scratch and Blockly, we have developed a blocks-based interface for pure logic. Crucially, we have proceeded to turn our blocks physical: children are given tangible \"puzzle pieces\" instead of a keyboard and mouse. This physical nature makes the tool more inviting and fun to play with, yet can still express everything we want.</p>\n<p>The setup consists of a camera attached to a Raspberry Pi, which is connected to a computer screen. On the computer screen, children are presented with two groups of three robots each. A logic rule separates both robot groups (e.g., in one, all robots have a green arm, compared to none in the other). The goal is for the children to figure out this rule, and compose it by assembling the \"puzzle pieces\" into the correct configuration representing this rule. The Raspberry Pi then detects the blocks and verifies their correctness using an open-source logic engine. If correct, it continues on to the next level. If incorrect, it explains to the children where they went wrong, so that they can try again. In this sense, FOLL-E is meant to be very interactive.</p>\n<p>From the get-go, we wanted FOLL-E to be freely available to everyone. As such, all aspects of FOLL-E are open source and available online for free, including among others the code and the design plans for the blocks. Furthermore, we are working on a detailed step-by-step building guide, aimed at e.g. schools. In a sense, anyone with access to a laser cutter and a Raspberry Pi can make their own setups -- which we strongly encourage you to do. :-)</p>\n<p>Feel free to check out https://FOLL-E.com for pictures/videos of FOLL-E or https://gitlab.com/Vadevesi/foll-e to take a look at the source code.</p>",

Nowadays, playing a videogame usually means having to renounce your privacy and shake hands with realities that we might not condone if we knew what they conceal. Free software allows us to reject this premise and grants people access to these experiences and the means to create games in ways that do no harm.
