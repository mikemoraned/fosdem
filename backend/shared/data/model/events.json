Stemming from the role of a calculator, the profession of a developer was initially considered a women's job, while hardware design was seen as a man's job. However, who are these women who have shaped the world of tech? Why don't we hear more about them? With Laura Durieux, you'll attempt to set the record straight bit by bit and provide role models in tech that you've always needed.</p>",

It’s also important for individuals to chart their own path that aligns with their unique experience and interest. </p>\n<p>In this panel discussion, panelists will share how they got started in their career and their journey over the past two decades. For people looking for jobs in open source, we’ll discuss what we look for in candidates and why it’s not necessary to check all the boxes in job descriptions. We’ll also discuss challenges in balancing your day jobs vs. open source activities during your career. </p>\n<p>In addition, we’ll also delve into other challenges and opportunities of an open source career that range from dealing with the impostor syndrome, DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) challenges, exploring open source communities for self growth, and more. </p>\n<p>The goal of this session is to help attendees feel more comfortable exploring opportunities in open source and be confident in charting their own path. Our panel members will share what contributed to their success and the lessons learned throughout their extensive experience in open source. This session is meant to be interactive, and we’ll encourage attendees to ask questions and engage in the conversation.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>At FOSDEM 2023 we heard directly from the authors of The Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) and the Product Liability Directive (PLD) about the care they were taking to avoid harm to free and open source software developers. During the year, these legislators received a great deal of help from experts across the communities to make that (even more) true! Now both instruments are in their final state, we can learn lessons how to engage over the next wave.</p>\n<p>In this session we will hear an update from the authors of the legislation on how they see the last year with CRA and PLD, and insights from the open source community members who engaged to change it. We will explore how easy it is to engage with legislators over policy that will affect open source projects, and hopefully have an opportunity for audience feedback. If this session leaves you with questions, or you want to contribute yourself, come to the unique \"policy hackfest\" Devroom on Sunday, \"Open Source In The European Legislative Landscape\".</p>",

In our earliest days, we naïvely thought that the GPL would work like magic pixie dust; we'd sprinkle it on our code, and our code would remain free as in freedom.</p>\n<p>The reality check that we've received over the last 35 years has been painful on this issue.  While this talk will cover the few huge successes in copyleft enforcement that have lead to real improvements to the rights and freedoms of users, we'll also face frankly the compromises made and false paths taken in the earliest days, that have now led to a simple but unfortunate fact: almost every Linux-based device for sale on the market today does <em>not</em> comply with Linux's license (the GPLv2).</p>\n<p>This talk will not only discuss the primary past GPL enforcement efforts around the world, but also provide a whirlwind tour of how copyleft came to work in practice, how we wished it had worked, and discuss ideas, suggestions, and plans for the future strategies in copyleft that, informed by this history, are our best hope for software freedom and rights.</p>\n<p>Have ever wondered how FOSS was <em>actually</em> was supposed <em>stay</em> FOSS for the long term?  Have you ever been unsure or confused why — in a world where Linux is on nearly every device —  most people cannot actually run an alternative OS build on their device?  This talk will leave you informed on these questions and prepared to participate in the next policy steps our community must take to bring back software freedom and rights to the next generation of FOSS users, activists and developers.</p>",

While “security” is a capability of open source since many years, a few years ago using open source in safety critical applications seemed to be impossible even to think about. Nowadays it has become a valid option for upcoming applications. This kind of application that should save lives, or at least not harm anyone. \nHowever, with advancements in technology and safety integrity standards, open source is becoming a valid option for upcoming safety critical applications. This talk will provide an overview of how open source projects approach their integration to safety critical applications. Depending on the expectations of these applications, there are different solutions to address their needs. \nThe talk will introduce example projects such as ELISA, the Zephyr Project, and the Xen Project, which are currently addressing these expectations with various mechanisms and approaches.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Free software users and authors tend to be highly aware of the risks of large-scale collection of personal data, and often consider software telemetry to be incompatible with user privacy. But it is possible to collect anonymous data about how software is used in a way that respects its users and protects them from harm – and by doing so, the software's authors can make better-informed decisions about how to improve it.</p>\n<p>In this presentation, I will make a case for why free software projects should want to collect data on how the software is used, and how this can be done in a privacy-respecting fashion. I will describe the anonymous metrics system in Endless OS, a desktop Linux distribution: our goals for the system, its design and implementation, the types of usage data we collect, and what we have learned from that data, as well as some shortcomings of both the system itself and the data we have.</p>\n<p>I hope to encourage other free software projects, on the desktop or otherwise, to consider adopting similar techniques to better understand how their software is used.</p>",

We will see how to use <strong>Python, JavaScript, and Go</strong> to send messages into Kafka.</p>\n<p>Now, we need an analytics database, and for real-time data, a <strong>time-series database</strong> seems like a good match. I will demonstrate how to use <strong>QuestDB</strong>, an Apache 2.0 licensed project, to ingest and query data in <strong>milliseconds or faster</strong>.</p>\n<p>Data analytics often require a <strong>graphical dashboard</strong>. For this purpose, I will use <strong>Grafana OSS</strong>, where we will create a couple of real-time charts updating <strong>several times per second</strong>.</p>\n<p>And, of course, it's 2024, so you might want to delve into some <strong>data science</strong>. No worries. I will demonstrate how <strong>Jupyter Notebook</strong> can be used to read from your database and perform <strong>interactive data exploration</strong> and time-series <strong>forecasting</strong>.</p>\n<p>This will be a <strong>demo-driven</strong> presentation and I will share all the code I use so you can use it as a starting point.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Over the past decade, the field of AI has grown spectacularly, with many ground-breaking milestones being reported, such as a reinforcement learning agent that learnt to play ATARI games, AlphaGo that beat the best Go player in the world, reinforcement learning agents that learn to mitigate epidemics, deep learning models that predict protein structures and large language models that demonstrate interesting capabilities.\nWhile research in AI has traditionally been driven by academia, in the recent years, research companies, such as Deepmind and OpenAI, have been involved in significant breakthroughs. While in academia, there is a culture of keeping the reproducibility of scientific methods in high regard, which often goes hand in hand with making algorithms available as free or open-source software, this is not always the case in research companies.\nIn this talk, we explore the free and open-source software ecosystem in the AI research community and contrast this with closed source applications, of which we discuss the ethical implications from the perspective of the scientific community. As research companies such as Deepmind and OpenAI explicitly state that their mission is to develop Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), we look ahead whether the first AGI instance will be free or open-source software and discuss what the implications might be for the scientific community and society in general.</p>",

So we must convene as a community to save the internet — but how, when by virtuous design we as a community are distributed and decentralized? By learning from the distributed teams who have been responsible for reacting in crisis situations for centuries. In this talk, I’ll explore how we can apply social network analysis findings gleaned from studying disaster response teams in laboratory and field settings to empower leadership and strengthen community ties in pursuit of our collective goal: to ensure the internet is free, open, and safe for all, forever.</p>",

Unlike other programming environments for microcontrollers, MicroBlocks is LIVE. That is, the MicroBlocks IDE (editor running on a computer) and the MicroBlocks code (running on a microcontroller) are constantly kept in sync. The blocks-based editor makes it easy to click any block or script of blocks to execute them immediately. Development and debugging occur at the same time. The project lives up to its tagline \"small, fast, human friendly\". :)</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>The Linux Kernel lies at the heart of many high profile services and applications. And since the kernel code executes at the highest privilege level it is very important to keep up with kernel updates to ensure the production systems are patched in a timely manner for numerous security vulnerabilities discovered almost every day.</p>\n<p>Yet, because the kernel code executes at the highest privilege level and a kernel bug usually crashes the whole system, many SREs, production engineers and system administrators try to avoid upgrading the kernel too often just for the sake of stability. In many companies we have seen a tendency to create more obstacles to Linux kernel releases (requiring more approvals, harder update justifications, requiring more time in canary testing etc). But introducing all these obstacles and not treating kernel updates like any other software updates usually significantly increases the risk for the company and their service of being exploited.</p>\n<p>One of the reasons SREs and production engineers are too afraid of ANY kernel upgrade is that they don’t actually know the details about Linux kernel release process and policy. This talk tries to demystify Linux Kernel releases and provides a guide on how to distinguish a kernel bugfix release from a feature release. We also try to explore why commonly established perceptions and patterns around production kernel releases are wrong and how you actually risk the stability of your systems by not releasing the kernel regularly. In the end we describe how kernel releases are implemented in our company and propose possible approaches to deploy kernel upgrades regularly with minimal risk.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>The idea of using the comparatively new TPM2.0 as an infinite keystore was first proposed in 2016.  Since then the base enabling work has been done inside the Linux Kernel and at the engine and provider layer of openssl and separately in gnupg (from 2.3).  The main stumbling block in openssl, that of engine key enabling, has finally been mitigated by the openssl 3 move to providers.  The big outlier is still openssh, which won't embrace either engines or providers, but the gpg-agent can be used to provide a TPM key based ssh-agent emulation.  In this session, we'll review where we are and how to use a laptop TPM as a keystore (including a demonstration of ssh, gpg openssl and kernel based TPM keys), and where we're going including using TPM sealed keys with policy in the Linux Kernel to unlock disks under particular circumstances; the addition of localities to give keys which cannot be unsealed outside the kernel and the use of signed policies to try to counter the brittleness of PCR locking for measured boot (a signed policy key is a key that has a base policy, like locality, but which can have a set of signed policies that specify things like PCR values, which may be added to after the key was created).</p>",

These queues can be fed at “interrupt” levels.</p>\n<p>Finite-state-machines are nearly direct Actor specifications (as is TLA) and form the first set of composable bug-free modules.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>The D programming language has been quietly growing for well over two decades. This modern programming language supports multiple programming paradigms, a range of memory safety features, and an ecosystem with 3 open source compilers. So why should an open source developer consider learning or using the D programming language? In this talk I will show examples of how D has replaced all of my Python code for my projects, and why I think D truly is a language that allows you to \"write fast, read fast, and run fast\" code. I will introduce the language, several of my favorite productivity features, and tools in the D programming language ecosystem. Throughout the talk, the audience will also be pointed to several open source tools written in the D language to be inspired from. Audience members looking for a new language to learn, or otherwise the programming language enthusiast may also benefit from a tour of the D language and its features.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Enhancing server performance typically entails achieving one or more of the following objectives: reduce latency, increase number of requests per second (RPS), and minimize CPU and memory usage. These goals can be pursued through architectural modifications, such as eliminating some network hops, distributing data across multiple servers, upgrading to more powerful hardware, and so forth. This talk is not about that.</p>\n<p>I categorize the primary sources of code performance degradation into three groups:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Thread contention. For instance, too hot mutexes, overly strict order in lock-free operations, and false sharing.</li>\n<li>Heap utilization. Loss is often caused by frequent allocation and deallocation of large objects, and by the absence of intrusive containers at hand.</li>\n<li>Network IO. Socket reads and writes are expensive due to being system calls. Also they can block the thread for a long time, resulting in hacks like adding tens or hundreds more threads. Such measures intensify contention, as well as CPU and memory usage, while neglecting the underlying issue.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I present a series of concise and straightforward low-level recipes on how to gain performance via code optimizations. While often requiring just a handful of changes, the proposals might amplify the performance N-fold.</p>\n<p>The suggestions target the mentioned bottlenecks caused by certain typical mistakes. Proposed optimizations might render architectural changes not necessary, or even allow to simplify the setup if existing servers start coping with the load effortlessly. As a side effect, the changes can make the code cleaner and reveal more bottlenecks to investigate.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Crash-consistent snapshots of storage volumes are a required feature in today’s storage systems. In <strong>Kubernetes</strong>, the <strong>CSI</strong> protocol introduced the <code>VolumeGroupSnapshot</code> concept which requires <em>crash-consistent snapshots</em> be guaranteed within the context of volumes, which may be block devices or mounts on a distributed POSIX file system such as <strong>CephFS</strong>. This talk will cover the challenges and mechanisms to achieve this design goal. In particular, we will show how <strong>CephFS</strong> provides consistency by exposing a new API to pause write IOs to a set of volumes for the duration of the snapshot process. We will explore the new API, the mechanisms used to achieve this IO pause and discuss broadly the software changes made to <strong>Ceph</strong>.</p>",

It is home to the world's largest particle accelerator (<a href=\"https://www.home.cern/science/accelerators/large-hadron-collider\">Large Hadron Collider, LHC</a>) and is the birthplace of the <a href=\"https://www.home.cern/science/computing/birth-web\">Web</a>.</p>\n<p>CERN's Storage and Data Management Group is responsible for enabling data storage and access for the CERN laboratory, in particular the long-term archival, preservation and distribution of LHC data to a worldwide scientific community (<a href=\"https://wlcg.web.cern.ch/\">WLCG</a>). Today we operate  heterogeneous disk and tape software defined storage systems, with several large <a href=\"https://eos-web.web.cern.ch/eos-web/\">EOS</a> disk farms, the <a href=\"https://cta.web.cern.ch/cta/\">CERN Tape Archive (CTA)</a> system and other storage solutions. In total the group manages more than one exabyte of storage across about 2,000 data servers (60,000 disks) and 50,000 high-capacity tapes and orchestrates more than 4 exabytes of data transfers every year.  More than 30,000 users need to access these data from their computers in a user-friendly way, which has been made possible through the <a href=\"https://cernbox.web.cern.ch/cernbox/\">CERNBox</a> project, CERN's open source cloud sync and share platform. The group also operates a large Ceph cluster (over 60 petabytes)  mostly to support the CERN OpenStack Cloud Computing infrastructure.</p>\n<p>All of these systems are open source and available for use and hosting on-premise.</p>\n<p>In this talk we would like to give you a high level view of the following technologies and how they work together to satisfy the storage needs of the organisation: from the early phases of data taking, to its distribution and final end-user analysis.</p>\n<p>EOS provides a service for storing large amounts of physics data and user files (accounting today for more than 1 exabyte), with a focus on interactive and batch analysis with multi-protocol support (WebDAV, HTTP, FUSE, CIFS). It supports different authentication protocols (KRB5, X509, OIDC). </p>\n<p>CTA (CERN Tape Archive) is the archival storage system for the custodial copy of all physics data at CERN. The CTA software provides a free and open source platform for managing data on magnetic tapes at scale.</p>\n<p>CERNBox is the CERN cloud storage platform that provides sync and share functionality on top of the EOS and Ceph storage systems. It is built on top of the ownCloud open source product and the Reva project.</p>\n<p>All of these systems are open source and available for use and are deployed in other laboratories around the world.</p>",

Within edge nodes, constrained resources may require the use of hyperconverged storage solutions. OpenNebula has recently integrated Ceph as the foundational SDS solution for these edge deployments. This innovation enables the dynamic deployment of nodes through orchestrated infrastructure provisioning (based on Terraform), autoconfiguration of Ceph and virtualization subsystems (through Ansible), and cloud-edge management (using OpenNebula). This presentation discusses the seamless integration of these components to automate edge location management and to provision additional edge nodes in multi-provider edge cloud environments, highlighting the effectiveness of Ceph as an edge storage solution and showcasing a live technical demonstration of this innovative open source model.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Efficiently migrating petabytes of object storage data between two production Ceph clusters posed a significant challenge with live data being written to both clusters, necessitating a seamless process to minimize disruptions. The migration strategy involved extracting user accounts, including access and secret keys, from the old cluster and seamlessly transferring them to the new one. The synchronization of buckets and live data has been improved by extending and enhancing powerful tools such as rclone, executed in parallel. This migration endeavor not only resulted in the successful transfer of vast amounts of data but also paved the way for the creation of a robust tool named Chorus. Chorus, specifically designed for synchronizing S3 data, emerged as a versatile solution capable of harmonizing data seamlessly across multiple cloud storage backends. This innovative tool is helpful in effective bridging of data between Ceph clusters, demonstrating the adaptability and scalability required for modern data management challenges. Key highlights of Chorus include persistence of migration, execution of migration on multiple machines, rate limiting RAM/network usage during migration.</p>",

By adding new procedures to the <a href=\"https://github.com/csi-addons/spec\">CSI-Addons Specification</a>, additional operations for storage systems can be provided. The reference implementation is done on Kubernetes, and maintained in the <a href=\"https://github.com/csi-addons/kubernetes-csi-addons\">Kubernetes CSI-Addons</a> repository. Some of the advanced storage operations that are currently supported are reclaim space, network fence and volume replication.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Verilog-AMS is a standardised modelling language widely used in analog and mixed-signal design, but without an open reference implementation. Gnucap is a modular mixed-signal circuit simulator that partially implements Verilog-AMS, that aspires to eventually implement the complete language. In 2023, with NLnet support, we made significant progress in support for Verilog-AMS, the \"analog\" part, also known as Verilog-A, both on the simulator side and in the model compiler. For 2024, we will extend the work, concentrating on three tasks. The first is extensions to modelgen, the model compiler, essentially completing the analog part of Verilog-AMS, with some digital. The second task is enhancements to the simulator, mostly related to fast simulation of large mixed circuits, with both analog and digital parts. The first and second tasks are related to the \"mixed-signal\" aspect of Verilog-AMS. The third task addresses interoperability with other software, including schematic entry and layout, ability for Gnucap to use device models from other simulators, for modelgen to generate code to be used with other simulators, and porting some analysis commands.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>The semiconductor industry has been evolving and innovating for the past 75 years, ever since the first semiconductor transistor was invented. This rapid growth is driven by the direct and proactive contribution of the FOSS CAD/EDA to the entire technology flow: from state-of-the-art semiconductor technologies, device level compact/SPICE modeling, its Verilog-A standardization to advanced IC designs for various HiTech applications. However, the semiconductor industry also faces many challenges in maintaining the growth of its workforce with skilled technicians and engineers. To address the increasing need for well-trained workers worldwide, we need to find innovative ways to attract skilled talent and strengthen the local semiconductor workforce ecosystem. The FOSS CAD/EDA tools with the recently available open access PDKs provide a new platform to connect IC design beginners, enthusiasts and experienced mentors to benefit from the collaboration opportunities enabled by the fast-growing open-source IC design movement. FOSS IC design collaboration is increasingly possible due to the rapid growth of open access PDKs recently offered by SkyWater, GF and IHP. This paper demonstrates the FOSS CAD/EDA contribution to the SPICE/Verilog-A modeling/standardization, compete IC design flow (Xschem, Qucs-S, ngspice, Xyce, OpenVAF, OpenEMS, Magic, kLayout, OpenRoad) as well as selected open source analog/RF and digital IC design examples.</p>",

It was the first blockchain created after Bitcoin, and the only one supported by Satoshi before his disappearance. </p>\n<p>Namecoin uses a blockchain both to hold the names registry data and to automate the registration process itself. In the 13 years that passed since its inception, the field had additional strides of innovation, courtesy of projects such as Handshake or ENS. Recently, blockchain name systems have surged in popularity, with each blockchain having its own name system, some with a thriving developer's base and users communities.</p>\n<p>In this talk, we survey the evolution of blockchain name systems from Namecoin to the present day.

    "abstract": "<p>Trains are planned with margins compared to their fastest possible drive. Without them, they would not be able to catch up in case of a delay. A train departing 5 minutes late would arrive at least 5 minutes late. A driver accelerating or braking a bit slower than planned would inevitably be late. The entire transportation plan would fail.</p>\n<p>Those margins/allowances consist of adding extra time to the total running time. This implies planning trains with a lower speed than the maximum they could physically drive.</p>\n<p>There are many ways to lower the speed of a train along its trip, but one of them is particularely efficient in terms of energy savings. The algorithm MARECO, developped by SNCF, details an entire strategy for this purpose: how to plan a train that would intelligently drives slower in a way that consume the least amount of energy ?</p>\n<p>In this talk we will go though the main ideas of the algorithm, then we will compare its efficiency to other margin distribution stratgies on a few relevant examples, and finally we will discuss the impact of this algorithm on train planning and operation.</p>",

It is essential for Deutsche Bahn, that prototypes can be built and tested very quickly and cost-effectively.\nThe talk provides an insight into the open source software ThingsBoard and the IoT construction kit Tinkerforge. After this, we will make a live demo and build a IoT system to monitor the air quality in the conference room. This gives you a very easy entry into the world of IoT.\nFinally, we would like to share our experience in conducting IoT hackathons to find solutions or recruit young talent and present three unusual IoT use cases at Deutsche Bahn.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>The vision of the free Android app <a href=\"https://transportr.app/\">Transportr</a> is to provide easy access to accurate public transport data; without proprietary code, tracking, and ads. By simply switching the region, Transportr presents the same consistent user interface for daily commutes in Berlin as for holidays in Nicaragua. Thanks to shared code with its alternative Öffi, Transportr had support for official and third-party public transport APIs of more than 60 regions from Europe and other parts of the world at its peak. Apps such as Transportr have potential to ease the path into an ecological future with a seamless experience for public transport users regardless of their location.</p>\n<p>This talk gives a recap of Transportr's history and some notes on its current state, but is mostly meant to be a starting point for discussion about the future of the app, the potential of combining efforts with similar projects, and a call for contributions to the community!</p>",

There is a need for close contact between the open source world and the heritage railway world.\nVolunteer run heritage railways operate on a tight budget and with little computer expertise. They need support in ticketing, project planning, customer communication, enterprise management, networking, internal communication, archiving, ...\nIn this talk I will briefly show some of what we are using at Dampfbahn Fränkische Schweiz e.V., which problems we face. I will present an initiative to connect the IT experts with museum railways.

    "abstract": "<p>As developers, we write unit tests in a TDD-style workflow for validating the behavior of our applications and libraries. However, all possible situations need to be manually thought out when writing the tests for the code. Property based testing aims to solve this by allowing the developer to specify behavior of their programs in terms of properties (invariants) of their code and then automatically generating tests that check if the property is indeed valid. In this talk, the key concepts of property based testing will be explained, along with clarifying examples, ranging from introductory snippets to more complex ‘real life’ scenarios. The examples will be written in Elixir; a functional programming language that runs on the Erlang virtual machine. The high level, flexible and expressive nature of the language make it an ideal fit for declaring properties against which a program can be checked.</p>",

Building on state machines as a model to reimplement technical debt, we will traverse the intersection of gen_statem practical implementation and the theoretical foundations of state machines. Using real-world application examples, we will go over from the industry beast to the theoretical abyss, revealing the mathematical elegance inherent in state machines and its more powerful automata siblings. Bridging this gap, we will empower Erlang developers to architect solutions that go beyond conventional patterns, with concrete examples and plenty of code to read, providing the attendees with a comprehensive vision to harness the full potential of gen_statem.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>It is tough to figure why Erlang or Elixir code is failing, or how unknown software is working. When confronted with an unusual error, we might search for it in the code, which often gives multiple results, so we resort to guessing. We might also decide to trace with tools like dbg or recon, but here we need to guess, which functions to trace. I would like to show you a different approach, where the first step is to trace multiple modules or even whole apps. Then you can query, analyse, process and even execute the collected traces. The <a href=\"https://github.com/chrzaszcz/erlang_doctor\">tool</a> itself is so simple, that you will be able to use it instantly. It is also battle-proven, as I have used it numerous times to debug the <a href=\"https://github.com/esl/MongooseIM\">MongooseIM</a> project, which I am leading. Limit unnecessary guesswork and have more time for creative work.</p>",

In this talk you'll hear about a selection of tools that are good additions to your documentation pipeline, and how to use them both locally and in CI. We'll cover linting and validation of your source content, and look at tools that can help with consistent formatting. We'll also look at content quality tools, such as prose linting, link checking, and more. You'll see examples of projects that use some or all of these tools in anger, and we'll also discuss when too many tools is too many! This session is recommended for anyone who works on documentation platforms as either writer or engineer, and wants to make their world better.</p>",

I will present a high-level overview of the project, highlight the features that got me hooked, and share my personal experience with using it to produce technical documentation.</p>\n<p>To demonstrate how easy it is to get started with Material for MkDocs from scratch, I will build a small documentation website step-by-step live during the talk to showcase some of its features.\nMaterial for MkDocs makes writing documentation easy and rewarding, and significantly lowers the bar to produce good looking yet practical technical documentation for free and open source software projects.</p>\n<p>It features a <a href=\"https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/\">broad set of features</a>, including (but not limited to):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>documentation written in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown\">MarkDown</a>;</li>\n<li>easy <a href=\"https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/\">installation</a> (via <code>pip</code>) and <a href=\"https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/creating-your-site/#configuration\">configuration</a> (via <code>mkdocs.yml</code>);</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/code-blocks\">code blocks</a> with syntax highlighting;</li>\n<li>support for <a href=\"https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/changing-the-colors/#color-scheme\">dark/light mode</a>;</li>\n<li>fast and powerful <a href=\"https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/setting-up-site-search/\">search</a>;</li>\n<li>eye-popping customisable notes/warnings/tips via <a href=\"https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/admonitions/\">admonitions</a>;</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/content-tabs/\">content tabs</a>;</li>\n<li>support for <a href=\"https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/icons-emojis/\">icons and emoji</a>;</li>\n<li>integration with GitHub Pages and GitLab Pages for <a href=\"https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/publishing-your-site/\">easy publishing</a>;</li>\n<li>integration with <code>Mermaid.js</code> for <a href=\"https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/diagrams\">creating diagrams</a>;</li>\n<li>integration with MathJax and KaTeX for <a href=\"https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/math\">displaying mathematical formulas</a>;</li>\n<li>built-in support for integrating a <a href=\"https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/plugins/blog/\">blog</a> into your documentation;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Material for MkDocs is open source first (MIT-licensed), and follows the <em>sponsorware</em> release strategy (see <a href=\"https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/insiders/\">Insiders</a>). This means that new features are first exclusively released to sponsors and later become part of the free community edition when specific funding goals are met, which helps making the project sustainable.</p>\n<p>It is used by plethora of FOSS projects &amp; beyond, like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>arXiv, the open-access paper preprint repository: <a href=\"https://info.arxiv.org\">info.arxiv.org</a>;</li>\n<li>AutoGPT, a semi-autonomous agent powered by LLMs: <a href=\"https://docs.agpt.co\">docs.agpt.co</a>;</li>\n<li>CentOS, the Linux distribution: <a href=\"https://docs.infra.centos.org\">docs.infra.centos.org</a>;</li>\n<li>FastAPI, the Python web framework for building APIs: <a href=\"https://fastapi.tiangolo.com\">fastapi.tiangolo.com</a>;</li>\n<li>LUMI, Europe's fastest supercomputer: <a href=\"https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/\">docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu</a>;</li>\n<li>Open Source at Siemens: <a href=\"https://opensource.siemens.com\">opensource.siemens.com</a>;</li>\n<li>PyPI, the Python Package Index: <a href=\"https://docs.pypi.org\">docs.pypi.org</a>;</li>\n</ul>",

    "abstract": "<p>Napoleon reportedly said that a good sketch is better than a long speech. This might make him the first practitioner of model based system engineering. MBSE is an approach to system engineering where document based communication is exchanged for building a domain model. This is typically done through graphical languages like UML or <a href=\"https://sysml.org/\">SysML</a>. A model gives us the opportunity to query it, run tests against it and verify it's validity.</p>\n<p>This talk will demonstrate how a model can be built with <a href=\"https://gaphor.org/\">Gaphor</a> and how it's integration with the wider Python ecosystem can help us to prevent mistakes. It won't prevent you from attempting to invade the Russian Empire in wintertime but it will help you make sure your system architecture is sane.</p>",

As chat-based search engines, powered by machine learning and artificial intelligence, use an LLM (Large Language Model), they have no other knowledge than an algorithm that predicts the most likely word that should follow the previous ones. On top of that, these LLMs are not up-to-date, as they are generated with a \"snapshot\" of available data at a specific date when the LLM is being developed.</p>\n<p>But how do we cope with the challenge that our managers and end-users want us to provide a chat-based user interface that produces correct results?</p>\n<p>At Azul, all our public knowledge about Java and the products we deliver is combined on docs.azul.com. It's a \"classic documentation\" website, generated as a static website based on AsciiDoc files. As Java lovers, we experimented with several free, open-source tools to make our docs chat-searchable. Join this session to learn if we can dump traditional docs and enter the chat age...</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>We've all seen the memes about Google Chrome devouring all the available RAM in your laptop. Is that only due to how the browser works or is it also our fault as web apps developers? In fact, modern JS apps are becoming increasingly complicated, so their compute and memory requirement are rising as well, with some famous websites even taking up entire gigabytes of memory. This does not only fill up the memory of your users devices, but can also cause crashes and performance drops. How do we monitor if that's the case, and how can we fix it? This talk will shed some light on the dark art of memory allocations and profiling, showing how some data structures and some JS frameworks are less efficient than others. Also, what are the tools that are available to measure it, such as the Chrome Memory Profiler and MemLab, showcasing some custom tooling I've built around those two.</p>",

The goal is to recreate a lost packet, based on other transmitted packets and redundant information included in specific FEC packets.</p>\n<p>Packet losses are well handled for audio streams thanks to Packet Loss Concealment (PLC), which makes them almost un-noticeable to the end users. However, they are far more complicated to handle for video data. \nFEC offers a solution to compensate the loss rates typically observed over the Internet. At the expense of a relatively low overhead and small latency, the redundancy information transmitted by the sender lets the receiver re-create the missing packets.</p>\n<p>There are currently various FEC standard techniques and approaches documented at IETF.\nThe Linphone project has selected the Flexible Forward Error Correction scheme (flexfec) documented in RFC8627.</p>\n<p>This talk will talk about:\n- the principles of Forward Error Correction\n- why the Linphone team chose the Flexible Forward Error Correction scheme\n- what were the implementation challenges\n- what are the observable results at the Linphone app level</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Shig is a federated live stream broadcasting service designed to distribute live streams among cross-domain Fediverse instances on the backend side via WebRTC. The service has an ActivityPub implementation and clones the stream on the backend side. Shig is designed using the WHIP/WHEP approach for both incoming and outgoing streams, eliminating the necessity for an additional Signal Server. The \"cloning\" of live streams across domain boundaries enables different kinds of live video content distribution, as well as interactions with live streams, such as multi-guest streaming.</p>\n<p>Links: \nhttps://github.com/shigde/\nhttps://shig.de\nhttps://mastodon.social/@shig</p>\n<p>Docu:\nhttps://github.com/shigde/sfu/blob/main/docs/README.md\nhttps://github.com/shigde/sfu/blob/main/docs/use-cases.md</p>",

This makes it a particularly interesting codec to use in WebRTC applications of different kinds, from web conferencing to streaming and more.</p>\n<p>This presentation will cover how AV1 is used on top of RTP, how SVC is signalled and used within the context of an ad-hoc (and pretty convoluted) RTP extension, and the efforts I had to make to get all that to work in the Janus WebRTC Server. If time permits, I'll show a brief demo of how it works too.</p>",

The presentation goes through the C API that can be used to add STIR/SHAKEN capabilities to exiting applications, exemplifying with how it was done for Kamailio SIP Server. Several use cases for the CLI tool will show how it can be used to test other STIR/SHAKEN implementations or validate related values, plugging in the mix examples with the HTTP RESTApi server that could facilitate rapid addition of STIR/SHAKEN to existing VoIP systems without needing to write code.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Rust provides unsafe language features to interact with hardware or call into non-Rust libraries. However, this shifts responsibility for ensuring memory safety to the developer. Failing to do so may lead to memory-safety violations in unsafe code, which can violate the safety of the entire application. In this talk, we explore in-process isolation with Memory Protection Keys as a mechanism to shield safe program sections from safety violations that may happen in unsafe sections. Our approach is easy to use and comprehensive, as it prevents heap and stack-based violations. We further compare process-based and in-process isolation mechanisms and the necessary requirements for data serialization, communication, and context switching. We specifically explored various Rust serialization crates such as Abomonation and bincode. Our results show that in-process isolation can be effective and efficient, permits for a high degree of automation, and also enables a notion of application rewinding where the safe program section may detect and safely handle violations in unsafe code. However, even for modestly sized arguments, the context switch cost starts to get dominated by the cost of data transfer between domains. Here, the Rust data serialization method used can significantly impact performance and thus, it is crucial to optimize it for the use case at hand.\nWe open-source our prototype and experimental evaluation data under a BSD license on GitHub: https://secure-rewind-and-discard.github.io/</p>",

Using WASM, we'll see how to port a desktop app in pure Rust to a webapp using WASM. We'll survey the WASM ecosystem: tools, crates, and share tips and hurdles found along the way.\nMost native languages nowadays can be compiled to WASM, and Rust is no exception. Using an emulator written in pure Rust, we'll explore the challenges of porting a desktop Linux app to the web platform. How hard can it be ? Following through the outline of the emulator, we'll go step by step, and expose which crates make that easy, discover how mature is the Rust WASM ecosystem and tools we need to use to port an app.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Tower is a crate of “modular and reusable components for building robust networking clients and servers” widely used in prominent projects within the Rust ecosystem, including Hyper*, Axum, or Tonic. This ubiquity means Rust developers invariably engage with the <code>Service</code> trait, Tower's core abstraction, while working with these libraries. Despite its conciseness, reading and understanding code that abstracts over the <code>Service</code> trait proves challenging because of the heavy use of generics and intricacies of implementing non-boxed futures. This complexity raises the learning curve for beginner and intermediate Rust developers to become proficient in their favorite frameworks. In this talk, we will demystify the <code>Service</code> trait, explore practical examples from real-world codebases, and construct increasingly complex Tower layers from scratch.</p>\n<p>*Hyper actually relies on its own very similar <code>hyper::Service</code> trait.</p>",

One of the goals for this year has been making Servo a practical embeddable rendering engine, making easier to embed it in Rust projects. We’ve already come a long way in this area. A key achievement is our development of a minibrowser, which showcases how the Servo engine can be integrated.</p>\n<p>In this talk, the main focus will be on the embedding of Servo. We will dive into the technical aspects of the minibrowser, demonstrating how our developments have streamlined the process of embedding Servo, the challenges we’ve faced, and the solutions we’ve developed. Additionally, we will also talk about the future direction of Servo embedding in Rust projects.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Biospecimens and high-quality clinical data are essential for cancer research. At the same time, health data is highly sensitive with regards to data protection, hence, instead of centralizing all the data, federated information systems enable researchers to locate and work with data/biospecimens having certain characteristics, e.g. specimen type, diagnosis, and molecular markers, across hospitals, countries, or even continents. At the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Germany’s largest biomedical research center, we develop, operate, and maintain such national infrastructures in hospitals and biobanks around Germany, Europe and the world, using 100% FLOSS. Recently, we have re-implemented and open-sourced key components in Rust with great benefits towards stability, safety and performance. In particular, we report on Beam, a distributed task broker for efficient communication across strict network environments, and Focus, a federated query dispatcher protecting patient privacy using differential privacy.</p>",

    "abstract": "<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>Bootloaders are one of the biggest pain points when it comes to booting upstream\nLinux on Qualcomm devices, they require that distros support 5 versions of the Android\nboot image header, weird non-standard devicetree properties, and are\ngenerally a huge headache. As modifying the bootloader is out of the question,\nwe can at least replace the environment it gives us with a more sensible one...</p>\n<p>In this talk, I'll give a brief introduction to what an EFI bootloader actually is,\nhow they work, and how U-Boot fits into the picture as a second-stage\nbootloader. I'll cover the work I've been doing to improve Qualcomm support in\nupstream U-Boot, and how we can drastically lower the barrier of entry for\ndistro support on Qualcomm phones.</p>\n<p>Lastly, I'll go over the new process for porting a Qualcomm SoC to U-Boot, and\ndemo booting Linux with EFI runtime support on a Qualcomm phone.</p>\n<p>I'll also give a sneak peak at what would be possible if we had greater ownership of our devices.</p>\n<h2>Why you should care</h2>\n<p>This talk is primarily aimed at the upstream community, if you work on upstream support for any Qualcomm devices - be it phone, tablet, Chromebook, or vehicle - then you can likely benefit from running U-Boot.</p>\n<p>UEFI is now the lowest common denominator, and supporting it makes Qualcomm devices a viable target for more mainstream distros.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Marius has been playing around with VoLTE with Qualcomm Mediatek devices. He has got to the point of being able to make and receive calls and send and receive SMSs on Ubuntu Touch ported devices. It is still very hacky. Without any knowledge of the modem stack it seemed impossibly difficult, but now we are getting some insights into how it works it is possible to see how the binary blobs are doing stuff. The way forward was to run Android and capture all the calls made to the drivers. Sailfish have some of it working, so their solution provided tools too.</p>\n<p>The fixes so far are very specific, every proprietary system has its own unique way of doing things. It is a horrible standard, and no carrier even follows the standard. The modem is a black box with no outputs. To be honest, when it works, we don’t know why it works. It works perfectly well, though, so result. He would like to share his results, to discuss with the wider community how we can roll this out to get more devices supported.</p>\n<p>In the recent and coming years 2G and 3G are being phased out by network operators, especially on a lot of Mobile Foss OSes that are Halium based. This means that they will be useless because you can't make calls any more. It has been extremely difficult to enable VoLTE service due to all the proprietary components.</p>\n<p>VoLTE stands for Voice over LTE, and LTE (Long Term Evolution) is better known as 4G. So essentially, VoLTE amounts to mobile calls over a 4G network.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Since the introduction of Genode for the PinePhone at this developer room one\nyear ago, this alternative mobile OS has matured to the point of real-world\nusability for a group of pilot users. In this talk, Genode developer Norman\nFeske is going to share the experiences made along the way, reiterate the many\nadvances, demonstrate the current version, and ask: What should come next?</p>\n<h2>Description</h2>\n<p>Genode on the PinePhone realizes a new vision of a smartphone OS designed from\nthe ground up for user autonomy. Following the announcement of the very first\nversion at the FOSS-on-Mobile developer room in 2023, the system got into the\nhands of a group of pilot users. The talk will share this experience\nand highlight the key points we met towards our goal of real-world usability.</p>\n<p>First, we found it important to attain a tight feedback loop between testers\nand us developers, which prompted us to create a system-update mechanism that\nallows for instantly updating the system, or rolling it back to any previous\nversion. Now, a new version can reach the hands of testers in a matter of\nseconds.</p>\n<p>With the quick way of testing new versions in place, the feedback we got\nregarding our attempts at implementing energy-saving measures - in particular\nscreen blanking - was quite instructive to attain a refined solution. At a\ntechnical level, the solution is interesting as it combines a Forth-based\ncustom power-management firmware with Genode's microkernel-based architecture.\nDon't worry, the talk will only briefly touch those eccentricities.</p>\n<p>With the power drain reduced to a practical level, we turned our\nattention to the application level. The talk will briefly introduce our\nSDK named Goa, which streamlines the development to the point\nwhere almost unmodified Qt/QML-based applications can be targeted at the\nGenode-based phone. To stress the latter point, we made the Linphone VoIP\nstack available on this system.</p>\n<p>The talk will be garnished by practical demonstrations. Besides being thrilled\nto present the current state, I'm eager to gather feedback from the community\nabout the most worthwhile directions for the next year.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>This talk delves into the evolution of Ubuntu Touch on PINE64 devices since its release in 2020. Over the past several years there have been significant changes, both to the development team and the codebase.  </p>\n<p>The shifts in the UBPorts/PINE64 community stem from the original PinePhone port’s maintainer moving on from the project, which coincided with the release of the PinePhone Pro. This left the community at a crossroads: necessitating the search for a new maintainer and the development of a new port.  </p>\n<p>A key milestone in this journey was the showcasing of an early-stage community port for the PinePhone Pro running on Ubuntu Touch 20.04 at FOSDEM last year. Since then, a new maintainer has achieved remarkable improvements, including porting 20.04 to the original PinePhone and PineTab, as well as the newly released PineTab2.  </p>\n<p>This presentation will explore the challenges encountered in integrating new devices, updating existing ones, and the process of harmonizing mainline Linux with Ubuntu Touch. This is particularly crucial as Ubuntu Touch has historically leaned towards devices designed for Android/Halium-based devices, somewhat sidelining mainline Linux in the transition to 20.04. Furthermore, the discussion will extend to the future prospects of this port and its implications for Lomiri on mainline Linux across different distributions.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>The Gecko rendering engine is used in many weird and wonderful places. For over a decade it has been the stock rendering engine for the default browser on Sailfish OS, a Linux-based mobile operating system for use on mobile phones and tablets.</p>\n<p>The browser implementation was originally developed around the EmbedLite/xulrunner API, which is no longer officially supported. This provides interesting challenges for keeping the browser up-to-date with the latest Gecko changes.</p>\n<p>For the last 92 days (maybe more depending on when you're reading this) I've been <a href=\"https://www.flypig.co.uk/gecko\">daily-blogging</a> about my experiences upgrading the ESR 78 Gecko rendering engine used on Sailfish OS to ESR 91. Once ESR 91 is complete the plan is to move to ESR 102 and beyond. Eventually we hope to reach a stable rhythm alongside the official Gecko releases.</p>\n<p>This has been a communal effort, with other members of the Sailfish OS community helping with the development, from submitting changes to tooling to creating AI-generated images to liven up the blog posts. Many users from the community are now involved all with the singular aim of getting our Gecko upgraded. The breadth of technologies involved (Rust, C++, JavaScript, Python) makes it a fascinating project to work with and write about.</p>\n<p>We've learnt a lot about the Gecko codebase in the process as well as the challenges in deploying Gecko to unusual mobile and embedded platforms. Our hope is that once we reach the latest version, we'll be able to look into contributing more changes upstream to help maintain our Gecko deployment more easily in the future. We'd love to discuss the best way to achieve this.</p>\n<p>In this talk I'll share my experiences of working with Gecko in an open way and in collaboration with the community, before opening it out to a discussion about how best to work with upstream.</p>\n<p>Links:\n1. <a href=\"https://www.flypig.co.uk/gecko\">Daily dev diary</a>\n2. <a href=\"https://github.com/llewelld/gecko-dev\">EmbedLite source</a>\n3. <a href=\"https://github.com/sailfishos/sailfish-browser\">Sailfish Browser source and issue tracking</a></p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Calendars are a building block of our work tools. Unfortunately, managing calendars is often a nightmare. The reason for this is simple: the big companies hosting most of the calendar services are not trying very hard to provide interroperability between their services, or facilitate the use of calendars not hosted by themselves.\nOne particular setting that is very painful when using calendars is the case of public-calendars. While a lot of organizations have a public-calendar available to stay informed about the events they organize, it is actually very complicated to leverage these calendars in a natural way:\nFirst of all, not all caldav clients support public-calendars, or at least not as well as “account” calendars. Often, they allow to “bulk import” multiples ical events inside your calendar client but not suscribe to the underlying calendar. This means that new events will not be added to your calendar automatically;\n    Public-calendars are not easily composable: it is not possible to merge multiple public-calendars together in order for example to share a collection of calendars;\n    It is not possible to filter events in public-calendars. We may be interested only in a subset of events in a calendar (events occuring on mondays for example, or taking place in Paris, or any other criterion).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/JulienMalka/Linkal\">Linkal</a> is a software developped to solve the above problems. It is a public-calendar aggregator server. It acts as a man-in-the-middle between a caldav client and some public-calendars. Given a list of public-calendar, it emulates a calendar collection containing all these calendars. The user can then use its usual caldav client and add the collection as an “account” calendar (specifying the url of the Linkal instance instead of the caldav server). This allows the collection to be shared easily to multiple users and seamlessly updated.</p>\n<p>The talk will present the challenges to collaborations using calendars and the solutions that Linkal provides.</p>",

IT departments looking for such suites are forced to turn towards proprietary solutions such as Microsoft 365 or Google Workplace.</p>\n<p>However, alternatives are in the building. Among them, openDesk, an initiative lead by the German Ministry of Interior, stands out.</p>\n<p>This project aims at building a complete Open Source alternative to Microsoft 365, where the software, the integrations, and the infrastructure required for project are to be released under Open Source licences. At the core of this project are several European Open Source software vendors, including Univention (user management), Open-Xchange (email), Nextcloud (file management), Nordeck / Jitsi (video conferencing), Element (chat), Collabora (document editing), OpenProject (project management) and XWiki (knowledge management). Operations on the project are also coordinated by Dataport, a service provider for the German administration.</p>\n<p>This presentation will focus on describing the project, its governance, and describe how its different actors organize in order to foster integrations within Open Source products, and thus create a usable platform on top of them. The last part of the talk will show a demo of the current version of openDesk.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Progressively, there are more and more risks associated with computer intelligence, and as a transparent software company we have the responsibility to intervene and protect our users. Recently, Microsoft laid off its entire ethics and society team, the team that taught employees how to make AI tools responsibly. Nextcloud on the other hand, embraces the ethics and challenges that make up today’s AI and aims to take them head on.</p>\n<p>The field of AI is moving fast, and many of the new capabilities face ethical and even legal challenges.</p>\n<p>For example, there are problems with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Privacy and security of user data</li>\n<li>Discrimination and biases</li>\n<li>Energy usage</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In particular with neural networks based AI technologies, the mere availability of open source code is no longer enough to be able to say you are in control over your data or that the software is safe or ethical. The set of data and the software used in the training, as well as the availability of the final model are all factors that determine the amount of freedom and control a user has.</p>\n<p>Until Hub 3, we succeeded in offering features like related resources, recommended files, our priority inbox and even face and object recognition without reliance on proprietary blobs or third party servers.</p>\n<p>Yet, while there is a large community developing ethical, safe and privacy-respecting technologies, there are many other relevant technologies users might want to use. We want to provide users these cutting-edge technologies – but also be transparent. For some use cases, ChatGPT might be a reasonable solution, while for other data, it is paramount to have a local, on-prem, open solution. To differentiate these, we developed an Ethical AI Rating.</p>\n<p>Our Ethical AI Rating is designed to give a quick insight into the ethical implications of a particular integration of AI in Nextcloud. We of course still encourage users to look more deeply into the specific solution they use, but hope that this way we simplify the choice for the majority of our users and customers.</p>\n<p>I will describe how our Ethical AI rating works, and give a bunch of examples. And, as a bonus, show how it is integrated in Nextcloud and how it can help you get work done - without leaking your data!</p>\n<p>I look forward to any feedback you wonderful folks in the audience have.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Web Accessibility has a lot of complexities, and most CMS do not have the capacity to invest in it sufficiently. Two years ago Funka organized a Cross-CMS initiative to look at supporting content authors in their efforts to produce accessible content. This EC funded initiative, the We4Authors Cluster brought together Drupal, Joomla, Plone, and Umbreco. This is the only cross-CMS accessibility event I am aware of where maintainers collaborated on common UI elements. It is also the only one I am aware of where user research was done on authors, to help evaluate accessibility. We need more of this.  </p>\n<p>Currently, Environmental Sustainability in the CMS space is given even less of a priority than accessibility. We are in a climate crisis, digital tools are contributing to it, global best practices are emerging, but adoption of these best practices isn't happening fast enough. Collaboration is needed to both raise awareness within our industry, but also find common solutions. Finding common approaches to measure the CO2 impact is an important starting point. Much more will be needed if we are to help the web make significant reductions in energy consumption. </p>\n<p>These are two places where collaboration is key if we are able to make the advances which are needed for people with disabilities, as well as future generations. Where can we help to optimize our development process, code execution, and the cumulative impact of CO2 produced through the process.</p>",

(you can also tinker with this at home, of course)</p>\n<p>In this highly relevant example, we assume you control the heating for your customers' buildings. There is a heat pump and solar panels. You promise your customers to heat their home with their own solar power if possible. You even promise to use the cheapest grid power when the sun isn't shining. Green building, low energy bill!</p>\n<p>Our tutorial will turn this promise into reality ― in any case, the data-driven optimal computations you'd need (measuring and on/off control of hardware not included).</p>\n<p>FlexMeasures is a Flask web server, so this tutorial will use Python.\nWe will use the FlexMeasures API, but also its CLI and the Python client ― the possibilities are rich. We also show how to add custom logic in a FlexMeasures plugin.</p>\n<p>In short, we will:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>create a new customer account with the relevant asset models for this use case (via a new API endpoint, e.g. called from your CRM)</li>\n<li>feed local measurements (e.g. solar, temperature) regularly into your FlexMeasures server, using the FlexMeasures Python client</li>\n<li>get the latest price and weather forecast data from third-party-APIs (regularly via cron jobs), using existing FlexMeasures plugins</li>\n<li>create forecasts for solar data and prices (regularly via cron jobs)</li>\n<li>call the FlexMeasures scheduler to compute when to draw green &amp; cheap electricity for heating (via the FlexMeasures API) which you can out to use in the building</li>\n<li>define a cost reporter and let it run (regularly via cron jobs)</li>\n<li>configure a FlexMeasures dashboard to show the relevant data in one place</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We hope to see you there, and that some of you get inspired to put some climate tech into the field!</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>In the rapidly evolving landscape of electric vehicle charging, the Open Charge Point Protocol (OCPP) has emerged as a crucial industry standard for communication between charging stations and a central management system. In my presentation I will introduce groundbreaking extensions to OCPP, focusing on the integration of end-to-end digital signatures and binary data streams, a leap forward in efficiency and security within the EV charging ecosystem.  </p>\n<p>The integration of binary data streams via HTTP Web Sockets into OCPP marks a significant enhancement in data transmission efficiency. This approach not only reduces latency and bandwidth usage for large data transfers, but also paves the way for more secure, in-band data transmissions like firmware updates or log file transport. Traditionally, such data transfers required separate HTTP or FTP servers, introducing unnecessary complexity and potential network security risks. With these extensions firmware updates become seamless and more secure, directly within the OCPP framework.  </p>\n<p>Furthermore, the addition of digital signatures to OCPP commands and data structures, such as charging tariffs or grid related commands for controllable consumers according to the German §14a EnWG, introduce a new layer of security and integrity. These signatures ensure that data is not tampered with during transmission - even beyond the traditional scope of OCPP - providing a verifiable trust mechanism in end-to-end EV charging communications and might in the future lead to more cost-efficient intelligent measuring systems. </p>\n<p>A notable advancement is the use of digital signatures for creating distinct user roles within OCPP. Until now, OCPP lacked the capability to differentiate between user access levels, such as \"normal\" users and \"admin\" users. The introduction of role-based access control, underpinned by digital signatures, allows for precise management of user permissions, enhancing both security and operational efficiency especially in more complex managed charging locations.  </p>\n<p>In my talk, I will delve into the technical implementation details of these extensions. Attendees will gain insights into the practical applications and benefits of these enhancements in the context of the Open Source energy ecosystem. The presentation will also explore the potential future implications and developments that these extensions could usher in, setting the stage for a more secure, efficient, and scalable EV charging infrastructure.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>The open source OCPP 2.0.1 CSMS project CitrineOS was initiated by S44. By leveraging over a decade of experience in EV charging software, at S44 we are actively working towards making EV charging more attainable and equitable. \nIn our quest for a greener future, we face a pivotal challenge: by 2030 50% of new U.S. cars will be EVs, but today 28% of chargers in leading cities don't work. Developers must build innovative software to improve and grow the charging network so EV owners can travel with confidence. \nBy creating an open source charge station management system, CitrineOS's goal is to  provide the fuel for this change. The project is NEVI compliant, globally available and open to all. CitrineOS is meant to offer a community driven, reliable CSMS that builds a foundation for market participants to innovate on top of a protocol implementation instead of re-inventing the same wheel. \nThe project drives forward the adoption of the OCPP 2.0.1 protocol resulting in more reliable charging networks worldwide.\nOur hope is that anyone looking to bootstrap a modern charging network, or upgrade an existing one from OCPP 1.6 to OCPP 2.0.1, will consider CitrineOS as their starting point, and that increased community involvement will continue to improve the charging experience delivered by this open source project.\nOur main code repository can be found here on GitHub: https://github.com/citrineos/citrineos-core take a look at our GitHub pages site that you can find here: https://citrineos.github.io/</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>During these last two decades, transmission system operators (TSOs) have been facing profound changes such as penetration of renewables, DC networks, redefinition of European market mechanisms leading to major evolutions in the way to operate the electrical transmission grids. The goal of carbon neutrality implies that most of the challenges for TSOs are still to come. All those changes imply drastic changes in the way to perform grid analysis and have appropriate computation modules to perform efficient security assessment.\nLegacy tools are evolving slowly with low information about used approximations. RTE, the French TSO, believes that Open Source is the perfect answer to build power system tools in an efficient, flexible, transparent, and collaborative way. RTE has significantly invested in these Open Source tools and would like to share his experience with demo of tools currently in operation based on PowSyBl framework.</p>",

The project further emphasizes an open-source philosophy, incorporating meaningful documentation and a transparent strategy.</p>\n<p>This presentation will delve into Savoir-faire Linux's experience in replicating a SEAPATH infrastructure in their laboratory. It will provide insights into the architecture of SEAPATH and the essential tools employed for conducting functionnal tests. The tools showcased encompass Precision Time Protocol (PTP) at software level, IEC 61850 Sample Value simulation as well as latency measurements .\nCrucially, this talk aims to communicate the inclusivity of SEAPATH, making it accessible to a broader audience. By eliminating the need for specialized expertise in electrical engineering, SEAPATH opens the door for researchers, mathematicians, and professionals from diverse backgrounds to contribute meaningfully to the project. The presentation will highlight the collaborative potential of SEAPATH, fostering a community where individuals with various skill sets can actively participate in shaping the future of electrical substation virtualization.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>The world has made great progress in providing everyone with access to energy; however, recently, the number of unelectrified people on Earth has increased. Providing access to energy is a critical and complex challenge as most unelectrified people live in extremely remote and hard-to-reach areas, often having limited mobile network connectivity, unknown (future) demand patterns, and extreme weather conditions combined with very low purchasing power of the affected population. \nThe power of Open Source is still completely underrepresented in technological innovations in this sector. We are working towards improving this situation and will showcase one of our flagship examples: An Open Source Battery Management System (BMS) specifically developed for off-grid energy application. Energy storage and its related technologies are key to any off-grid energy application and the Libre Solar BMS has been specially developed for this use case. We will deep dive into the design decisions and features, covering hardware, firmware and an app. The BMS was developed leveraging solely open source tools: The PCB is designed in KiCad, the firmware runs on Zephyr RTOS and the communication interfaces use the ThingSet protocol over various lower layers like Serial, CAN, WebSocket or MQTT. The hardware went through three design iterations and has been lab and field-tested by several organizations.\nWe will conclude and show why this kind of Open Source technology is of such great importance to bring power to the people in both the sense of bringing electricity literally and also creating the grounds for local value creation in the affected geographies. We invite the whole Energy Open Source community to contribute with their efforts to where the contributions can be most impactful on various levels. The Open Source BMS is one great piece, but we need much more of those.</p>",

National grids are no longer independent: every event can have a spill-over effect across the whole continent. Two of the most important consequences are:<br />\n- TSOs can \"pollute\" other TSOs' grids with unnecessary electrical flows, putting a strain on their national grids;<br />\n- Optimizing the cost of grid operation (i.e. of remedial action implementation) is no longer a national problem, but a global one.  </p>\n<p>Thus, it becomes necessary to optimize the operation of the EU grid on a large scale and implement an agreed method to share its costs. \nDeveloping open-source tools to achieve these goals has benefits with robustness, transparency, auditability, and re-usability.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Solar energy is predicted to be the largest form of power generation globally by 2040 and having accurate real-time forecasts is critical to anticipating power production. Unlike fossil fuels, renewable energies are unpredictable in terms of power generation from one hour to the next. In order to balance the grid, operators need an accurate daily estimate of when and how much PV and other renewable energies will be generated. </p>\n<p>Open Climate Fix (OCF) is an open-source (OS) AI company using machine learning (ML) to respond to the need for accurate renewable energy forecasts. Connecting energy industry practitioners with ML researchers doing cutting-edge modelling is our aim, and one way we seek to do this is by making much of our code open-source (https://github.com/openclimatefix). </p>\n<p>In the energy space, OCF’s first focus is on solar nowcasting (short-term forecasting). Our main deep learning model takes in real-time PV data, numeric weather predictions, satellite images, as well as regional grid data, and outputs probabilistic solar electricity nowcasts for solar production systems in the UK. What makes our approach unique is teaching cloud dynamics to the model using satellite data. </p>\n<p>Our 36-hour forecast, Quartz Solar, is currently used by National Grid, the UK grid operator, as a decision-making tool in their control room. Building on this forecast, we are working on a new open-source model, <a href=\"https://github.com/openclimatefix/Open-Source-Quartz-Solar-Forecast\">Quartz Solar OS</a>, that we want everyone (maybe FOSDEM attendees!), not just grid operators, to be able to use. </p>\n<p>The talk OCF proposes will present the ML techniques used to develop Quartz Solar OS and the possible use cases and climate impact such a forecast could have. And yes, we’re hoping to have a demo!</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>The energy transition implies making decisions under deep uncertainties. Modelling is known to be effective in providing the evidence needed to shape the transformation of the energy sector in the most cost-effective way. Open source is a known approach to increase accessibility of the energy modelling tools. That led to a rapid increase in a number of available energy models whose development is mainly driven by the academic community. However, developments have focused on a few world regions, where awareness of climate change is high. There is still a coverage gap, especially for countries where the energy sector is still highly dependent on fossil fuels.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/pypsa-meets-earth/\">PyPSA meets Earth initiative</a> aims to address this gap by building a global community focused on developing an ecosystem of Pythonic tools, including the modelling framework <a href=\"https://github.com/pypsa-meets-earth/pypsa-earth\">PyPSA-Earth</a>. The framework may be utilised to build a ready-to-use regional power system model by extracting all the required data in a workflow orchestrated by Snakemake. A community approach enables the participation of regional experts in the development and brings modelling closer to real-life applications. </p>\n<p>One of the issues found along this route was the lack of ready-to-use tools to integrate the effects of climate change into power system models. A climate development track in PyPSA-Earth addresses this task and aims to implement approaches to account for changes of climate inputs in a physically correct, yet computationally feasible way. To deal with the regional features of national power systems in a systematic way, a country-wise functionality testing has been carried out. As a result, PyPSA-Earth has been adjusted to be fully capable of building a power system model for any country in the world by a single line of code.</p>\n<p>The presentation will give an overview of the challenges encountered along this way and guide trough the use cases of PyPSA-Earth to tackle the challenges of the energy transition around the globe.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Functioning power management is important for the entire spectrum of systems, from embedded to server systems.  However, the presentation is specifically aimed at analyzing the Linux software stack  - inclusive kernel - of embedded products. It shows how embedded Arm64 systems differ from Intel/AMD systems and what impact this has on the power management software design. The presentation gives concrete insights on how to identify wakeups, the impact of scaling governors and many other subsystems of the kernel. The talk is intermixed by numerous practical examples, which should enable the listener to autonomously analyze and optimize the power consumption for complex embedded systems.</p>\n<p>The talk has no prerequisites for the audience. Topics such as scheduling or CPU frequency governors are introduced in the talk. Of course, the listener should have a basic understanding of a Linux system and at least a basic understanding of concepts such as processes and interrupts.</p>\n<p>Even if the talk focuses on an embedded system, the knowledge provided can, with a few exceptions, also be transferred to a server system. So there is no reason for amd64 people to be left out!</p>\n<p>In addition, a new power management kernel analyzer tool will be introduced and its use, which is not yet available in the kernel upstream tree. Further, discussions about a more flexible, eBPF based CPUIdle governor and other research topics are introduced and can be discussed.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Why is digitalization becoming one of the main assets for wind power energy? Wind farms today boast higher capacity factors, indicating that they are producing more energy relative to their installed capacity. Improved design, coupled with advancements in predictive analytics and control systems, have optimized the performance of wind turbines, making them more reliable and productive. The interest in renewable energy and, particularly, in wind power accelerated dramatically as the war in Ukraine took place. For the first time in history the investment in renewables was the primary response to an energy crisis. The increase in wind power capacity involves some new challenges. Older wind turbines are more prone to failure due to aging and at the same time this must be predicted as accurately as possible for the newer ones, based on data collected in real-time in the field. Predictive maintenance can save a lot of time and money by having the right number of spare parts in stock in the right location. Applying DevOps principles to Big Data predictive analytics can help optimize the use of resources and workflows. This produces major improvements to the spare part recommendation based on IoT data. This presentation illustrates how DevOps practices and related Open-Source tools help build an efficient software infrastructure where wind turbines lifetime predictions and spare part stock recommendations are delivered regularly to service engineers.</p>",

Overte closely imitates the WWW, and this brings plenty benefits, but also creates problems other platforms don't have.</p>\n<p>In this talk, I will explain what makes us different, what the benefits are to doing things our way, how do we solve problems other systems don't have, and why you might want to try Overte for its unique approach.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>This talk presents Kùzu: a new open-sourced graph database management system (GDBMS) that is designed for graph data science (GDS) eco-system, specifically in Python. GDS applications require a series of data processing steps, such as extracting data from tabular sources into a graph of nodes and relationships, cleaning and transforming the graph, extracting node features, and finally moving data into a GDS package, such as NetworkX and PyTorch Geometric for graph analytics. These steps can be performed easily and efficiently by GDBMSs, which provide high-level graph-based data models and query languages to developers. Kùzu is a GDBMS designed to serve as an essential storage system for GDS developers.</p>\n<p>Kùzu's embedded architecture makes it very easy to import as a library without a server setup and also provides performance advantages. Specifically users can: (i) ingest and model their application records in various raw file formats, such as Parquet or in-memory Pandas DataFrames, as a graph; (ii) query and transform these graphs using Cypher query language; and (iii) export graphs into popular Python GDS packages like NetworkX and PyTorch Geometric with no copy cost.</p>\n<p>The talk is tailored for data scientists and engineers. We will briefly provide the necessary background on graph analytics. We'll briefly walk through code examples showcasing how Kùzu makes developing GDS pipelines easier, via its integrations with the PyData ecosystem.</p>",

The plugin makes it possible to use pytest to perform tests on containers and software inside containers. You don’t have to take care of pulling images, building them, or picking ports on the host. You just describe your container setup and pass it to a test function. In return, the plugin gives you a connection to the container. Using the connection, you can verify the container’s state using the testinfra python framework. The plugin even cleans up after itself when you’re done.</p>\n<p>In short, <code>pytest_container</code> makes it possible to write tests in Python: no need to build your own framework from scratch or worry about the boring container plumbing tasks.</p>\n<p>Join this talk to see <code>pytest_container</code> in action and learn how it can make your life easier!</p>",

    "url": "https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/event/fosdem-2024-2848-documenting-and-fixing-non-reproducible-builds-due-to-configuration-options/",
    "abstract": "<p>A critical aspect of software development, build reproducibility, ensures the\ndependability, security, and maintainability of software systems. Although\nseveral factors, including the build environment, have been investigated in the\ncontext of non-reproducible builds, to the best of our knowledge the precise\ninfluence of configuration options in configurable systems has not been\nthoroughly investigated.  This presentation aims at filling this gap.  This\npresentation thus proposes an approach for the automatic identification of\nconfiguration options causing non-reproducibility of builds. It begins by\nbuilding a set of builds in order to detect non-reproducible ones through binary\ncomparison. We then develop automated techniques that combine statistical\nlearning with symbolic reasoning to analyze over 20,000 configuration\noptions. Our methods are designed to both detect options causing\nnon-reproducibility, and remedy non-reproducible configurations, two tasks that\nare challenging and costly to perform manually.  We evaluate our approach on\nthree case studies, namely Toybox, Busybox, and Linux, analyzing more than 2,000\nconfigurations for each of them. Toybox and Busybox come exempt from\nnon-reproducibility. In contrast, 47% of Linux configurations lead to\nnon-reproducible builds. The approach we propose in this presentation is capable\nof identifying 10 configuration options that caused this\nnon-reproducibility. When confronted to the Linux documentation, none of these\nare documented as non-reproducible. Thus, our identified non-reproducible\nconfiguration options are novel knowledge and constitutes a direct, actionable\ninformation improvement for the Linux community. Finally, we demonstrate that\nour methodology effectively identifies a set of undesirable option values,\nenabling the enhancement and expansion of the Linux kernel documentation while\nautomatically rectifying 96% of encountered non-reproducible builds.</p>",

This lightning talk will break down the essential aspects of platform engineering in a clear and concise way, making it accessible even for \"dummies.\"</p>\n<p>We'll explore the three pillars of platform engineering:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Platform Operations (SRE): Learn how platform engineers leverage Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) principles to ensure the platform's performance, scalability, and reliability. Discover how they automate tasks, monitor systems, and handle incidents, freeing up developers to focus on building amazing products.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Platform as Product: Imagine your platform as a product itself, not just infrastructure. We'll dive into how platform engineers design and build a self-service platform that caters to developers' needs. Think single pane of glass management, easy provisioning, and seamless integration with existing workflows.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Self-Service for Developers (IDPs): Forget the days of waiting for infrastructure or services. Platform engineering empowers developers with Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs). These tools give them the autonomy to provision resources, deploy applications, and manage their environments with minimal friction.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>By the end of this talk, you'll understand the power of platform engineering and its potential to revolutionize your software development process. You'll be equipped with key takeaways and resources to explore further, even if you're starting from scratch.

Initiated in 2015 through a collaborative effort between Ruby for Good and the Portland Diaper Bank, this Digital Public Good (DPG) has achieved remarkable growth without employing any paid staff. Expanding its reach to hundreds of essentials banks and thousands of nonprofit partners across North America, human-essentials now plays a crucial role in supporting over 3 million children and 500,000 period supply recipients annually. Remarkably, this success has been driven by the contributions of nearly 300 volunteers.</p>\n<p>Join us to uncover the secrets behind this project’s success. Learn about the innovative strategies and community-driven approaches that have enabled human-essentials to defy expectations and thrive as a sustainable open source software project.</p>",

Orthanc, a free and open-source, lightweight, and extensible software, has emerged as a recognized solution for medical imaging data management.</p>\n<p>Orthanc serves as a vendor-neutral archive, facilitating the cost-effective storage, retrieval, and sharing of various imaging modalities, including X-ray, MRI, CT scans, and more. Its modular design allows seamless integration into existing healthcare systems. Orthanc's compliance with the DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) and DICOMweb interoperability standards ensures compatibility across different imaging devices and platforms, fostering collaborative research and multidisciplinary healthcare approaches.</p>\n<p>Key features of Orthanc include its user-friendly interface, scalability, and support for advanced functionalities like de-identification and encryption, ensuring patient data security and privacy compliance. Multiple Web viewers are integrated into Orthanc, such as OHIF, Kitware VolView, and the Stone Web viewer. Orthanc also comes with a REST API that can be used to script imaging workflows, which is widely used to set up auto-routing between local DICOM servers or between remote sites. Furthermore, its ability to incorporate machine learning algorithms for image analysis and processing opens avenues for automated diagnosis, treatment planning, and research advancements.</p>\n<p>Digital Public Goods Alliance recognized Orthanc as a digital public good in August 2023. This underscores the commitment of the Orthanc community to contribute to Sustainable Development Goals 3 and 9 (health, innovation, infrastructure).</p>\n<p>In conclusion, Orthanc stands as a robust, versatile, and adaptable software solution for the efficient management and utilization of medical imaging data. Its accessibility, interoperability, and capacity for customization position Orthanc as a valuable asset in advancing medical research, clinical workflows, and ultimately improving patient care outcomes.</p>\n<p>Homepage of the Orthanc project: https://orthanc.uclouvain.be/\nSource code: https://orthanc.uclouvain.be/hg/</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>There is an increasing trend of packaging and sharing tools in the epidemiology research community. But these tools remain difficult to use and to integrate in a data analysis pipeline. There is a need for a more integrated approach, ensuring that the various tools work well with one another. For example, minimal data wrangling should be needed to transform the output of one tool before passing it to the next tool down the data analysis pipeline. Similarly, various alternatives for a single step of the pipeline should as much as possible use the same inputs and return the same outputs. In this talk, I will present how the Epiverse-TRACE project collaborates with many R package developers in epidemiology to integrate their tools in a unified universe. Indeed, the unique and challenging feature of Epiverse is that it doesn’t intend to create a unified universe from scratch, but instead aims at updating existing external pieces of software to better work together. This talk will explain how we identify the key parts that should be updated, and how we make these updates with minimal disruption to the individual package developers and established community of users.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Thanks to EU and French state founding, SNCF Réseau, the French Railway Infrastructure Manager start to develop an open source project (www.osrd.fr) with 40 peoples. But SNCF Réseau's challenge is to keep pace with the decarbonization of transport, and thus ensure more traffic, by optimizing infrastructure investments. If we want to be competitive with air and road, we need to have the most efficient railway system. These investments require long studies, simulation tool to design the right infrastructure delivering the expected services. This challenge is shared by all the infrastructure managers and the tools different and closed. \nWe decided to propose a commun tool to improve the quality of the studies and the transparency of the usage of public money both for the software and the infrastructure. Collaboration with other infrastructure manager around OSRD is already planned to add value in the software but also in the business. Here is our Github: https://github.com/osrd-project</p>",

The many clients and servers need to interoperate with each other. A database of implementations and supported features will make testing easier. A little coordination between clients and servers, to reach critical mass, can be helpful at times as well.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>OpenAPI Specification is a machine and human readable way to describe APIs, from endpoints to examples. From these descriptions we can generate documentation, create libraries, and ensure that our users know exactly what to expect from our APIs. This talk introduces you to the OpenAPI standard, showing how to describe APIs and looking at some popular API examples. Good tools are essential so we'll look at some of the open source tools available to working with OpenAPI easier. We'll cover the benefits of using an open standard to describe your APIs and discuss what you can do next, like publishing documentation, generating code, and teaching LLMs new tricks. Learn about what's coming up in the world of OpenAPI, and how to get involved with this open standard and its community.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>The shell is quite an old piece of software. Old in a good way: it has been tested and upgraded to match a level of quality that allows for efficient work. But if you use the command line, you would most certainly benefit from using a good prompt system instead of the default one, because it will help you make sense of the state of your workflow.\nAmong modern prompt systems, Liquid Prompt is the older one, surely the one with the best feature set, and probably the one having thought the most of about its design.\nThis presentation will introduce the why and how of the \"Dotmatrix\" theme for Liquid Prompt, which drastically rethink how information is displayed to the user. It will discuss the impact on UX of accessibility, the ANSI color space, information significance and text-oriented visual grammar(s).</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>There's little love for design and UX in many security-related FOSS projects. After all, why should anyone care about the looks of something created (mostly) for expert users? As long as it works, the user interface is not really important, isn’t it? Designers will often answer with indignation, appeal to possible wider audiences, or just give up on arguing with the hackers. However, bad UX is bad not just for the so-called \"normal people\". Even the experts are human, and as humans are susceptible to cognitive biases and mistakes; and while privacy and security are great, they are even better when available widely and comfortably, so that their users are not obviously recognizable as \"people with something to hide\".</p>\n<p>For the last several years, I have been working on improving the UX of Qubes OS, a security-focused operating system. In this talk, I will share the insights this work brought me on how improving UX can lead to better security, discuss how user research methods can be used to improve not just the feel of the software, but also its security, and discuss insights from cognitive psychology that can help us create more secure designs.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.qubes-os.org/\">Qubes OS website</a>\n<a href=\"https://prototypefund.de/en/security-vs-usability/\">My article on security and usability</a></p>",

We explore disciplines that provide language support, privacy, data protection, security, and safety for the disability community. This talk relates to everyone involved in the design of digital technologies which includes standards, policies, applications, and more. Technology designers from different disciplines are increasingly confronted with the topic of accessibility for people with disabilities, yet are often unsure how to approach it. Sensitivities often prevent efficient interaction among designers from different disciplines. This workshop is open to all - designers, developers, digital rights activists, usability consultants, and accessibility consultants. One does not require specific expertise to participate. People with backgrounds in collecting feedback from users and open-source tool teams who have integrated and implemented usability and accessibility improvements based on user feedback are welcome. </p>\n<p>The talk will share best practices and resources that comply with accessibility best practices and how one can achieve the desirable accessibility standard. The talk will also share the results or examples of feedback collected from people with disabilities, outlining specific gaps in the accessibility of current open-source tools such as BigBlueButton, Jitsi, RiseUp Pad, Crypto Pad, Tella, Destiny, CDR Link, Círculo, etc.</p>\n<p>Participants will have a </p>\n<p>Participants will also have a 1) Comprehensive understanding of the accessibility status of popular open-source tools by learning about the common accessibility myths. </p>\n<p>2) Understand the dire need for adopting accessibility standards to foster digital inclusion for people with disabilities.</p>\n<p>3) The socio-economic benefits of  making privacy and security tools more accessible by incorporating principles of web-accessibility.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>In this talk I'll share lessons learned over years spent as a program manager and product manager contributing to open source projects, mostly in the cloud native space. I'll explain how backlog refinement, prioritization, roadmapping, user research and data collection, and project management basics can help your project stand out as uniquely valuable in a crowded landscape—drawing from real-world examples. To help you gain clarity on your project's goals and core attributes, I'll talk about how to overcome \"assumption-driven development\" to become a better listener to your users. Throughout, I'll also show you how incorporating product management methods can help you to avoid frustration and burnout, whether you're a maintainer or a contributor. </p>\n<p>This talk will provide an overview of select techniques used by product managers to drive decision-making, focus, and results-oriented experimentation. These techniques will be presented in a manner that takes into consideration the realities and practicalities of trying to achieve development goals in the open source context. For those of you working in open source as part of your day jobs, I'll also discuss how to align your project's delivery objectives with your employer's product roadmap so that you increase the chances of getting the staffing, support, and recognition you want.</p>\n<p>By the end, you will hopefully take away new knowledge and insights into how to tame your backlog, surface your core objectives and problems to be solved, make your users happier, and keep yourselves—and your fellow contributors—productive with purpose.</p>",

Things are slowly changing: publication of so-called \"artifacts\" are encouraged by journals and conferences. However, releasing scripts and programs used for experiments can be challenging: how to organize the material? how to clearly document the instructions? how to ensure reproducibility of the experiments? how to ensure long-term availability? Several answers are possible to all these questions. In this talk, I will try to summarize how and why my methodology to build reproducible artifacts evolved over several years in the research area.</p>",

This tool uses real-time carbon intensity data from the UK's National Grid ESO via their API to estimate the carbon intensity of the electricity grid, and schedules tasks at times when the estimated carbon intensity is lowest. This helps to reduce the carbon emissions associated with running computationally intensive tasks, making it an ideal solution for environmentally conscious developers. Currently CATS is built to work with the simple \"at\" scheduler, but work is underway to port it to Slurm. \nThe source code can be found at https://github.com/GreenScheduler/cats and more information at https://greenscheduler.github.io/cats/.</p>",

Wi4MPI translates the ABI dynamically from the MPI library used to build the application to a different MPI library available at run time. With Wi4MPI, HPC practitioners can break the portability barrier imposed by ABI incompatibility, potentially increase performance, and increase user productivity. This presentation is broken down in three components: (1) Understanding ABI compatibility in MPI; (2) Translating MPI libraries dynamically; and (3) Applying dynamic translation to key use cases in HPC, including Containers.</p>",

Given the desire for portability of applications, OpenMP offloading is a popular way to accelerate applications on GPUs.</p>\n<p>This talk presents the ROCm OpenMP offloading compiler from two perspectives: compiler flags and compiler/runtime implementation. Given that it may be critical to use the right compiler flags, the talk presents some of the tuning knobs that the ROCm OpenMP compiler exposes to users. It will go into more detail of what optimization, feature, and parameter the specific compiler flags enable. For each of the compiler flags listed, the talk will present information on what occurs in the compiler and the runtime library. For several of these switches, the talk presents performance results.</p>\n<p>In particular, the talk covers the high-level flag <code>-fopenmp-target-fast</code> and what optimizations are enabled by that switch. It will then go into more detail about the specific flags for the selected underlying optimizations and their user-facing parameter options that allow for fine-tuning in certain scenarios. Specifically, the talk covers the following flags:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>-fopenmp-gpu-threads-per-team</code>: This switch controls kernel launch parameters considered during the compiler’s code generation phase, which can impact things like register allocation.</li>\n<li><code>-fopenmp-target-big-jump-loop</code>: This switch enables a more optimized form of loops for running on the GPU that is closer to traditional block-languages like CUDA or HIP.</li>\n<li><code>-fopenmp-target-no-loop</code>: This switch enables the generation of CUDA-like code without any loop executed on the device. The talk outlines which conditions must be met to allow the compiler to generate such GPU code.</li>\n<li><code>-fopenmp-target-xteam-reductions</code>: A special form of reduction kernels that can greatly benefit the performance of reductions. One of its main tuning knobs is the blocksize.</li>\n<li><code>-fopenmp-target-xteam-reduction-blocksize</code>: The xteam reductions blocksize and what are the implications.</li>\n<li><code>-fopenmp-force-usm</code>: This flag is a convenient switch that enables the compiler to emit code as if the user specified <code>#pragma omp unified_shared_memory</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition to the compiler flags, the runtime offers additional configurability via environment variables. Some of these variables influence the very same mechanisms, whereas other provide separate mechanisms. The talk gives an overview of some of these variables and how they influence execution.</p>\n<p>The repositories can be found at https://github.com/ROCm.

    "abstract": "<p>When procuring new hardware for an HPC system, the hardware vendors can be provided with targets to hit. This can either be performance per dollar but more recently also includes metrics like performance per watt. Industry standard benchmarks like <a href=\"https://www.top500.org/project/linpack/\">Linpack</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cs.virginia.edu/stream/\">Stream</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.spec.org/benchmarks.html\">Spec</a> are not necessarily representative for the jobs that will actually run on the system and their predicted performance per dollar or watt might not be accurate when users run their tasks on the system. At the association for national high performance computing (<a href=\"https://www.nhr-verein.de/\">NHR</a>) we are developing a pipeline to generate a representative benchmark collection from an observed job mix to provide to hardware vendors. One essential step is the so called mini-app extraction. A mini-app is a standalone kernel of a given HPC application, making it significantly smaller in terms of lines of code but retaining the computational characteristic of the original application. Based on these mini-apps vendors can better suite there hardware offerings to the expected use. As mini-apps usually need to be crafted manually by domain experts, we are developing <a href=\"https://git.rwth-aachen.de/tim.heldmann/CTUApex\">Mini-Apex</a>. Mini-Apex is an open source compiler tool based on Clang, able to help extract mini-apps from C and C++ applications. It uses a <a href=\"https://github.com/tudasc/MetaCG\">MetaCG</a> to generate a call-graph with attached analysis results, and <a href=\"https://github.com/tudasc/PIRA\">PIRA</a> to identify the kernel.\nIt then extract the kernel-function, as well as all necessary sub-routines, variables, classes, structs, and definitions into a mini-app, reusing most of the build system of the original application.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>The talk will outline the technical lessons learned in development of the <a href=\"https://pypi.org/p/PyPartMC\">PyPartMC project</a>. The key goal of PyPartMC is to provide a maintainable multi-platform pip-installable package enabling interoperability between the Python ecosystem and the internal components of PartMC – an open-source aerosol dynamics simulation package. The wrapped <a href=\"https://lagrange.mechse.illinois.edu/partmc\">PartMC package</a> has been in active development for almost two decades and is used in computational research ranging from process studies on ice formation in clouds to large-scale simulations of air pollution evolution coupled with weather forecasting models. PartMC has a modular, test-covered, pseudo-OOP, Fortran 90 codebase; several C and Fortran dependencies (SUNDIALS, MPI, netCDF, SuiteSparse, ...); and a bespoke config-file subsystem supporting nested files for variable-size input.</p>\n<p>Developing PyPartMC, we aim to provide added value to both the existing community of PartMC users, accustomed to the Fortran/HPC ecosystem, as well as to a wider community potentially daunted by the entry threshold pertinent to the multiple steps needed to obtain, compile, setup and run PartMC, and analyse its output. Steps which so far involved usage of diverse tools and languages, and which are meant to be achievable in a single computational research environment such as Python, Julia or Matlab. </p>\n<p>To this end, PyPartMC is available at pypi.org in form of both source (with all 10+ dependencies in git submodules) as well as binary packages (Linux, Windows and macOS). Binary packages have all the dependencies statically linked, what is orchestrated using CMake via standard wheel-building logic. The design features: (i) employment of unmodified Fortran code of the wrapped PartMC package; (ii) binding logic implemented in C++ using pybind11; (iii) garbage collection of Fortran derived type instances; (iv) a drop-in i/o layer replacement matching the Fortran config-file subsystem API, which C++ sees as nlohmann::json objects, and which quacks like ordinary dicts from Python perspective. On top of that, a thorough test coverage including Github-Actions-hooked checks for interoperability with Matlab's built-in Python bridge and with Julia (using PyCall.jl).</p>\n<p>For more information, see: <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.softx.2023.101613\">D'Aquino et al. 2023</a></p>",

    "abstract": "<p>In today's fast-paced business environment, and especially with the advent of machine learning (ML),  organizations are seeking ways to derive better insights from their data as quickly as possible. However, implementing a complete ML pipeline can be quite challenging. It’s even harder if you want to process newly arrived data immediately or you have a legacy system which is not easy to connect with your modern infrastructure . Change Data Capture (CDC) has emerged as a technology for delivering real-time data changes from various sources, especially from the databases. In this talk we will introduce <a href=\"https://debezium.io/\">Debezium</a>, a leading open source framework for CDC. We will discuss how it can be leveraged for ingesting data from the various databases into ML frameworks like TensorFlow and what the pitfalls are if you go this route.</p>\n<p>Attendees will gain an understanding of how Debezium CDC works, how it can help them to ingest data from the source database into the ML framework in real time and also what are the possible challenges with this approach.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Apptainer, an open-source containerization software built for HPC and used by over 25,000 computing sites worldwide, entered the Linux Foundation about two years ago. This was accompanied by a rebasing in version and a fresh roadmap of features for the software project moving forward. A significant amount of development has happened both on these features and on methods of utilizing Apptainer itself for greater efficiency in HPC since this changeover. This talk will explain these developments, including new support for fully rootless builds and installs of Apptainer, ways Apptainer now leverages the Linux user namespace for some of its features, innovations in using Apptainers with MPI and fabric adaptors, and the usefulness of ORAS protocol in software supply chain management and its current state of integration with OCI registries.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.apptainer.org\">Apptainer Website</a>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/apptainer/apptainer\">Apptainer GitHub</a></p>",

The semantic information can be used to drive workflows. The storage and retrieval of data can be optimized and specialised based on data semantics for different workflows.</p>\n<p>DASI (Data Access and Storage Interface) is a semantically-driven data store developed by ECMWF as part of the EuroHPC project IO-SEA. Based on the FDB object store library developed and in operational use at ECMWF, DASI manages data using its domain specific and scientifically meaningful metadata keys, and separates data management from the underlying backend storage technologies. This allows very fast and efficient algorithms to search for and retrieve data (based on its semantic meaning) from large datasets. DASI is modular and is compatible with multiple backends (e.g., POSIX, CEPH, DAOS) through a diverse API (Python, C++, C). We will explain the concept of semantic description of data and demonstrate DASI as a data management solution.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>The high performance computing (HPC) community has an often tumultuous relationship with cloud, with advocates from both sides facing off in a West Side Story style fight. The costs, historical lack of focus on performance, and lack of transparency about supply of cloud resources is problematic. The lack of consistent, automated orchestration on HPC poses challenges for running complex emerging workflows. Cloud is growing rapidly and is projected to be the largest sector of computing by revenue 2025. Cloud's market-favored position makes it a primary source and beneficiary of innovations, allowing it to address limitations of HPC. HPC needs a strategy for integrating cloud technologies and collaborating with the cloud community. If our HPC community cannot successfully integrate cloud technologies and techniques we (and our science) will be left behind. </p>\n<p>To establish this foundation the community must adopt a new strategy - converged computing, or creating environments and technologies that combine the best of both worlds. In this talk I will discuss our innovative work toward this goal – implementing HPC technologies inside of Kubernetes, the de-facto standard workload orchestration framework, and Kubernetes inside of HPC. I will provide a brief history of our early work, including improving the default Kubernetes scheduler by way of testing more sophisticated graph-based scheduling (a project called Fluence), and implementing the entirety of an HPC workload manager inside of Kubernetes (the Flux Operator). Finally, I present the ultimate turducken - allowing for running machine learning and HPC applications (including the Flux Operator itself) inside of Kubernetes, inside of Flux. With this approach, we imagine a collaborative future where HPC users can deploy workloads seamlessly across environments, and encounter equality of automation and performance. </p>\n<p>LLNL-PRES-859106</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>In 2023, Red Hat changed how it handles Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) source code. The source code for RHEL spent many years being released for free as CentOS Linux, but is now only available through the Red Hat customer interface, limiting access to those who commit to following its user agreements. Those user agreements then limit the use and redistribution of that code. The situation is complicated: While Red Hat claims this is compliant with open source definitions, some NGOs and OSS opinions differ.</p>\n<p>At the same time, we see an expansion of the adoption of open core, and even gatherings of opencore supporters at their own events (https://opencoresummit.com/). Organized by investment capital firms (https://oss.capital/) and defining \"COSS\" (commercial open source software) as the best OSS ever, these events celebrate a disruptive and highly commercial approach to open source. More and more companies are adopting the open core model with varying degrees of success, while Amazon and other companies are moving away from companies using the open core model, embracing \"truly free\" software.</p>\n<p>One thing is for sure: many of the companies adopting open core model  have very effective legal departments and a lot of experience. But how should we - the open source community handle this? Many of us volunteer for open source projects, and the very lucky ones are employed to work on open source projects, but that, too, can bring in a competing motivation. </p>\n<p>From open source projects that are backed by commercial companies needing to provide value to continue to receive the very real funding the projects need, to projects with no commercial backing and massive contributor communities, the answer is likely to be nuanced. How do we ensure the success and continued adoption of open source philosophies while finding a way to call out and de-incentivize openwashing?</p>\n<p>Host: \n    Markus Feilner, Open Source Journalist \nPanel: \n    Liam Proven, (The Register), author of many articles on the topic \n    Karen Sandler, Executive Director, Free Software Conservancy \n    benny Vasquez, Chair, Board of Directors @AlmaLinux OS Foundation</p>",

FLOSS was born out of a desire for a new arrangement of copyright. This has been very successful and ample information and support exists for contributors and projects. Software patents have been discussed extensively, and, well, there is an uneasy stalemate(?). Trademarks have, in my experience, not received the same amount of attention.</p>\n<p>In the PostgreSQL project, we have for several years now worked to sort out how to deal with trademark issues, what and how to register, what uses to allow, how to allow them, and we have dealt with some unfortunate and tiresome conflicts. The PostgreSQL project is not sponsored by a single company or association, which makes all of this even more complicated. We had to figure a lot of this out on our own (with legal help), and there was not the same wealth of information available like for example for copyright. I want to share our experiences, get some feedback, and make some suggestions to the wider community about what kinds of resources would be (or would have been) useful.</p>",

We will see that the courts were only asked and only ordered that the defendant may not distribute the GPLed software in a GPL-violating way. This leaves one wondering whether the courts would order a defendant to no longer distribute the software at issue at all. This question essentially goes to section 4 of the GPLv2; the so called termination clause. A look into the German Civil Code (sect. 534) reveals us that such automatic termination clauses have to be read as rescission clauses (i.e. as manual termination). We will then look at the sections of the Civil Code which deals with rescission in generally and learn about the separation principle. The talk will conclude with a summary what the copyright holder faced with GPL-violations best does under German law.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>The Swiss Parliament passed a new law in March 2023 that requires federal government agencies to publish all government software under an open source license. The new \"Federal Law on the Use of Electronic Means for the Fulfillment of Official Tasks\" (EMBAG, Article 9 \"Open Source Software\" https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/fga/2023/787/de) went into effect on January 1, 2024. It is the result of 12 years of lobbying by the Swiss Parliamentary Group for Digital Sustainability to ensure that the law not only allows governments to publish open source code, but actually makes it the default process (https://www.ti8m.com/en/blog/open-source-gesetz-schweiz).\nThe presentation will outline the history of the legislative process and present the current open source activities of Swiss government agencies, also in the context of the ongoing political debate on digital sovereignty (https://www.inside-it.ch/lasst-uns-die-digitale-souveraenitaet-nicht-verschlafen). The subsequent discussion will focus on what the Swiss government should do next to successfully implement the law. Suggestions such as establishing an Open Source Programme Office (OSPO) like the EU and launching a national Open Source development platform like OpenCoDE in Germany are on the table. More input is needed since Switzerland lacks a strong open source culture compared to other European countries.</p>",

Do we need to develop something or maybe we just need to have a specific OS image configuration to enjoy the benefits? The talk will try to answer these questions and explain the differences in the design of the various CVM instance types and discuss the current state of development of various important component upstream as well as their integration in general purpose Linux distributions (Fedora, CentOS Stream, RHEL). Focusing on providing confidentiality of the data at rest, existing technologies providing boot time integrity (SecureBoot, Measured boot, vTPMs,...) will be discussed.

    "abstract": "<p>As organizations increasingly shift towards hybrid cloud, many are expected to face the following challenge: how to migrate virtual workloads from traditional virtualization platforms, like vSphere, oVirt or OpenStack, to a hybrid cloud solution, like OKD? There are a variety of strategies and tools available for such a transition to choose from. In this session, we will see one of these strategies, in which workloads keep running in virtual machines alongside containers on top of OKD, based on our recent experience in migrating real-world virtual machines from oVirt to KubeVirt using Forklift.</p>\n<p>In mid-2023, our engineering team at Red Hat took the task of migrating all the virtual machines from an internal oVirt environment to a new OKD deployment. Our oVirt environment was in use for more than a decade, running hundreds of production VMs as well as VMs for development purposes. Given the nature of the workloads, it was impractical, and in some cases not even possible, to containerize the workloads. Therefore, we decided to go ahead and take Forklift for a spin, and move the VMs to run on OKD using KubeVirt, with minimal changes to the workloads that run inside them.</p>\n<p>At first glance, this kind of migration appears fairly straightforward, doesn't it? Especially considering we now have access to mature tools for VM migrations, like virt-v2v and ovirt-imageio, that are orchestrated by the Forklift operator. And specifically, when migrating from oVirt to KubeVirt, the same virtualization stack is used on both ends. However, in reality, the migration process was more complex than anticipated, with quite a few factors to consider and operations that were needed to complement the functionality in Forklift.</p>\n<p>This session presents tips and insights for migrations from legacy virtualization platforms to OKD, through our test case of transitioning from oVirt to OKD using Forklift. Without assuming prior knowledge of the platforms and tools discussed, we will cover the entire migration process using Forklift, and explain scripts we implemented and strategies we used for a smooth transition to OKD. Join us to learn from our journey, so by the end of this session you will have a clear understanding of the necessary steps to successfully execute your organization's transition projects.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>In automotive, Android guests are currently used for deploying infotainment systems. To support Android as a guest, the Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM) requires a set of virtual hardware like sound, video and networking. In this context, VirtIO has spreaded as a standard interface for virtual devices. Having VirtIO for hardware allows Android to be deployed in different VMMs that support VirtIO like Crosvm or QEMU. This talk presents the current efforts to implement virtio-sound for infotainment systems in automotive. The implementation of virtio-sound can be split into two: the device or backend and the driver or the frontend. Generally speaking, the driver runs in the guest OS and it is not different from other sound drivers. The sound driver exposes an API to the user-application in guest and then communicates to the device to serve those requests like playing a sound or recording audio. The device usually runs in the host and processes the requests that come from the driver. There are different ways to implement the device, e.g., as a built-in device in QEMU, using vhost or vhost-user. In this talk, we talk about our decision to implement virtio-sound as an vhost-user device. In this case, the device runs in the host machine as a separate process independent of the QEMU process. This deployment has benefits like reducing the attack surface of QEMU and also enables more granularity in setting up rights for the device process. Our implementation is able to handle different audio backends by relying on a generic interface. Currently, we support the pipewire and Alsa as audio backends. During this presentation, we propose to share our journey in building the virtio-sound device, including improving its specification, fixing bugs in the virtio-sound driver, and building it as a rust-vmm project. We also plan to outline a roadmap for the future like adding support for other audio backends like Gstreamer.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>OCI (OpenStack Cluster Installer) is a software to provision an OpenStack clusters automatically. This package installs a provisioning machine, which uses the below components:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>DHCP server (isc-dhcp-server)</li>\n<li>PXE boot server (tftp-hpa)</li>\n<li>web server (apache2)</li>\n<li>puppet-master</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Once computers in the cluster boot for the first time, a Debian live system is served by OCI over PXE, to act as a discovery image. This live system then reports the hardware features back to OCI. Computers can then be installed with Debian from that live system, configured with a puppet-agent that will connect\nto the puppet-master of OCI. After Debian is installed, the server reboots, and OpenStack services are provisioned, depending on the server role in the cluster.</p>\n<p>OCI is fully packaged in Debian, including all of the Puppet modules. After installing the OCI package and its dependencies, no other artificat needs to be installed on your provisioning server, meaning that if a local debian mirror is available, the OpenStack cluster installation can be done completely\noffline.\nThis presentation will introduce OpenStack Cluster Installer, and explain how it works, its general principle, and why it's a very good solution to manage your OpenStack deployment on Debian.</p>\n<p>See details of the project here:\nhttps://salsa.debian.org/openstack-team/debian/openstack-cluster-installer</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Biosbits is a software written by Josh Triplett that executes the bios components such as acpi/smbios tables directly from grub without an operating system involved in between. In QEMU, we never had the ability to directly execute and test ACPI/SMBIOS tables from within a running guest. This work adds the ability to test QEMU generated acpi tables using biosbits. We can add new tests incrementally.\nFor QEMU, we maintain a fork of bios bits in gitlab containing numerous fixes along with all the dependent submodules. Within the QEMU repo, we add new python based avocado tests for bits. Care has been taken so that an ACPI contributor can add new tests for bits without having to know too much about biosbits itself or even touching the biosbits repository.\nThis test framework is available from QEMU v7.2. The talk will give some details on the bios bits avocado tests, how to execute them, how to add new tests etc. It will discuss some of the challenges and limitations of this framework.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>What if you need to connect your Kubernetes workloads to a physical network, or more than one network?  You can attach multiple network interfaces using Multus, but you'll need to specify every detail. </p>\n<p>Virtualized workloads have extra requirements from the network, given their stateful nature. For instance, they require their IP addresses to be preserved during their life-cycle, and also during live migration. Currently, since the network does not provide these features, the network-admin must deploy and configure extra services in the network. </p>\n<p>But, what if you had a SDN (software defined network) to take care of that, and while doing so abstract how to bridge hybrid infrastructure, from bare metal, to virtualized, to public cloud environments? </p>\n<p>Join us to learn and understand how these features can be used to provide Kubernetes workloads access to physical networks (protected by network policies)  through a live demo.\nThe multi-network feature is paramount to delivering non-cloud deployments with enough flexibility for their use cases: connecting to the physical networks of their data-centers is extremely important, since some of their services are not deployed in Kubernetes. For security reasons, access to/from the workloads running in Kubernetes should be governed by network policies. OVN-K multi-networking also provides an opinionated network fabric that can automate what users previously had to specify in detail, simplifying configuration and cost of operation for cloud providers and admins.</p>\n<p>While any pod will benefit from the above, KubeVirt workloads (VMs) will get more juice out of this SDN implementation. While the feature-set available today is good enough to allow users of traditional virtualization platforms to lift-and-shift their existing workloads into KubeVirt, the features in the pipeline are game changers: VM workloads requires things from the network a pod wouldn’t normally ask for, such as preserving the IP during its life cycle, and also during migration (so the established TCP connection can survive being moved to a different Kubernetes node). These features are a really good match for OVN-Kubernetes since OVN already provides some migration-centered improvements used on other platforms (i.e. Openstack) which can be re-used to provide seamless live-migration of the VM workloads.</p>",

However, other parts of the kernel and user-space components lack proper mechanisms for adjusting. This can lead to functional issues, e.g. two VMs in the same network with the same network configuration, as well as security concerns, e.g. two user-space CSPRNGs returning identical \"random\" streams of bits.</p>\n<p>In this talk we will describe the snapshot safety problem and speak about existing mechanisms for tackling it and our efforts to extend those.

    "abstract": "<p>Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations (AIOps) has emerged as a new model for automating and streamlining operating operational workflow in large-scale IT infrastructures using AI-supported methods and tools on different levels. AIOps platforms can collect and aggregate the increasing volumes of data generated by multiple IT infrastructure components, provide real-time monitoring and analysis of cloud and edge resources, detect significant events and patterns related to application performance and availability before they become critical, and even in some cases automatically resolve these issues without human intervention. </p>\n<p>Based on these concepts, our presentation will introduce a new experimental AIOps framework developed in OpenNebula and its Prometheus integration for the evaluation of AI techniques in order to provide intelligent workload forecasting and infrastructure orchestration capabilities to automate and optimize the provisioning and deployment of geographically distributed edge/cloud infrastructures and applications. We will also present the results of the evaluation of AI-based time series forecasting techniques to predict the CPU usage of VMs, and optimization techniques for the placement of VMs on top of the physical infrastructure, based on CPU usage predictions.</p>",

Isn’t it a chicken and egg situation? What exactly happens with the network traffic inside a Kubernetes cluster? Which host interfaces are used by Kubernetes? Where to look to troubleshoot network issues with your workload? Last but not least, how to make your network lightning fast?</p>\n<p>In this session we will explain everything you need to understand how on-prem networking works. Loadbalancers, DNS, whatever you need. We will give you a simple way to deploy your workload, even on the most complex topologies.</p>\n<p>To make it more entertaining, we will demo a cluster running on a platform that ultimately broke our understanding of what on-prem and what a cloud is, putting a question mark on some fundamental definitions.

    "abstract": "<p>Kubernetes is increasingly being used for mission critical applications where uptime and data protection are of primary importance.  Virtual machines run alongside containers thanks to the KubeVirt project.  When disaster strikes one data center, you can recover by failing over to another data center.  The RamenDR project handles data protection and orchestrates disaster recovery flows for containers and VMs alike.  All of this is powered by open source projects and many contributors.  But how can you develop and test a complex software stack that is designed to run on multiple racks of hardware in a data center?</p>\n<p>In this talk we introduce a virtual machine disaster recovery software stack that runs on three Kubernetes clusters.  We will demonstrate a disaster scenario using a tool, drenv, which can create a multi-cluster environment including Rook Ceph storage, KubeVirt, and RamenDR on your laptop with one simple command.  Attend this talk if you: are interested in complex Kubernetes environments, want to learn how drenv can help your project, or if you like watching risky live demos at conferences.</p>",

Next, we will explore self-hosted solutions, which offer greater flexibility. Finally, we will examine the integration of an OCI-compatible registry with a custom authorization server. This setup allows the incorporation of complex business logic into authorization decisions, such as custom IAM and product subscriptions. While this adaptable and cost-efficient approach may involve custom development, we will provide a thorough analysis of its implications.</p>",

They want to know e.g. how many threads they can run in parallel for\ntheir threadpool size, or the number of thread-local memory arenas, etc.</p>\n<p>The kernel offers many endpoints to query this information. There is\n/proc/cpuinfo, /proc/stat, sched_getaffinity(), sysinfo(), the cpuset cgroup\nhierarchy's cpuset.cpus.effective, the isolcpus kernel command line parameter,\n/sys/devices/system/cpu/online. Further, libcs offer divergent implementations\nof sysconf(_SC_NPROCESORS_ONLIN). As a bonus, the kernel scheduler may be\nconfigured to limit resources using cpu \"shares\" or cpu quotas, so a task may\nbe able to run on all cores, but have some kind of rate limit that is not\nreflected in the physical cores the system is allowed to run on.</p>\n<p>In this talk, we propose a new library \"libamicontained\" to offer one place to\nconsolidate the logic for the answer to this question. We propose a:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>C ABI exporting</li>\n<li>statically linked</li>\n<li>zero dependency</li>\n</ul>\n<p>library which is aware of all of these different runtime configurations and\nanswers questions about cpu counts etc. in accordingly reasonable ways.</p>\n<p>Of course, the real challenge here is adoption. Ideally we can pitch such a\nlibrary as \"from the container people\", so it's an easier pitch to language\nruntimes. We are here seeking feedback on all points (heuristics to reason\nabout CPU counts, design goals, etc.) from container people as a first step.</p>\n<p>[2]: as of this writing, the jvm still uses cpuset.cpus instead of cpuset.cpus.effective on cgroupv2: https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/blob/7fbfb3b74a283261027e6c293e1a5dbc354cf0af/src/hotspot/os/linux/cgroupV2Subsystem_linux.cpp#L92-L96\n[3]: https://github.com/libuv/libuv/issues/2297 , https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/6252</p>",

We have elected to do so by creating a single LXC container for the application, that contains each rootfs image, and running each process in a chroot, using bind mounts for special directories such as <code>/proc</code>, <code>/dev</code>, <code>/sys</code>, and <code>/run</code>. This reduces the overhead of multiple containers, but could have drawbacks with respect to compatibility between processes from different distributions, and security within the application. As of the time of this talk, we will have tested an implementation of this strategy, and we will report our findings regarding its advantages and disadvantages.</p>",

On an image-based Linux system this allows atomically updating the rootfs without causing interruptions for workloads that run on discrete and separate filesystem images.

Due to the nature of these use cases, Ansible is frequently one of the best options for setting up, updating, and keeping a system up and running over time. \nFinally, this presentation covers other common needs of a container setup, such as the need to store secrets, manage services separated into logical units, and reproduce the setup on different systems.</p>",

This eases automation and reproducibility of deployments, which in turn reduces operational risk. </p>\n<p>What if we extend these properties to node provisioning, treating the OS itself like a containerised app? What if, instead of making general purpose operating systems fit our needs we radically re-think our approach, from the ground up, on how an OS should handle and work in a cloud native environment? </p>\n<p>Applying the same expectations we have towards handling of container applications we present an alternative approach to OS provisioning, configuration, and lifecycle management. Leveraging a strict separation of OS and applications, we show how a zero-touch, immutable, image-based OS can be built. And extending this concept, we make builds attestable and deployments cryptographically secure, thus helping to secure your infrastructure’s supply chain. In this talk we will cover some of the latest thinking in operating systems, going beyond the established concept of a Container Linux to a future based on the latest developments in systemd’s composable images and a generic model for image-based architectures.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Containers have undoubtedly taken the lead in the landscape of cloud-native applications, but their security limitations have prompted a revisit to conventional VMs. This renewed interest revolves around implementing additional security measures, particularly by confining containers within VM or microVM sandboxes. While this approach offers enhanced security, it introduces complexities in effectively optimizing resources on physical nodes.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, unikernels emerge as a compelling alternative —- a streamlined application kernel that preserves the benefits of VM isolation. However, the challenge lies in seamlessly integrating unikernels into the existing container ecosystem.</p>\n<p>In this talk we present <code>urunc</code>, a CRI-compatible container runtime that spawns unikernels, packaged in OCI images. We dig in the internals of <code>urunc</code>, providing insights into support for various hypervisors, network and storage handling, as well as the integration with high-level orchestration frameworks (such as k8s). At the same time, we elaborate on the network setup implications when unikernels and generic containers are mixed in the context of k8s.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Scripts and softwares are indispensable components of contemporary research. While the study of scientific instruments has been extensively covered in science and technology studies (STS), as well as aspects related to digital data, software strangely remains absent. I will build on the success of Jupyter computational notebooks to sketch a social study of open source scientific softwares. </p>\n<p>The Jupyter project, initiated in 2001 by a physics graduate student interested in scientific programming, has gradually evolved into a global data science infrastructure. I will demonstrate the importance of closely examining its trajectory by identifying the continually negotiated conditions for the transition from local usage to a role as a generic instrument, progressively leading to its integration into a diversity of services beyond scientific communities. The dissemination of computational notebooks has thus not only facilitated a convergence between open code and open science but also between the practices of researchers and those of computer developers, leading to the stabilization of a specific infrastructure for data analysis.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>As researchers continue to explore the utility of platform-based large language models (LLMs) for tasks like data extraction, annotation, and classification, concerns about access, cost, scalability, volatility, and privacy arise. Even when using local or open-source LLMs in the social sciences and humanities, it is critical to address the inherent inconsistencies of LLM outputs, and to assess their suitability for specific tasks. </p>\n<p>How should LLMs be approached and evaluated for digital research projects? I propose a methodology for systematically exploring and evaluating above issues using Prompt Compass. The tool encapsulates research affordances for working with LLMs tailored to the social sciences and humanities. It provides easy access to various local and platformed LLMs, defines default (but modifiable) parameters that produce the most consistent results, offers a library of ready-made and customizable research prompts, allows for looping over rows in a CSV, and allows for testing and evaluating various LLM-prompt combinations. </p>\n<p>As technological advances reshape social science and humanities research, tools like Prompt Compass are critical in bridging the gap between LLM technologies and methodological robustness in both qualitative and quantitative research. Such tools allow for a hands-on approach to assess the stability of prompts, their accordance with specific LLMs, and the replicability of research.</p>\n<p>Prompt Compass is available under an Apache 2.0 license at https://github.com/ErikBorra/PromptCompass</p>",

And could we do so in a participatory process that uses principles of Data Feminism and Design Justice to diversify who has a seat at the table in the tool development, and whose interest are built into the tools we make? Forged in the fire of such burning questions, we present the UB App as an open-source photovoice application for smartphones, co-created during the Urban Belonging Project (2020-22) in a process that involved scholars from Copenhagen and Amsterdam, professional urban planners, citizen engagement experts, and seven marginalized communities in Copenhagen (deaf, lgbtq+, physically disabled, mentally vulnerable, houseless, internationals, and ethnic minorities). At the 2023 FOSDEM, we are excited introduce the UB App and the UB Toolkit, and use examples from  our design process to discuss the potentials and challenges of involving a multitude of voices and perspectives in the development of digital citizen science tools. We touch upon; how inputs from different stakeholders shaped decisions about what data collection the app makes possible; how it mitigates issues of privacy and visual and spatial literacy to make the app as inclusive as possible; and how design criteria were translated into app features that open new empirical opportunities for community engagement.</p>\n<p>Resources:\nThe UB App, open-source photovoice app developed in the project (https://github.com/Urban-Belonging/UrbanBelonging), licensed as GPLv3.</p>\n<p>The UB Toolkit; open-source scripts developed in the project to transform raw data from the app into structured data files and images ready for analysis (https://urban-belonging.github.io/UrbanBelongingToolkit/), licensed as GPLv3.\nArticles about (a) the development process and (b) its use in the Urban Belonging Project: \na) Madsen, A.

    "abstract": "<p>Join us for a journey through the inception, growth, and eventual challenges faced by the Reproducibility Society at the University of Surrey, a grassroots initiative that sparked a movement in open and reproducible science collaboration. Established in June 2019, the society brought together research students from diverse disciplines to foster discussions on transparent and rigorous research methods. Drawing inspiration from the UK Reproducibility Network and various postgraduate-led initiatives nationwide, the society successfully influenced university policy, creating a supportive community for skill-sharing, motivation, and resource exchange. An initially successful project central to the society was the Monthly Mini Hacks. These were workshops that addressed the coding learning curve and promoted collaboration among students and research staff. Using Open Science Framework and open access publishing platforms, we facilitated hands-on coding experiences where information was freely available to everyone.</p>\n<p>This talk delves into the story of student collaboration, the highs and lows of open science advocacy, and the valuable lessons learned from the challenges encountered.\nThe Surrey Reproducibility Society experienced triumph, such as university-wide implementation of policies championed by the society, and failures, including the societies eventual dissolution. This talk reflects on the society’s journey, sharing tools for attendees to implement in their own initiatives, and learn from the success and struggle of our grassroots initiative. We explore the potential for future endeavours, emphasising the importance of adaptability, community engagement, and resilience in advancing the cause of open and reproducible science within the academic landscape. We intend for attendees to leave our talk wiser than we were, inspired to make positive change, and equipped with the tools to do so.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>The Carpentries teaches foundational coding and data science skills to researchers worldwide using open source training materials. A typical workshop uses several online components: a website with course notes, an etherpad for shared notes, data downloads, Github repositories and frequently a Jupyter notebook or Rstudio server. One of the popular lessons is HPC Carpentry which covers an introduction to the Unix command line and using shared High Performance Computing systems.</p>\n<p>CarpentriesOffline (https://carpentriesoffline.org) is an out of the box solution for running a Carpentries workshop from a single device such as a Raspberry Pi, old laptop or even a dedicated server. It is intended for use in environments where there is limited or no internet access. Everything needed to run the workshop including course notes, data files, software downloads, a Git server, etherpad and a Jupyter Hub server are provided by the CarpentriesOffline system. It can also provide a backup environment for those with better connectivity in the event of the Carpentries website, etherpad, GitHub etc suffering an outage. </p>\n<p>We have also developed a miniature high performance computing system based around the Raspberry Pi and RockPi single board computers to allow participants to experience using a high performance computing system without having remote access to one. </p>\n<p>This talk will describe:</p>\n<pre><code>The architecture of the CarpentriesOffline system\nThe build process that automates the creation of OS images in GitHub Actions\nWays to download and deploy it yourself\nHow to get involved with the project\n</code></pre>",

In this first release in January 2024, Infra Finder contains a standard set of information about 56 open infrastructure tools and services enabling the sharing of research data and publications that audiences can use to identify services, increase adoption, and foster development and investment in open infrastructure. </p>\n<p>At Invest in Open Infrastructure (IOI, https://investinopen.org/), we are committed to iteratively developing Infra Finder with the community. In the past months, through user interviews, focus groups, and testing, we acquired a better understanding of libraries’ and institutions’ infrastructure discovery and evaluation processes. We refined our interface design and data collection and validation workflows to be able to provide up-to-date, validated information in one place, and offer at-a-glance comparison views, with links to more granular information, thereby saving librarians time and effort in looking for scattered pieces of information to discover and evaluate what’s on offer. (More in our latest blog post: https://investinopen.org/blog/blog-introducing-infra-finder/)</p>\n<p>With this first release, we are collecting feedback and use cases for this first set of services in Infra Finder in order to further develop the information resource and the set of services covered in the tool. In this session, we will demonstrate Infra Finder. We will also share information about expressing interest in adding your tool to Infra Finder, and invitations for audience feedback and suggestions on the current iteration as we develop our next steps for expansion of the tool.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Much of the existing research about open source elects to study software repositories instead of ecosystems. An open source repository most often refers to the artifacts recorded in a version control system and occasionally includes interactions around the repository itself. An open source ecosystem refers to a collection of repositories, the community, their interactions, incentives, behavioral norms, and culture. The decentralized nature of open source makes holistic analysis of the ecosystem an arduous task, with communities and identities intersecting in organic and evolving ways. Despite these complexities, the increased scrutiny on software security and supply chains makes it of the utmost importance to take an ecosystem-based approach when performing research about open source. This talk provides guidelines and best practices for research using data collected from open source ecosystems, encouraging research teams to work with communities in respectful ways.</p>",

The simple objective was to make high quality data management easier for researchers.</p>\n<p>This presentation will explore the real needs that researchers have from data management, before moving on to how the PHAIDRA project (https://phaidra.org/community/phaidra-partners/) has been built to address these needs. We will look at the challenges and lessons (still being) learned after 15 years of running a collaborative project in the space and end with a vision of how open source, open standards and, above all, community offer the only workable solution for both Open Research and the long-term preservation of research data and digital assets.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>In the aftermath of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, Meta has taken steps to enhance transparency within its advertising network, notably through the <em>Ads Library</em> web portal and the API endpoint <em>Ads Archive</em>. Despite these initiatives, and potentially due to underutilization by the public and journalists, instances of exploitation endure on Facebook and Instagram. A recent illustration of this is the extensive RRN operation in 2023, involving hundreds of thousands of fake pages and advertisements <a href=\"https://www.sgdsn.gouv.fr/files/files/20230719_NP_VIGINUM_RAPPORT-CAMPAGNE-RRN_EN1.pdf\">1</a> <a href=\"https://www.reset.tech/documents/24102023_Networks-of-Facebook-Fake-Advertisers_Reset.pdf\">2</a>.</p>\n<p>This presentation aims to offer practical insights into navigating the API, highlighting current limitations and proposing effective workarounds. A key focus will be on Facebook’s categorization of “Social Issues, Elections or Politics.” Indeed, applying this label to an ad has two consequences : (1) heightened scrutiny by Meta moderation and (2) increased public accessibility to data such as cost and targeted audience. Deliberate mislabeling then becomes a standard modus operandi in foreign information manipulation and interference. This presentation will detail ongoing efforts to detect and quantify the prevalence of mislabeled ads using open semantic and network analysis libraries.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Embark on a journey into the intricacies of social sciences research, exploring the fusion of different platforms for a single project. Drawing from my hands-on experience in my Communication studies master's thesis, \"Visualization of a hypertextual interaction field in the form of a network using computational processes. Case study: Graffiti on freight trains in North America\", this presentation shares the challenges faced by social science students in developing robust programming projects without prior tech expertise.</p>\n<p>It underscores the pivotal role of open source tools, and community, in overcoming these challenges, shedding light on the logical links facilitated by adaptable programming projects. This allows the integration between platforms and the possibility of creating logical connections between data and theoretical-methodological aspirations.</p>\n<p>The synergy of spaCy, TensorFlow, Instagrapi, Graphology, and SigmaJS exemplifies the potential of open-source software. The presentation explores intricate adjustments made to spaCy, such as hashtag split, term indentification and graffiti entity identification (as writers and crews) without Named Entity Recognition (NER). It also share the application of custom object detection model in TensorFlow. The talk emphasizes the decision-making flexibility within Graphology/SigmaJS for network construction and visualization, with a focus on \"reduction by inference\" as a clear outcome resulting from the amalgamation of theoretical perspectives and different programming libraries or platforms.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, the interplay between TensorFlow or spaCy, model inference in Python, the role of SQL as a link between platforms, and network formation with PHP to Graphology syntax, culminating in visualization with SigmaJS in JavaScript, underscores the significance of open-source tools. \"Reduction by inference\" emerges as a crucial aspect for identifying symbolic elements in social phenomena, exemplified by graffiti on freight trains. This achievement is made possible only through open-source tools and their potential for linkage through \"data\".</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Workflow management tools have long been used in scientific computing to organise and operate workflows. Many such tools, e.g., <a href=\"https://github.com/snakemake/snakemake\">Snakemake</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/spotify/luigi\">Luigi</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/DataBiosphere/toil\">Toil</a>, have grown from the foundation of <a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/software/make/\">Make</a> (wherein users define simple rules with interdependent inputs and outputs), incorporating additional features to suit increasingly complex user needs. Initially seeing a widespread uptake in bioinformatics, workflow managers have become commonplace in many fields, for example, high-energy physics (HEP).</p>\n<p>Analyses in HEP typically consist of many non-trivially related processes with widely varying requirements. Workflow managers can vastly simplify such analyses, providing user-friendly methods to define, review and run analysis workflows. Snakemake has emerged as a leading workflow manager for HEP, with an established user base spread across major experiments. Dialogue between developers and HEP has led to integrations for distributed storage/transfer frameworks, e.g., <a href=\"https://xrootd.slac.stanford.edu\">XRootD</a>, FTP and Amazon S3, and scheduling frameworks, e.g., <a href=\"https://htcondor.org\">HTCondor</a>, <a href=\"https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html\">Slurm</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.drmaa.org\">DRMAA</a>. These integrations enable analysts to better leverage the distributed computing resources made available by experiments, significantly improving the efficiency of HEP analyses. Further collaboration between analysts and developers has seen Snakemake form the core of several standardised analysis frameworks aimed at improving analysis reproducibility such as <a href=\"https://reanahub.io\">REANA</a>.</p>\n<p>This contribution discusses the current use of workflow managers in HEP, including best practices for their application. Additionally, the anticipated requirements of analysts are considered within the context of ever-increasing data scales in HEP.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>When I approach the intersection between neuroscience and Open Research, I am often met with a guiding principle summarised by the statement \"as open as possible, as closed as necessary\". Yet, a pithy phrase rarely delivers practical suggestions to champion Open Research in the day-to-day tasks of a computational neuroscientist. This talk goes beyond one-liners, and shares open science tools to facilitate neuroimaging research at every stage of the research process and its dissemination. The talk will conclude by noting areas in need of development, and early initiatives working to address them. Neuroscience research is relevant to everyone - we all have brains, and a better understanding of how they work enables a healthier future for us all. Thus, while the content of this talk focuses on neuroscience, the principles of open research that structure the content are of interest across disciplines and industries.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>A robust, miniaturized and open-source version of an electrostatic fieldmeter sensor, the <strong>MiniMill</strong>, is presented. The sensor is designed for a fast-response detection of the atmospheric electric field strength, an intrinsic parameter of the Global Electric Circuit (GEC) that electrically links the Earth’s surface to the upper levels of the atmosphere. Such a field varies greatly with the various weather conditions due to the re-distribution of charged or uncharged aerosols and terrestrial radioactive particles. Field mill electrometers have been consecutively used for ground-based measurements of such fields under diverse conditions, but sparse iterations of the sensor exist that can be tethered to airborne measurement platforms. The lightweight, disposable and easily reproducible design of the MiniMill allows the use on agile platforms, such as weather balloons, UAVs or even campaign aircrafts, and achieves a measurement accuracy of a few V m-1 on DC fields. \nMiniMill performance has been tested in vertical profiling measurements during scientific experiments in 2019 and 2022, where sensor “constellations” were launched on-board meteorological radiosondes under both fair weather conditions and large tropospheric dust events originating from the Sahara Desert. The sensor’s response exhibits a clear influence to the vertical large scale electric field when charged dust particles are present in the atmospheric circulation, which is a significant research achievement.\nAlso, we would like to share the inherent challenges of such a sensor (or, you know, lots of sensors) implemented entirely within the academic and research community. Let's brainstorm ways to make these sensors even more awesome together!</p>",

However, until recently, Native Image was missing a key tool that Java developers use to gain insight into what an application is doing: JDK Flight Recorder. JFR has been re-implemented in Native Image so that it can be included with executables and behave with a similar experience to JFR in OpenJDK. In this presentation, we'll peel back the layers and give you a tour of some of the most vital parts of JFR's inner workings in Native Image.  At various points, we'll stop and draw comparisons to how JFR is implemented in OpenJDK.</p>\n<p>From this presentation, listeners will get exposure to some of the unique challenges to developing low-level implementations for Java-on-Java and ahead-of-time compiled applications. They will also gain a better understanding of how key JFR components work under-the-hood.</p>",

The smaller the serialized JVM/application image is, the faster it can be restored or transferred to a remote location.</p>\n<p>This talk is about minimizing the memory footprint of the JVM before a snapshot/checkpoint. Uncommitting unused parts of the address space works well for CRIU but imposes challenges for full KVM snapshots because of the \"semantic gap\" between the guest and host operating system. We will demonstrate how zeroing and kernel features like <a href=\"https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/6471384af\"><code>init_on_free</code></a>, <a href=\"https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/mm/ksm.html\">Kernel Samepage Merging</a> (KSM) and <a href=\"https://pmhahn.github.io/virtio-balloon/\">ballooning</a> can improve the snapshot/restore process and will compare <a href=\"https://criu.org/Main_Page\">CRIU</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/blob/main/docs/snapshotting/snapshot-support.md\">Firecracker</a> snapshot sizes.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>The JVM vs. WebAssembly: An In-Depth Comparative Analysis</p>\n<p>This session contrasts, in extreme detail, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and WebAssembly (Wasm), two platforms that have reshaped the landscape of software development. While their basic architecture of a \"virtual machine\" draws parallels, their design, intentions, bytecode formats, and future directions reveal considerable differences.</p>\n<p>Differences in Intent and Bytecode Adaptations</p>\n<p>We'll examine the underlying intentions behind the creation of the JVM and WebAssembly. While the JVM was initially designed to support the Java language, it has since accommodated other languages like Scala, Groovy, and Kotlin, and has been provided with implementations for dynamic languages like Ruby and Python. WebAssembly, on the other hand, was designed from the outset to support multiple languages, aiming to serve as a compact binary format for the web. We'll analyze how these intentions have influenced the way other languages have been adapted to their respective bytecode formats, by carefully examining the pain points found in JVM and Wasm implementations across the same source languages</p>\n<p>Bytecode Differences, Implementation, and Control Flow</p>\n<p>Here we will delve into the technical details of each platform's bytecode. While the JVM uses stack-based bytecode, WebAssembly uses a structured stack machine model. The implications of these different approaches will be discussed, with particular attention to aspects like performance, security, and portability. We'll also explore their respective implementations and control flow mechanisms through the use of detailed code examples, as well as high-level expositions.</p>\n<p>Standardization Processes, Stakeholders, and Incentives</p>\n<p>An important part of this talk will focus on the standardization processes of both the JVM and WebAssembly. While the JVM’s specification is controlled by Oracle, with community input through the Java Community Process (JCP), WebAssembly is an open standard developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). We'll discuss the various stakeholders involved in each process and explore the incentives that drive the evolution of these systems.</p>\n<p>The Future of WebAssembly</p>\n<p>We'll discuss the future direction of WebAssembly, touching on upcoming proposals such as garbage collection, and the Component Model. Additionally, we'll look at the development of runtimes like Wasmtime, the WebAssembly Micro-Runtime (WAMR), and GraalWasm, and discuss how these work to extend the reach of WebAssembly in new and interesting ways</p>\n<p>JVM and the Universal Compilation Target</p>\n<p>In our closing discussion, we'll tackle the common assertion that WebAssembly is \"just the JVM again\", and explore why the JVM didn’t quite become the universal compilation target it was often touted years ago. Factors such as the JVM's resource usage, security issues, specific design details have all played a part, and we'll discuss how and what WebAssembly has learned from these challenges.</p>\n<p>This session's ultimate goal is to give attendees a detailed understanding of the JVM and WebAssembly, enabling more informed decisions in software development and a clearer perspective on the futures of these two technologies.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Traceroute has been helping troubleshoot network issues since the late 80s.  In that time, it has become one of the most used tools in Internet measurement and topology discovery.  Here at Catchpoint we leverage Linux traceroute to perform measurements from nodes distributed all over the world.  In order to do what we do, we've enhanced the Linux traceroute to add some useful and interesting capabilities, and made those changes publicly available. In this presentation we are going to have an overview of the enhancements we made to traceroute.  These Improvements include support for QUIC, a new style of TCP traceroute called \"InSession\" aimed at bypassing firewalls,  ECN bleaching detection, path MTU discovery speedup and many more. The presented enhancements are made open source with the hope that they can be helpful to the networking community.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>IPv6-only networks are slowly becoming reality and are very well supported by mobile operating systems as well as macOS. Linux is slightly falling behind. In this talk, I will cover how IPv6-only and IPv6-mostly networks work and what needs to be done to have first class support in Linux.\nLet's talk about IPv6-mostly networks - the kind of networks which run IPv6-only for devices supporting it while providing some IPv4 for devices dependent on it. This can be done by DHCPv4 option called <em><a href=\"https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8925.html\">IPv6-only Preferred</a></em>. Using this option, a device can opt-out from IPv4 if it does not need it for proper functionality.</p>\n<p>But even if a device opts out from IPv4, chances are it would need some IPv4-as-a-service for supporting legacy applications. Typically, <a href=\"https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6877.html\">464XLAT</a> concept is used. This relies on a client-side translator (CLAT) responsible for converting residual IPv4 into IPv6. If such a translator is missing, which is the case for the most Linux desktop distributions nowadays, most things would work normally, but chances are you will hit some corner case where your computer complains about no connectivity.\nThere are solutions to set up CLAT on Linux but none of them is mature enough. Let's talk about what needs to be done to change this.</p>\n<p><strong>Resources:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/toreanderson/clatd\">clatd</a>: a CLAT daemon utilizing userspace translator <a href=\"http://www.litech.org/tayga/\">TAYGA</a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/ayourtch/nat46/tree/master/nat46/modules\">nat46</a> kernel-space translator</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://nicmx.github.io/Jool/en/index.html\">Jool</a>: Open Source SIIT and NAT64 for Linux </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6877.html\">RFC 6877</a>: 464XLAT: Combination of Stateful and Stateless Translation</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8925.html\">RFC 8925</a>: IPv6-Only Preferred Option for DHCPv4</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8781.html\">RFC 8781</a>: Discovering PREF64 in Router Advertisements</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

They will cover such topics as \n- what is LLDP and CDP and how they can be used as sources of info for the topology discovery\n- how Spanning Tree can be such a source too (or not at all!)\n- what is FDB and how it can be used to get information about the end nodes in your network\n- automatic device discovery</p>\n<p>Finally, the NetXMS team will guide you through the network preparation guidelines, using the NetXMS use case and their hands-on experience to show you the A to Z setup process. There are many ways where you can go wrong in this process, so the team will cover also most popular pitfalls. Please, do come if your areas of interest are network monitoring, administration and architecture, if you’d like to be more efficient in your network audit — and, generally, if you are up for a great 40 minutes spent!\nNetwork topology discovery process in focus — a detailed presentation for sysadmins, network engineers, telecom integrators, and everyone interested in networks.</p>",

GeoIP is a popular technique used to limit access to selected resources from specific locations, and IP blocklists contain lists of IP addresses that have a low reputation and for which communications (from/to) should be forbidden on healthy networks. In addition to this, IP addresses that have shown malicious behaviour (e.g. multiple service failures or WordPress attack attempts) should also be blocked.</p>\n<p>This talk introduces ipt_geofence, an open-source tool for Linux and FreeBSD that combines in one tool IP geofencing, service (e.g. SSH, Web and mail) analysis, and blocklists.

    "abstract": "<p>The challenge we were facing was to verify a firewall based on iptables according to a set of defined requirements. Included in the challenge were finding a tool to craft custom network packets, integrating the tool into the test environment and defining test cases based on the expected communication behaviors and the given firewall rules. For this it is important to know how the packet filtering in the Linux kernel is working in general. This talk will highlight how the scapy python framework works in general and how it can be used to empower developers for testing to achieve this challenge.</p>\n<p>This talk will start with an overview about the existing network packet tools and why scapy was chosen. Next it is important to understand the basics of the netfiler in the Linux kernel and how scapy is attached to it.\nOnce a functional overview of scapy is given, we are able to write proper test cases. We will explain detailed  examples how to create ICMP, UDP and TCP packets, how to manipulate the protocol header and how to choose fitting methods for sending in specific test scenarios. To wrap this up we will provide advanced real world examples based on specific iptables firewall rules.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>In June 2023, GÉANT announced the successful procurement of a new IP/MPLS layer for a next-generation network and the plan to automate the entire migration process using WorkflowOrchestrator (https://workfloworchestrator.org/) and Ansible with the aim to make the process quicker and at the same time more reliable and predictable. </p>\n<p>This means orchestrated service management with minimal interaction needed from the operator: no more CLI to configure network devices, all OSS and BSS systems synchronised and a flexible service modelling that accommodates the customizations and optimizations needed in a R&amp;E environment. The adoption of a different vendor, NOKIA in our case, poses significant challenges both in terms of low-level mechanics as well as in terms of service modelling and decomposition.    </p>\n<p>Now, we are sharing the results of this effort that has involved all the levels and parts of the organisation, profoundly changing our way of working. \nWe are sure that a view into our current progress - especially considering the multi-vendor environment that we manage - will be valuable for anyone involved in the implementation and maintenance of IP networks in the community.</p>\n<p>Particular attention will be reserved to the differences between orchestration and automation, how these two topics intersect with each other in managing complex environments and how much the mindset changes in terms of design and implementation process.</p>\n<p>GAP - GÉANT Automation Platform - which now manages the new GÉANT network, is entirely based on open-source software and more specifically on the Workflow Orchestrator (created by SURF and ESnet): high-quality software written within the R&amp;E community that works as a framework to orchestrate networks of whatever complexity and scale. GÉANT is contributing to and sustaining it to lower the barrier to adoption so that other organisations can benefit from it and join the initiative. </p>\n<p>The other cornerstone of the platform, Ansible, is an open source automation framework with a vibrant community. While not initially created for network devices, Ansible fulfils all our needs and keeps the curve of adoption low. We are eager to share how we used and misused it to achieve our needs in terms of separation between data, design and operations.</p>",

For decades, it has provided its own custom scripting language as the primary way for users to handle low-level network protocol events. With the release of Zeek 6.0, support for <a href=\"https://community.zeek.org/t/a-first-look-at-zeek-s-new-javascript-support/7188\">JavaScript as an alternative scripting language</a> has been added by embedding Node.js via the <a href=\"https://github.com/corelight/zeekjs\">ZeekJS plugin</a>.</p>\n<pre>\n$ cat hello.js\nzeek.on('zeek_init', () => {\n  console.log('Hello, Zeek!');\n});\n\n$ zeek ./hello.js\nHello, Zeek!\n</pre>\n\n<p>This talk will give a short Zeek introduction followed by a technical overview of how JavaScript support in Zeek was realized as an external plugin and demonstrate use-case examples. There will be details about Zeek's plugin architecture, its IO loop concepts and ways to interact with the Zeek script interpreter. Each of these enabled an almost seamless way to load <code>.js</code> script files, adding Node.js's libuv IO loop as another IO source into Zeek's main loop, as well as patching in JavaScript functions as Zeek event and hook handlers. Astonishingly, no modifications to Zeek's core were needed to pull this off.</p>\n<p>One area this feature opens up is Zeek interacting with external systems by using Node.js builtin functionality or off-the-shelf libraries through npm - something where the Zeek scripting language ecosystem pales in comparison or quickly requires a C++ implementation. Concrete examples are sending HTTP requests in reaction to certain events, rapid log exporter prototyping (Redis, ZeroMQ), or serving HTTP APIs directly from within Zeek.</p>",

    "abstract": "<h2>k8gb</h2>\n<p>k8gb is a Kubernetes native load balancing solution that enables arbitrary workloads to run in a disaster recovery mode as well as in the round robin fashion. It assumes geographically dispersed availability zones aka failure domains.</p>\n<p>Luckily, there is another open-source standard that can help with setting up such Kuberneres clusters. Cluster API is a standard that unifies Kubernetes cluster lifecycle and day-2 operations across multiple cloud providers.</p>\n<p>In this talk we will be talking about an open-source way to fully automated K8s clusters that can host workloads that can survive any failure, using pure DNS as the underlying tool for switching the communication among available Kubernetes clusters. No single vendor lock-in. Workloads can be deployed in AWS, Azure, GCP, on-prem. The only common denominators are Kubernetes and Cluster-API.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>k8gb is DNS based global service load balancer that can interconnect multiple Kubernetes clusters into one resilient system. Join this talk to learn how it can handle a failover scenario when pods in one cluster go down and second cluster in different location saves the day.</p>\n<p>k8gb is an open-source Kubernetes operator that is deployed in each participating cluster. It is comprised of CoreDNS, ExternalDNS and the k8gb controller itself. Using ExternalDNS it can create a zone delegation on a common cloud DNS server like Route53 or Infoblox so that the embedded CoreDNS servers work as an authoritative DNS. K8gb controller makes sure these CoreDNS servers are updated accordingly based on the readiness probes of the application.</p>\n<p>In this sense this solution is unique, because it is using Kubernetes native tools with customisable probes and battle tested DNS protocol instead of HTTP pings or other similar approaches where single point of failure might be a problem. In k8gb architecture all k8s clusters are equal and there is no SPoF except the common edge DNS server.</p>\n<h2>Cluster API</h2>\n<p>Cluster API is an umbrella standard for multiple cloud providers that can easily create new clusters using Kubernetes patterns such as controllers and custom resources. Together with k8gb it provides very nice synergy to the k8s ecosystem and also enables deploying stuff into those newly created clusters because of its hierarchical nature (parent as a management cluster &amp; child as the workload cluster). </p>\n<p>So at the end of day we have two paradigms - k8gb representing the p2p decentralized solution while Cluster API representing the centralized architecture with single management cluster (SPoF). Believe it or not but these two above-mentioned paradigms complete each other and work together in synergy.</p>\n<p>Come to this talk and you will learn more about this setup.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Kubernetes has historically taken a very hands-off approach to the multi-network topic. If you’re a telecom and network jockey you know the problem: Without it, pods only have one interface. When it came to solving this in Kubernetes, rather than tackling the problem, it was left for the ecosystem to solve. Thus, projects like Multus CNI, CNI Genie and DANM came to be: they solved a community problem (“I want more than one interface in my pod!”) outside Kubernetes, following its API extension philosophy.</p>\n<p>Fast forward a bunch of years: there’s a new KEP to provide an in-tree solution to multi-networking, which will allow people to express in a Kubernetes native way that their pods require more than one network. </p>\n<p>We’re going to look at the problem from two perspectives, first a political one: What’s the community experience with working with the Kubernetes community and what kind of challenges have we faced over the years? We’ll share our stories of successes and, yes, of the failures. But because there’s only so much politics you can stomach, we’ll also look at it from the other end of the spectrum – the hands-on-a-terminal-perspective, looking directly at an implementation.</p>\n<p>Together we’ll explore architecture and API changes for Pod interfaces as Kubernetes elements, along with a prototype implementation … in Multus CNI of all things. We invite you to participate in unifying advanced networking technology in Kubernetes.</p>",

That’s how you create a cluster, that’s how you deploy your workload.</p>\n<p>But is it, for real, as simple as it sounds? How do you bring declarativeness to the imperative world? In the current state of things, host networking is one huge imperative nightmare. So how to happily marry an old-school Network Manager and brand new Kubernetes API? In this session we will demonstrate how NMState provides you with a Declarative Network API, finally allowing you to manage host networking in a declarative manner.</p>\n<p>To make it more entertaining, we will show you how the Kubernetes cluster with NMState Operator manages networking on the nodes it deploys. It may sound like a chicken and egg situation, but trust us, it is not. Last but not least, we show how it protects itself from applying destructive network changes potentially taking your cluster down.</p>\n<p>Join us and create the most complex network topologies on the fly.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p><a href=\"https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes\">Kubernetes</a> networking is often perceived as a labyrinth, where pods, services, and ingresses exchange data packets. While Container Network Interfaces (CNIs) undoubtedly play a pivotal role, the networking landscape extends far beyond these plugins.</p>\n<p>We'll embark on a journey beyond the confines of CNI, exploring the realm of the kube-apiserver, the central control plane that orchestrates the entire Kubernetes ecosystem. We'll uncover the secrets of the kubelet, the node agent that receives instructions from the kube-apiserver and is responsible for managing the lifecycle of pods and containers on that node.</p>\n<p>This talk goes beyond the basics, exploring the hidden gems and dirty secrets of Kubernetes networking.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Software is eating the world, and networking is no exception.  Gone are the days when there was a distinct boundary between the application servers and the networking connecting them together. In the cloud native era that we live in, much of traditional networking between applications ends up being defined entirely within the Linux kernel networking stack, sometimes enhanced by eBPF programs, to provide highly scalable and efficient connectivity between Linux containers.  When network packets go missing, its no longer sufficient to capture packets with tcpdump, or trace the path through the Linux firewall rules. You may have to look deeper into the Linux kernel's networking subsystem and trace the packet flow through each of the kernel networking functions watching for packet filtering or modifications. </p>\n<p>Cilium's Packet Where aRe You (PWRU) was purpose built to help discover problems deep in the Linux kernel's network subsystem. It is a great diagnostic tool to reach for when you've ruled out DNS or an obvious firewall rule blunder.  In this talk I'll review how PWRU works, and walk through a few usage examples.</p>",

We will compare VNC (Virtual Network Computing) to RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol). Using the Yocto Project and OpenEmbedded, we are going to build core-image-weston for Raspberry Pi 5 and configure VNC with TLS security and user authentication. Step-by-step tutorial will be provided to demonstrate the configuration of a remote connection to Raspberry Pi 5 from another computer through Vinagre, an open-source VNC client designed for the GNOME Desktop.</p>\n<p>The presentation is appropriate for anyone interested in remote access to embedded Linux devices.

    "abstract": "<p>Support for hardware video codecs has been around in V4L2 since the memory-to-memory (M2M) framework was merged in 2010. While it initially allowed support for firmware-driven stateful implementations, it did not cover the case of stateless hardware codecs where the kernel has to configure hardware blocks directly instead of relying on a (proprietary) firmware.</p>\n<p>Stateless video decoding became supported in 2018 after Bootlin's successful crowdfunding campaign targeting Allwinner platforms. The only remaining piece missing after this work was support for stateless video encoders.</p>\n<p>This talk will present the current effort to bring support for stateless video encoders in mainline V4L2. This includes an overview of the current preliminary work on selected hardware platforms and video codecs as well as a brief summary of today's out-of-tree support. It will be followed by an introduction to the difficult process of creating a new userspace API to support them in mainline Linux, the inherent trade-offs that need arbitration and why this is taking time to converge.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>The barcode scanner market is a walled garden hostile to flexibility. Vendors enforce their proprietary SDKs or applications, documentation is often limited or missing, sometimes it is even required to sign a contract before getting software access to purchased devices. This locks the user inside a single ecosystem, as switching to a different option would mean rewriting software specific to the device.</p>\n<p>enioka Scan is an open-source Android library enabling users to choose the device vendors that really fit their criteria at any given time. It exposes a single API compatible with all supported scanning devices, working on top of a vendor-specific SDKs made open-source whenever possible. The library handles per-device specifics, so the user can focus on the functional aspects of their application. It is also designed to be easily extended with more support for devices not yet compatible.</p>\n<p>In this presentation, we will go over the causes of vendor lock-in in the context of barcode scanning devices. After a quick history of the project, we will have an overview of how the library works and how it manages to handle devices from different vendors. Finally, we will explain how you can contribute to this project, and why your help matters.</p>",

The Zephyr Project is rapidly emerging as a leading real-time operating system (RTOS).  Zephyr integrates open-source and security best practices to ensure a vendor-neutral, secure, and reliable platform.</p>\n<p>In this talk, Mohammed Billoo will describe the process of getting to Zephyr to run on the UPduino (https://tinyvision.ai/pages/the-upduino), flashed with the neorv32 RISC-V processor (https://github.com/stnolting/neorv32). He will walk through building and flashing the neorv32 RISC-V core on the FPGA, creating a Zephyr application that can output Hello World to the UART, and loading the application to the FPGA. Mohammed will also walk through the necessary Zephyr drivers to get the application running.\nThis talk will demonstrate how combining RISC-V and Zephyr on an FPGA opens up new opportunities for embedded software applications. Using open-source software and firmware on a low-cost FPGA reduces the bar for entry for enthusiasts and hobbyists. The audience will learn the following in this talk:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Relevance of the RISC-V instruction set architecture for hobbyists</li>\n<li>Overview and structure of the neorv32 RISC-V processor</li>\n<li>Overview and structure of The Zephyr Project RTOS</li>\n<li>RISC-V support in Zephyr</li>\n<li>Relevant Zephyr drivers</li>\n<li>Demo: From Empty Silicon To Zephyr Boot</li>\n</ul>",

    "abstract": "<p>It was a long weekend in May 2020. Like many of my human siblings stuck at home with time on their hands due to an ongoing pandemic, I was busy trying to perfect my bread recipe. Fast forward to a few hours later, I had assembled an <strong>Arduino-based “artificial nose” that used a gas sensor and AI (so-called TinyML) to learn and detect scents</strong> (hence potentially the smell of a perfectly fermented sourdough starter). As I open-sourced and started to share the project on social media, it went viral… and I felt like an impostor, as most of the code powering it was, frankly, hackish. Or maybe it wasn’t, as it had the merit of having helped me invent something new, in literally a few hours.</p>\n<p>In this talk I will <strong>walk you through some of the key features of the artificial nose, and how I eventually rewrote my original code to leverage Zephyr</strong> (an open-source real-time operating system) in order to make it easier for myself and the community to extend the project, and run it on a variety of hardware targets.</p>\n<p>You will learn, among other things:\n* How to move from a complex “super loop” to well architected threads and event-based programming ;\n* How to run TinyML models (ex. TensorFlow Lite) while not compromising the rest of your embedded system ;\n* How to build an efficient and easy-to-maintain graphical user interface ;\n* How to leverage Zephyr hardware-abstraction layer.</p>\n<p>All the code and demonstrations shown in the talk is open source and available on GitHub, and you are very much encouraged to go ahead and build your own artificial nose after the presentation!</p>",

Currently in buildroot, for example, about half of the packages are\nnot supported on MMU-less systems. Furthermore, considering that busybox also does\nnot support the 'ip link' command for the CAN interface, it was evident that the\nnumber of difficulties to overcome had increased so that, in addition to the driver\ndevelopment, the user space also needed to be patched.\nMy target expanded: I definitively wanted to overcome the limitations of the user\nspace and make it available to the open-source community.</p>\n<p>How has the development of the bxCAN driver evolved? Was it later merged into the\nLinux kernel? Which packages needed to be patched to test it? What patches were\napplied?

    "abstract": "<p><a href=\"https://flutter.dev/\">Flutter</a> is an open-source UI Software Development kit created by Google using the BSD-3-Clause license. It is used for developing multi-platform applications with a single codebase. While traditionally, Flutter has been used for Android and iOS development, it has been steadily gaining market share in the embedded Linux world. While the meta-flutter layer for Yocto has been usable since version 1.17.0 on March 31st, 2020, the Buildroot embedded Linux SDK has only recently added support, starting with <a href=\"https://gitlab.com/buildroot.org/buildroot/-/blob/2023.11.x/package/flutter-engine/flutter-engine.mk?ref_type=heads#L24\">Flutter version 3.13.9 on Buildroot version 2023.11</a>. </p>\n<p>This talk will cover three main points.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The first is a brief history of the numerous difficulties that had to be overcome when adding the Flutter packages and infrastructure to Buildroot. This topic covers several idiosyncrasies of obtaining the source code and cross-compiling Flutter, such as how the source code is downloaded, how it is not currently possible to create an automated reproducible tarball when downloading the source code, and generating a tarball because of a reliance on .git files, how every third-party dependency is bundled into the source tarball, and even a patched clang is included in the source tarball that must be used when compiling.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The second point covers the advantages and disadvantages of Flutter compared to Qt QML and LVGL.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The final point covers how to start and integrate an existing Flutter project into an existing Buildroot infrastructure using the flutter-gallery package as a reference.  This includes using an external tree for development purposes, how to profile an application for performance, and problems/concerns to be aware of.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you use or are interested in using <a href=\"https://buildroot.org/\">Buildroot</a> for your embedded Linux project and are interested in using Flutter for your next project, then this talk is for you!</p>",

This feature gives projects written in Go better visibility about test coverage, resulting in enhanced stability and more.\nARMO's experiment consisted of providing the complete test coverage percentage as a metric for generated Seccomp profiles. During the automated tests we hooked the system calls, collecting them into a security profile, by using eBPF. This allowed us to measure the generated profile reliability that was created with the system calls used during this time.\nUnfortunately, not all the experiments succeed.\nThis talk will give an introduction to the research we did and end what are the limitations that we encountered during our journey.</p>",

It is especially difficult when you're working with a small microcontroller and the existing graphics libraries have various limitations. So I set to work to fix that by building my own graphics library for small embedded systems.</p>\n<p>A year ago I started working on a firmware for the Pine64 PineTime, using TinyGo of course. My goal was to have a usable firmware for the watch, while improving the surrounding TinyGo ecosysteem wherever I could. My end goal is to make developing firmware as simple as writing any desktop application.</p>\n<p>In this talk I'll describe how I initially added support for the PineTime in TinyGo with some low level hardware details, how low cost displays work, and how I improved the performance of these displays under TinyGo. But I'll also describe how I built a somewhat accurate simulator as part of the hardware abstraction layer, how I implemented a very fast graphics library using generics, and of course how I used all of these to write firmware that can run on the PineTime and any similar smartwatch supported by TinyGo.</p>\n<p>While this talk may get technical sometimes, I'll make sure it's still easy to follow even if you're not an embedded developer.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>In the recent years I have worked a lot on building community Internet services using distributed systems, in the context of Deuxfleurs, a French self-hosting collective. We use distributed systems with nodes in different physical locations to help us tolerate temporary failures such as Internet links going down, as well as hardware failures of our low-cost, second-hand servers.</p>\n<p>We built our platform as a set of microservices, taking the form of Docker containers orchestrated by Nomad (a smaller Kubernetes). This allows us to divide our workload in pieces that can be ran on one or many machines simultaneously, and that can in most cases be automatically moved from one geographical region to another in case of failure. This approach works relatively well, however I am frustrated to no end by the idiosyncraties of containers and the Linux/UNIX ecosystem in general which contains huge piles of legacy and is massively getting in our way for building a clean, declarative and resilient dynamic microservice architecture.</p>\n<p>I have a dream that one day we can build an orchestrator for microservices that is built on a microkernel, component-based operating system. We just need a way to simply multiplex fundamental resources such as storage and networking (NOT a filesystem, and NOT a full TCP/IP stack with iptables or whatnot), and to schedule and run unikernels or tiny Linux VMs in a cluster of machines. How hard can that be?</p>\n<p>I will do a brief talk at the beginning but I'm hoping for this session to be mostly just talking of what can be done in this direction.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>One of the key aspects of Unikernels is modularity: each component can be considered a standalone library that users selectively incorporate into their Unikernel. This design flexibility empowers users to create minimal and specialized images tailored for individual applications. Despite the advantageous compartmentalization, the process of building a Unikernel remains monolithic. Users must download the Unikernel framework, along with any external dependencies, and engage in a build-from-scratch procedure, even with minimal code changes.</p>\n<p>We propose Bunny, a novel build system that aims to simplify the process of building Unikernels. Bunny creates an alternative build process, making full use of the modular aspect of Unikernels. We structure <code>Bunny</code> using a layered approach, where each component represents a distinct layer. Users do not need to build each component from scratch; instead, each respective layer is fetched and can be used to produce the resulting Unikernel image. Moreover, <code>Bunny</code> keeps track of all the dependencies for each component, relieving users from the pain of manually identifying and building all the dependencies.</p>",

Still, a common issue is one of usability and reaching parity with Linux-based and Docker-based deployment.</p>\n<p>We're excited to announce that we are now there. We are now at the point where we can use unikernels as a drop in replacement for containers, improving performance, resource consumption, cost and security.</p>\n<p>In this talk we take a tour on <a href=\"https://unikraft.org/\">Unikraft</a>, an open source unikernel development kit, and its companion tool, <a href=\"https://unikraft.org/docs/cli\">KraftKit</a>. We demonstrate how to easily build, package, run and deploy common applications with Unikraft, benefiting from its focus on specialization. With its POSIX compliant interface, Unikraft allows seamless integration of existing Linux applications. KraftKit provides the tooling layer to allow every action to be one command line away: building your preferred application, running it natively or on a remote setup, starting a debug session and many more.</p>\n<p>The talk will be practical, filled with demonstrations with different applications running on top of Unikraft and pointing out resources and information for integrating Unikraft and KraftKit into your workflow, be it research, hobbyist / professional or commercial.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>MPI applications are parallel applications that require CPU, memory and high-throughput channels to communicate. These applications are usually deployed on top of a general purpose operating system that provides services like memory allocation, process creation, inter-process communication and networking. The resources like memory or CPU are shared with other processes in the system and with the OS itself. The MPI application competes for host's resources thus limiting its scalability. In this talk, we present the recent effort to build an implementation of the MPI standard on top of the Toro unikernel. In this deployment, we provide a minimalist implementation of the MPI standard as a library that compiles with the application and the kernel thus resulting in a single binary that can be deployed as microVM. Such a library leverages the parallelism that Toro proposes to effectively deploy a MPI application.  Some of the benefits of  using Toro are one instance per core, cooperative scheduler without preemption and local resources. To benchmark our implementation, we port some the OSU Micro-Benchmarks and run them in the Intel Xeon Gold platform. We report the benefits of our architecture when comparing it with existing MPI implementation on Linux.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Application-specific unikernels have the reputation for being complicated to create. Instead, being binary compatible with Linux promises that you can use a unikernel as a simple drop-in replacement, especially for running container workloads. But how can we avoid redeveloping Linux for compatibility reasons? What about <code>fork</code>, <code>clone</code> and co. while maintaining a single address space? Where can we still specialize and keep performance benefits?</p>\n<p>In this talk we will dive into our efforts over the last year with <a href=\"https://unikraft.org\">Unikraft</a> for binary compatibility with Linux. We'll discuss the challenges we have solved, the lessons we have learned, and the optimizations we have been able to make. In all of this, we have set the goal of not requiring to recompile any application code.</p>",

Not only that, the same improvements make it possible to execute dynamically linked executables via Linux dynamic linker. I will also briefly describe a newly added strace-like capability aimed to help analyze system calls on the fly.</p>\n<p>In addition, I will explain how we have implemented the ENA networking driver and thus made it possible to run OSv on AWS Nitro EC2 instances. </p>\n<p>Finally, I will briefly cover the upcoming build configuration tool, based on Xconfig, aimed to let the user select OSv kernel components to be included or excluded and various parameters to be configured.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>The <em>Genode OS Framework</em> is certainly not a newcomer and has seen continuous improvements in its quarterly releases for more than 15 years. <em>Sculpt</em>, the Genode-based desktop OS, has been around for more than five years and has proven itself to be fit for day-to-day use. Moreover, Sculpt OS has more recently been adapted to the <em>PinePhone</em>. With this solid foundation, application development for Genode comes brightly into the picture. For this purpose, the <em>Goa</em> tool has been initiated by <em>Norman Feske</em> in 2019 as a side project. By moving Goa under the umbrella of Genode's core developer team, the tool has seen various improvements over the past year.</p>\n<p>In this talk, I will present the concepts behind Goa and walk you through the streamlined application development process: from importing 3rd-party source code, over test-running on the host system, to packaging and publishing the result for Sculpt OS.</p>",

In the run up to March 2024 we’ve been doing a lot of work to ensure today’s Matrix can help with the immediate interoperability challenges - and also contributing heavily to the IETF More Instant Messaging Interoperability (MIMI) working group to provide IETF-track longer-term interoperability specifically for DMA.</p>\n<p>By requiring open APIs (or open standards) for communication, the European Commission is effectively creating an entirely new industry on top of today’s communication platforms - which if executed correctly could supplant the public telephone network with a genuinely open communication fabric for everyone: effectively extending Matrix and/or its derivatives to a multi-billion user network.</p>\n<p>In this talk, we’ll explain the work we’ve done with with end-to-end-encryption-preserving Matrix bridges, our contributions to MIMI - and the possibility that Matrix 3.0 (yes, 3.0) might end up evolving into compatibility with MIMI, while adding in the full richness and decentralisation of today’s Matrix.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, since introducing the idea of Matrix 2.0 at FOSDEM 2023 (https://archive.fosdem.org/2023/schedule/event/matrix20/), the Matrix core team has been slogging away along the road to actually shipping it: providing secure, open, decentralised communication which can compete with the mainstream proprietary centralised alternatives.  As ever, the path has had some unexpected twists and turns along the way - and we’d like to share our progress.</p>\n<p>We’ll also cover the latest updates on converging on matrix-rust-sdk as the flagship 3rd generation Matrix client SDK (as showcased by Element X and Fractal 5); rolling out instant login, sync &amp; launch via Sliding Sync; transitioning to OpenID Connect for all authentication; implementing full E2EE scalable VoIP and video via MatrixRTC and LiveKit; and major new Matrix reliability projects including trafficlight (full-end-to-end testing of Matrix clients covering both chat and VoIP) and complement-crypto (a full E2EE torture-test suite exercising matrix-rust-sdk and matrix-js-sdk).</p>\n<p>Finally, we’ve also been maturing our governance processes: ensuring the Matrix.org Foundation is operationally independent of other companies (e.g. Element) with Josh Simmons joining as the Foundation’s first employee and Managing Director - we’ll cover the work Josh is doing in formalising a Governing Board and getting the Foundation to stand on its own two feet.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>In the last fifteen years, there has been a significant shift from on-premise data centers to the cloud.\nThis process was due to the perceived cost difference between the legacy on-premise data centers and the newer and shinier public cloud.\nDue to a renewed interest in privacy and data sovereignty, many organizations are returning to the on-premise with private clouds.\nFor the success of such initiatives, it is fundamental to learn from the past and understand how a successful private cloud should be structured.\nI started working in 2004 when almost everything was on-premise, and I had a front-row seat to the migrations that occurred in this period thanks to my roles as a Systems and Solutions Architect.\nIn this talk, we will recap the last twenty years of migrations to learn some key lessons, and then we will analyze what a successful private cloud would look like, which technologies might help, and which could be risky bets.</p>",

Attestation plays a central role in asserting that confidential systems are indeed confidential. This technology can be used in a number of ways, notably to implement Confidential Virtual Machines, Confidential Containers and Confidential Clusters. This talk explores the various chains of trust required to preserve confidentiality in each of these use cases. In each scenario, we will describe the root of trust, what is being proven, who verifies the proof, and what a successful verification allows.</p>\n<p>We will discuss techniques and technologies such as local and remote attestation, firmware-based certification, the use and possible implementations of a virtual TPM, attested TLS. We will also discuss the different requirements to attest an execution environment, a workload, a user, or a node joining a cluster.</p>",

However, while its environmental cost is quite known nowadays, the societal and geopolitical issues triggered are more hidden and taboo. From the extraction of minerals to recycling without forgetting the planned obsolescence, the digital industry is a revolution that is far from keeping all its promises of a radiant future.</p>\n<p>One of the main means for reducing the environmental footprint of digital technology is to extend the lifespan of our devices. Fairphone is a European manufacturer that designs and produces smartphones with the goal of having a lower environmental footprint and better social impact than the norms in the electronics industry. We will speak about how, at Fairphone, we fight planned obsolescence, we will see how the eco-design of hardware modularity is one key for longevity but we will also see the role of open source to make our devices last longer from a software perspective.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>This talk is about our Journey as an Open Source creator, project maintainer and company, from being alone creating the Open Source software XWiki and the associated company, to the first users and contributors, first hires, first clients, growing the company over the years to more than 50 people, fully bootstrapped. It is about the struggles to compete with proprietary software and then having customers asking to transition from their provider forcing them to a 5x more expensive offer. It is about creating a new product CryptPad and running 2 open source communities and our journey providing a privacy protecting software. It is about licenses and the temptation to close some code to be able to be more successful and finally finding other ways. It is about the joys of building Open Source together as a team, how you meet other FOSS people, at FOSDEM, in local communities or in business conferences, and collaborate and share your passion and beliefs. It is about Digital Sovereignty. It's also about what we could have done differently if we knew. It is about how you can live from Open Source, while respecting your contributors, your users , your customers and your employees.\nI hope this talk, sharing our experience will help other FOSS lovers be able also to live from Open Source and push them to move to full time Open Source. As for many companies, our story is somewhat a roller coaster with its set of successes and failures. Open Source success takes time, but good things can come for those who are resilient enough.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>The Internet is witnessing the appearance of fundamental innovation at the network layer thanks to the real-world deployment of the SCION [1] next-generation Internet. SCION is a clean-slate, secure and robust Internet architecture, designed to provide route control, failure isolation, and explicit trust information for end-to-end communication. The SCION real-world deployment is rapidly expanding, pushed by several entities that have adopted SCION for their critical use cases. </p>\n<p>This talk will be divided into two main parts. Firstly, we will present the latest status of SCION production deployments. One example is the SCION Education, Research and Academic Network (SCIERA) [2]. The SCIERA Network connects via native SCION (i.e., “BGP free”) 12 R&amp;D institutions on 3 different continents (including the National University of Singapore, Princeton University, University of Virginia, among several others). The planned expansion will include several additional institutions, bringing native SCION connectivity to over 500,000 users by mid-2024. </p>\n<p>Secondly, we will provide an up-to-date overview of the SCION AWESOME projects [3]. This curated list encompasses projects from various realms, e.g., Path-aware-networking API (in Golang and Java), Python and C/C++ bindings, applications using SCION, SCION network tools, SCION SEED emulator, among many others.  </p>\n<p>[1] SCION official site: https://scion-architecture.net/ </p>\n<p>[2] SCIERA official documentation site: https://sciera.readthedocs.io/en/latest/. </p>\n<p>[3] AWESOME SCION: https://github.com/scionproto/awesome-scion</p>",

Our goal with Sequoia PGP was not just to\nimplement OpenPGP in Rust, but to provide a set of privacy and\nsecurity tools that are easier to use, and more robust than what was\npreviously available.</p>\n<p>Although OpenPGP is widely considered hard to use, overcomplicated,\nand the stuff of nerds, our prior experience working on another\nOpenPGP implementation suggested that the OpenPGP standard is actually\npretty good, but the tooling needs improvement.</p>\n<p>In this talk, I'll present Sequoia's architecture (library first), our\ndesign philosophy (usable, low-level, unopinionated interfaces, which\nare secure by default and are complemented by high-level opinionated\ninterfaces), and the status of the project (we released 1.0 of our\nlow-level library in December 2020, and are currently working towards\n1.0 releases of our higher-level libraries and services).</p>\n<p>Today, Sequoia PGP is used by the RPM package manager, which has\nshipped with Fedora since version 38.  Sequoia PGP has been adopted by\nSecureDrop, a whistle blowing platform, which is relied by many news\norganizations around the world.  And, Switzerland's BioMedIt uses it\nas part of their Sett tool, which hospitals and researchers use to\nexchange sensitive medical information.</p>",

    "abstract": "<h5>Explore the Transformative Power of Community-Driven Trust and Secure Data Monetization</h5>\n<p>In an era when data flows seamlessly across diverse decentralized systems and organizations, establishing trust and confidence in the data becomes paramount. Data from IoT devices, distributed applications, and edge servers cross multiple boundaries: trust zones, firewalls, networks, stakeholders, organizations, and geographies. No single entity in such an ecosystem can own the trust.</p>\n<p>Project Alvarium is a Linux Foundation (LF) Edge project which aims to build an open-source framework and SDK for creating trust fabrics which deliver data from devices to applications with measurable confidence. Unlike a one-size-fits-all solution, the Alvarium framework empowers communities to construct their unique fabric with preferred technologies, cultivating a rich ecosystem of interoperable trust fabrics.</p>\n<p>This presentation explores the transformative potential of a community-owned data confidence fabric (DCF) and trustworthy monetization of data using an open-source distributed ledger, Hedera network, and smart contracts. By embracing open-source principles, our solution not only ensures accessibility, but also encourages a diverse community of contributors to actively participate in refining and expanding the framework. This collaborative approach enhances the solution's robustness and aligns with our commitment to transparency, making the technology more trustworthy and widely adoptable in the broader open-source community. Topics include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Insights from the Alvarium project</li>\n<li>Demonstration of a DCF, both its construction and operation</li>\n<li>How a decentralized approach to data confidence can empower individuals and organizations, promoting data sovereignty and mitigating risks associated with centralized control</li>\n<li>Advantages and contributions the proposed framework offers to the open-source community, ranging from enhanced security and privacy to collaborative innovation</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Part of the work being presented and demonstrated is based on a joint effort of multiple academic and industrial partners from the European Commission-funded CLEVER consortium. CLEVER is a research project which among other objectives aims to aid the adoption of open access and systematic use of open and standard interfaces. By engaging with the principles of open-source development, this presentation hopes to inspire FOSDEM’24 attendees to envision and actively participate in the creation of a community-owned DCF framework, fortifying the foundation of a more trustworthy and collaborative digital landscape.</p>",

Let me show you what it looks like, why this is important, and what you might be able to do with it even if you never use any other part of MF2.\nOh, and we're already building open-source tools for working with the data model in JavaScript and Python. Formatting runtimes are available in JavaScript as a polyfill for the proposed <a href=\"https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-messageformat\">Intl.MessageFormat</a> API, and in C++ and Java as a part of this spring's ICU 75 release.</p>",

Later he joined Apache Openmeetings project and translated the software into Chinese, including edit check, manual, website, and language framework. As a senior translator in some of China's largest open source communities, recently he is involved in a review role in translating the latest Linux Foundation Research report \"Standing Together on Shared Challenges\" on the 2023 Open Source Congress into Chinese, and also working on video subtitle and review of Deep Dive AI sessions by OSI into Chinese. In the talk, the speaker will share his translation experience and lessons he learned, how to recruit new people to translate his project, how to motivate volunteer contributors via rewarding methods, how to translate Openmeetings website, tools such as DeepL, Google Translator, Crowdin and Youtube will be discussed.\nThough this is not a technical session about how to do translation, but we assume the audience should have basic translation and open source knowledge.</p>",

Used to develop applications from web browsers to OS like Fuchsia, Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, and Windows. It's also in the top ten most popular projects on GitHub.</p>\n<p>Flutter was first released by Google in 2015 supporting Android devices to render consistently at 120 frames per second and soon later supporting iOS. In 2021 Google released Flutter 2 supporting Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems.</p>\n<p>Flutter emerged in the embedded world as an alternative to other UI frameworks like LVGL or Qt. The main advantages are free and open source against commercial license; declarative UI approach against procedural UI approach meaning a more expressive and flexible approach; hot reload and hot restart against rebuild and redeploy making work less time-consuming; large and active open source community.</p>\n<p>This talk will give an overview of these topics, starting from the integration in the OS build system like Buildroot and Yocto, showing the development environment and the differences between the languages C++/QML and Dart/Flutter with code examples.</p>\n<p>Finally, I'll quickly show a real industrial custom product developed and shipped with a Flutter UI application, the challenges and the result that we achieved.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Web authentication is more complex then ever. While out-of-the-box 2FA features are helpful, sometimes developers need to customize authentication flows to meet specific business requirements, like registration, credential recovery, or adaptive security to step-up authentication based on risk scores.  All IDPs have some kind of black magic to implement customizations--normally some script or code interface. But at the <a href=\"https://jans.io\">Janssen Project</a>, we saw how hard it is to write, maintain and transfer this custom authentication code, and we wanted something more re-usable. So in early 2021, we introduced <a href=\"https://docs.jans.io/head/agama/introduction/\">Agama</a>, a low-code programming language to simplify the development of web identity journeys. Agama defines a standard way to build web identity journeys in a potentially vendor-neutral way. It’s both a programming language and a project archive format. In 2023, Gluu launched <a href=\"https://agama-lab.gluu.org\">Agama Lab</a>, a free developer tool. Agama Lab takes low code to a new level by enabling developers and architects to graphically white board identity journeys and to release deployable Agama archives directly to a GitHub repository. The Agama Lab Explore Catalog enables developers to fork working projects and adapt them more specific business requirements. Low code may seem silly--yes you can also just write the code. But low code can reduce the time to knowledge-transfer customizations to the next team. And graphical tools faciliate communciation with the non-identity team to help explain the various flows and how they relate.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Identity Governance and Administration (IGA), as a natural extension of Identity Management, is a core component of any IT infrastructure. It automates user processes (joiner, mover, leaver) and their accounts in the whole infrastructure. Access Management (AM) is an inherent partner of IGA. It provides authentication and, to some extent, authorization for end users. To reach the full potential of both IGA and AM, it is necessary to interconnect them. </p>\n<p>This talk will focus on open-source IGA midPoint and show how it can deliver extra features when well-integrated with an AM system. We will cover basics like providing information about users and their access to the AM. Then, we will focus on how information from AM can flow to IGA and enable features like just-in-time provisioning even to systems that do not support it natively. Moreover, the data from AM, like login timestamps, can enhance IGA reporting capabilities and even enable the preparation of complex access policies. That can further automate your processes for managing accounts and use to tighten security and even save money for usage and licencing costs.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, we will examine the partially implemented feature of midPoint for managing multilateral identities and use them to create a unified user profile. It envisioned this feature would interlace traditional on-premise identities (HR, student registry, customer databases, etc.) with identity federations, social, national and other IDs.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>With a move to cloud-based hosting of the application servers, a typical application is not a member of the same corporate IT environment anymore. Application servers often use OAuth 2.0 protocol flows to identify their users. Identity Providers (IdPs) provide OAuth 2.0 endpoints to applications and pull\nover the tasks of authenticating and authorizing users’ access to application resources. They become a central point of interaction between enterprise domains, if those still in use in the organization, and applications. This approach allows to integrate both in-house applications and cloud-based SaaS\napplications provided by third parties.</p>\n<p>The separation of enterprise IT architecture and an enterprise domain structure, however, leads to a larger issue. While in the past management of the application servers was part of the enterprise domain services (Active Directory, RHEL IdM, …) where regular users and application developers were\npresent at the same time. Maintaining common access to these servers was easy: since the application server is enrolled into the domain, it can consume domain identities. Not anymore: there is no such guarantee to have both application servers and application developers belonging to the same domain. Effectively, there is a need to access information that is only available in a federated way: through some broker, like IdP. On top of that, the broker might not be able to pass through a certain type of information that might simply not exist on the other side. For example, for Linux servers working together as a compute capacity, it is crucial to have a uniform view on POSIX information about users and groups. But an IdP might simply lack this information because there might be no need for it at the place where a user account is defined.</p>\n<p>This talk aims to define a common set of requirements and approaches to represent a secure POSIX identity management integration with OAuth 2.0-based identity providers. Aside from requirements towards client software on the Linux platform, we aim to define possible requirements towards other components of the integration, based on our experience developing Samba, SSSD, and FreeIPA for more than 25 years.</p>",

    "abstract": "<h2>Bypass assembler when generating LTO object file</h2>\n<p>This summer, I worked with my mentor Jan Hubicka and Martin Jambor on a project to bypass assemblers when generating LTO object files. Link Time Optimization (LTO) enables GCC to dump its internal representation (GIMPLE) to disk so that a single executable can be optimized as a single module. The current implementation creates an assembly file, and the assembler creates the final LTO object file from the provided binary contents. This project aims to create Link-time-optimization (LTO) object files directly from the compiler to improve compile time performance significantly by bypassing the assembler. The GCC's LTO infrastructure has matured enough to compile large real-world applications. Thus, this project will significantly reduce their compile time once completed.\nIn this presentation, I will discuss the current state of my project and future direction. Additionally, I will delve into my journey, discussing the challenges I encountered as a beginner working with GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) and how I overcame them with the community's help.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Many GNU Linux distributions start their own bootstrap process with a set of binary seeds. Because, how do you build a modern C/C++ compiler without a C/C++ compiler? To solve this chicken-and-egg problem, an approach taken by some distributions is to rely on opaque, pre-build binaries. However, in order to increase trustworthiness in software, we should be able to produce every part of it from source, or at least reduce the size of the initial binary seed to the absolute minimum.</p>\n<p>In the bootstrappable builds movement, the GCC version 4.7 plays an important role: it is the last GCC version that can be built with only a C compiler. Therefore, this compiler is a stepping stone for bootstrapping everything that relies on the C++ language and above. Another important metric for trustworthiness is the capability to build reproducibly, independently of the build directory, which we addressed with patches, as it is not a native feature of this compiler version. Furthermore, additional patches were required for bringing this compiler version up to date, i.e., adding support for more recent C libraries (e.g., the musl libc) and for obtaining a compiler installation that works independently of its install prefix.</p>\n<p>We would like to present a build description (for the <em>JustBuild</em> build system), used to patch and bootstrap a GCC version 4.7 on a minimal x86_64 Linux system, which only needs a POSIX shell, coreutils, and a C library (GNU, musl) installed. To achieve this, the bootstrap process starts by building Busybox, GNU Make, and Binutils from scratch before those are used to bootstrap GCC 4.7. We can furthermore show how that compiler can then be used to bootstrap additional build tools (Make, CMake, Python) and even the most recent compilers (GCC 13.2, Clang 17), all from source on the exact same minimal system. In doing so, we basically bootstrap an extremely minimalistic Linux distribution for building compiler toolchains. All of that is strictly defined within a single <em>JustBuild</em> project, which is publicly available under an open-source license at: https://github.com/just-buildsystem/bootstrappable-toolchain.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Most of the day to day tests in LLVM are regression tests executed by Lit, structured as source code or IR to be passed to some binary, rather than test code directly calling the code to be tested. This has many advantages but can make it difficult to predict which code path is executed when the compiler is invoked with a certain test input, especially for edge cases where error handling is involved. The goal of this work was to help developers create good test coverage for their patch and enable reviewers to verify that they have done so. To accomplish this we have introduced a tool that can be fed a patch as input, add coverage instrumentation for the affected source files, runs Lit tests, and records which test cases cause each counter to be executed. For each counter we then report the test cases executing the counter, but perhaps more importantly we also report the test cases executing the counter that are also changed in some way by the patch, since a modified line that results in zero counter isn’t properly tested, unless it’s intended to be a non-functional change.</p>\n<p>In this presentation, we will understand what are the technologies involved, the shortcomings to implement the solution, the idea of implementation, and the final demo result by using a llvm-project patch.</p>",

Right now, it is a complete desktop system that is already used by many, with a familiar GNOME interface and thousands of packages, targeting 5 CPU architectures. In this talk I would like to focus on my experiences using the toolchain, what obstacles got in the way, how I dealt with them, the issues that are still left and I would like to see addressed, the many benefits using LLVM gave the project, and overall give the audience an insight into practical deployment of LLVM in a project where it isn't simply a drop-in alternative to GCC.</p>",

It is commonly located found as <code>compilation_database.json</code> in the build directory. With tools like <a href=\"https://github.com/Sarcasm/compdb\">compdb</a>, you can modify the file according to your needs. <code>clangd</code> itself provides a flexible configuration file. But what if you require more flexibility or have specific needs for your code base?</p>\n<p>In this introductory presentation I give a brief overview of how Clang utilizes the compilation database and discuss the reasons and methods for extending it. Clang's <code>CompilationDatabasePlugin</code> allows extending and modifying compilation commands directly in your tooling at runtime. I show an example plugin that uses custom heuristics to find compiler flags for unknown files, e.g. for header files.</p>\n<p>Plugins can interface with other Clang and LLVM components and writing one is a great way to get started writing Clang-based tooling.</p>",

Thus, the project must support multiple versions of LLVM spanning form LLVM 9 to LLVM 14 and soon more recent versions. This talk focuses on mechanisms and practices that we use to support changes and inconsistencies between various versions of LLVM's unstable C++ API.</p>\n<p>The presentation will also cover our plans for supporting newer LLVM versions. The challenge of upgrading to most recent versions comes from major API changes originating from the shift to opaque pointers in LLVM-IR. Due to the nature of GPU workloads, IGC must support a number of domain-specific types (textures, samplers) which were modelled internally as typed pointers.</p>\n<p>The aim of the presentation is to share our experience with other maintainers and developers of LLVM-based projects.</p>\n<p>Intel Graphics Compiler is available here: https://github.com/intel/intel-graphics-compiler/</p>",

This compiler generates an LLVM bitcode that translates every instruction of the original ELF binary based on remill (library for lifting machine code to LLVM IR) and uses emscripten to generate the WASM binary. we can execute the generated WASM binary using Wasm Runtime (e.g. Wasmedge, Wasmtime). This talk will describe the technical details (methods to translate to LLVM bitcode and emulate Linux syscall targeting WASM) of elfconv and the performance of translating and future perspectives.\nRepository URL : https://github.com/yomaytk/elfconv</p>",

We are especially interested in using this interface to map addresses used in load/store instructions to equivalent source-level memory references.\nThe primary objective of this project is to enhance the effectiveness of compiler-generated remarks and analysis reports for code optimization. These messages, while often comprehensive, lack direct connections to the corresponding source-level expressions. The goal is to bridge this gap by utilizing LLVM's intrinsic functions, which establish mappings between LLVM program entities and source-level expressions. The project specifically focuses on utilizing these intrinsic functions to generate or derive source expressions from LLVM values. This functionality is particularly important for enhancing memory access optimizations, including the reporting of memory access dependences that hinder vectorization.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Open source code is the main concern for SBOMs. So, why are so many of the available solutions proprietary software or proprietary data? </p>\n<p>Use DejaCode instead! DejaCode is a new open source tool to manage all your SBOMs in one place and ensure software supply chain integrity:\n- Export, import, merge, and combine SBOMs, with detailed attribution documentation and custom reports in multiple file formats and standards, like SPDX.\n- Apply usage policies and curated catalogs to enforce the consistent use of open source packages across teams and projects for licenses, provenance, and vulnerabilities.\n- Run reports and analytics with a consistent view of packages, licenses, and security risks across products.</p>\n<p>In this talk, Philippe will discuss how DejaCode enables low-effort, low-friction open source compliance automation across teams with different mandates - all while using open source software.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>The Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) has frequently been cited as a crucial component in securing the software supply chain. Its value proposition is the ability to answer critical questions such as, \"Am I vulnerable to CVE-XYZ?\". In theory, SBOM should simplify risk assessment by prioritizing the remediation of vulnerable applications. However, when considering the software supply chain as a whole and the myriad potential threat vectors (https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/threats), it's clear that SBOM provides limited utility when securing end-2-end software delivery from producer to consumer.</p>\n<p>How is an SBOM produced? How is it delivered? Does it bundle the artifacts it describes? Can you verify the provenance of the SBOM? These questions lead us to ask whether the SBOM has any real utility as a standalone entity.</p>\n<p>In this session, we shall introduce the Open Component Model (OCM, https://ocm.software), an open standard and tooling that supports establishing a secure software supply chain, from producer to consumer. OCM's dedicated tooling packages security and compliance-relevant metadata, such as SBOMs, alongside the software artifacts. It includes support for signing operations, as well as secure transport of artifacts ensuring their integrity and provenance. Our session is ideal for those who find these questions intriguing and are eager to explore possible answers!</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>In 2022 the Department of Homeland Security, an agency of the US government, announced the formation of an SBOM task force, formed by seven startup companies with a mission to create basic building blocks for the software bill of materials ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Out of this effort, the protobom project was born. </p>\n<p>Protobom is a project that offers a universal, format-neutral SBOM I/O layer designed to work with SBOM data in a unified way. The project frees developers from caring about the nuisance of ingesting and writing SBOMs. Through a single interface, applications can handle any SBOM format when reading, writing and transforming the data. Protobom is defined in protocol buffers which makes it ideal for storing and transmitting SBOM data. It also means that the project is multilanguage.</p>\n<p>On top of the I/O layer, protobom has a rich graph API helping developers query, remix, diff and filter information read from SBOMs. The project is young, but it is already at the core of various supply chain security projects under the OpenSSF umbrella, including SBOMit and OpenVEX.</p>\n<p>Join us and explore how protobom abstracts and puts SBOMs at your fingertips!</p>",

But if you don’t get fresh, quality ingredients delivered daily, the taste and hygiene of the food will suffer and the restaurant won’t be successful.

From 2023 the YP's reference distribution, Poky, is generating it by default in each distribution build. With numerous questions posted about the feature, it seems that many people are using it.</p>\n<p>The story does not end here, however. Joshua and Marta will explain the experience of SPDX 2.2, elements that worked and those that did not. The year 2023 has brought also the proof-of-concept implementation of the upcoming SPDX 3.0 addressing pain points of 2.2 and adding new features. This will be the other part of this talk: the proposed architecture, expected new features and decisions to be made on the actual data to output to make the SBoM the most useful for users.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>With SBOMs being required and SPDX meeting ISO/IEC 5962:202. It is beneficial for developers to adopt SPDX to generate the SBOM for their software. However, with AL and ML taking more and more centre stage in modern applications, how can we make sure SPDX can be useful to AI/ML applications?</p>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>Recently since the bill from the US government has made SBOM the standard in software distributions, all developers have started to think about how they can automate and generate SBOM with all the components stated as required. SPDX is one of the obvious choices for all as its specification is recognized as the international open standard for security.</p>\n<p>The stable release of SPDX 2.3 is good enough for most applications. Looking forward, as modern software applications are getting more and more complicated and there are more and more components involved - with the popularity of big data and AI/ML, many applications will involve data and data pipelines. These would need to be considered when generating SBOM in the future. </p>\n<p>In this talk, we will look into what has SPDX 2.3 achieved, what is added in SPDX 3.0 for data and AI, and how we can encourage the AI/Ml community to consider SPDX in their applications.</p>\n<h2>Goal</h2>\n<p>Bring awareness of SBOM and SPDX to the developers and data community. Suggest some strategies in getting more adoption, especially the adoption of SPDX 3.0 to AI/ML communities.</p>\n<h2>Target Audiences</h2>\n<p>Developers and engineers who work with data. Community leaders who are interested in encouraging the community to build safer software.</p>\n<h2>Outline</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Introduction of SBOM and SPDX</li>\n<li>What SPDX 2.3 has achieved and why it is a good tool</li>\n<li>What is new in SPDX 3.0 and why they are needed</li>\n<li>How to get the AI/ML and data community to adopt SPDX 3.0</li>\n<li>Conclusion and Q&amp;A</li>\n</ul>",

    "abstract": "<p>Creating and maintaining a safety critical project comes with a lot of challenges. One central issue is keeping your documentation, starting from planning and guideline documents, down to requirements, safety analysis, reviews and tests, consistent and up to date. These project artefacts often have their own lifecycle and are natively managed in different tools, with usually great traceability capabilities regarding dependencies between these artefacts as long as you stay within one tool or within a (usually propriety) tool family of one single tool vendor. Currently the resulting traceability gaps between these tools are handled either by the popular engineering tools like MS Excel or methods like “search for identical names”, depending highly on manual maintenance. \nUsing SPDX relationships, the upcoming Safety Profile in SPDX 3.1 will provide a model to represent all these dependencies as a knowledge model that can be used both to analyse possible impacts after a change (be it because of a security update or functional variants of your product), provide evidence of completeness and compliance as a Safety SBOM or simply keep track of your product variants.\nIn this talk we will provide both an introduction to the SPDX Safety Profile as well as a real life example using StrictDoc and the Zephyr Project’s Functional Safety scope.</p>",

It takes a variety of inputs including binaries and SBOMs (both SPDX and CycloneDX are supported). Our build process has been generating a SBOM (a build/deploy version using SBOM4Python (https://github.com/anthonyharrison/sbom4python)) every week and storing it within the GitHub repo. A detailed  analysis of the generated SBOMs over the past 12 months has identified a number of interesting observations which were not immediately apparent before SBOMs were being generated. It addresses some key questions such as “How much  does an SBOM change and how often?“ and “ Does your SBOM depend on your environment?“. This presentation shares these observations and provides a number of recommendations to be followed when generating SBOMs as part of the build process.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>The increasing use of AI-driven Python libraries necessitates robust scanning of Python projects for vulnerabilities. However, Python's dynamic typing and reliance on manifest files for dependency management make it challenging to detect hidden \"phantom\" dependencies. These unreported dependencies introduce uncertainty and risk into software composition analysis, as seen in OpenAI's baseline codebase. This session explores program analysis, particularly reachability analysis, to expose these phantom dependencies and create accurate dependency sets. Despite the challenges posed by Python's dynamic nature, program analysis remains crucial for secure and reliable software development. Understanding phantom dependencies and their impact is vital for Python developers to build robust and secure software.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>SBOM and VEX represent an important step towards managing software products and software vulnerabilities more efficiently and effectively. The accelerating development of standards and tooling is driven by the promise to answer one important question: Which of the thousands of CVEs published per year affect a given software product?</p>\n<p>However, the mere presence of such documents can lull consumers into a false sense of security. Studies have shown that the accuracy of SBOM and VEX documents greatly varies from one producer to another.</p>\n<p>The production of accurate SBOM and VEX documents requires connecting products to components, components to vulnerabilities and vulnerabilities to (vulnerable) functions. But establishing those connections is hindered by development practices, the dynamics of open source projects, low-quality vulnerability databases and other factors… </p>\n<p>This talk provides a deep dive into the brittleness of those connections, supported by real-world examples from the Java/Maven ecosystem. This information helps SBOM and VEX consumers to ask the right questions when it comes to evaluating and comparing tools and vendors.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>A major advantage of FOSS is the possibility to reuse existing components. Thus, it seems obvious to adopt the same strategy for FOSS compliance material in those areas where the required efforts are identical for all users of the software. With standard formats, such as SPDX, it is possible to share the results of data curation with the community, and thereby reduce the individual effort. The OSSelot project has set itself precisely this task: Creating a publicly available database of curated compliance materials for frequently used FOSS components including SPDX reports for each component. In order to foster usability of the data and external contributions, aspects such as trustworthiness, liability and integration of the data into existing tools must also be considered. </p>\n<p>This presentation will demonstrate the stringent curation and review process of the OSSelot data that ensures that all internal and external contributions meet the same high quality standard. It will also exemplify how the OSSelot resources can be used to fulfill FOSS license obligations. To increase the project’s practical relevance, a discussion is encouraged on how the data can be used with existing tools and what adaptions are required to do so.</p>\n<p>OSSelot project page: https://www.osselot.org/\nOSSelot git repo: https://github.com/Open-Source-Compliance/package-analysis</p>",

    "url": "https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/event/fosdem-2024-3164-the-case-for-inventoring-corresponding-source-in-sboms/",
    "abstract": "<p>SBOMs focus basically exclusively on binary distributions.  For years, copyleft activists like me have argued vehemently that they are non-functional in addressing the primary license compliance and software security problem that plagues FOSS distributions: an inability to clearly identify, and assure that all in the supply chain receive, the complete, corresponding source for the binaries in question.</p>\n<p>Due to the heavy influence and control on SBOM dialogue asserted by proprietary software companies and their business model proponents, proposals to require source code disclosures as a necessary part of the supply chain have typically been rejected.  In short, SBOM focus has been to ease the ingestion of FOSS into proprietary supply chains, rather than assuring that downstream users are afforded the same rights to examination, modification, and reinstallation of FOSS that their upstreams enjoyed.  Most will argue, perhaps correctly, that the ship of universal software freedom has sailed, the industry doesn't want to be on it, so why continue to debate that question in the context of SBOMs and (the mostly proprietary) software supply chains in our world today.</p>\n<p>This talk, then, proposes a simple compromise.  Given the non-viability of convincing proprietary software companies that control the supply chains to actually give software rights and freedom to their users and join the Open Source world, what (this talk considers) is a requirement for SBOMs that might improve the situation for downstream users with regard to complete, corresponding source code provisioning, but would not require companies to participate in actual open source releases?</p>\n<p>I will propose in this talk a thought experiment of how we might add key information about the supply chain of the source code that produced the binaries into SBOMs without requiring actual source-code disclosure.  While such an addition would be woefully inadequate to assist in compliance with copyleft licenses, it would (a) marginally improve the forensic data available to those trapped at the end of the supply chain desperate to, for example, determine whether they are vulnerable to the latest security bug and (b) provide at least a basic breadcrumbs for those who are testing copyleft compliance of products at the end of the supply chain.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Accessibility is a key requirement in modern web applications — not only because of new legislative requirements (like the European Accessibility Act), but because it is also a human right and a cornerstone of an inclusive society.</p>\n<p>This presentation aims to shed light on the on the different kinds of barriers a user might encounter in a modern web application (especially in the context of the \"usual suspects\" of content management systems like <a href=\"https://wordpress.org\">Wordpress</a> or <a href=\"https://typo3.org\">TYPO3</a>), and also show that there are some barriers that all users may encounter, regardless of their physical or mental ability. Instead, some barriers may arise from the technology available to a user (who possibly only has access to a low-end device, works with a spotty network connection or does not have access to a required input device), the education of a user, their language comprehension and many other factors. We will explore key accessibility principles to allow users to overcome these barriers and share real-world practical examples to illustrate the impact of accessible design on user experience and inclusivity.</p>\n<p>We will provide actionable strategies for developers and UX designers to enhance accessibility working with or on these CMS frameworks. Attendees will gain insights into optimizing software and content for diverse user needs, ensuring compliance with global accessibility standards and regulatory requirements (like the European Accessibility Act), and leveraging the latest technologies to create a more inclusive digital landscape.</p>",

In comparison, Drupal has historically had no centralised product management or marketing, let alone ANY coordinated budget! This talk will look at the challenges Drupal is facing now that it competes head to head with proprietary giants like Adobe in the enterprise sector. From the perspective of his role on the Drupal Association board, Owen will discuss the strategies and initiatives the Drupal community is starting to put in place to remain competitive and how these approaches can be shared by other open source projects.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>In 2018, Rwanda engaged in standardizing all the websites of the public institutions starting with the government, using a community-based CMS, TYPO3. Following a comprehensive approach for the first time attempted in a developing country, it relied on local technical capacity to achieve digital sovereignty and to provide sustainable new jobs and opportunities for Rwandan web developers. \nThe model is now taken forward by the GovStack Global initiative created by ITU and GIZ, which is proposing to create a global open standard and a methodology for the strategic adoption of open source CMS technologies in the public sector all over the world. This project is designed as a collaborative effort, open to volunteer participation from open source CMS communities that are interested to contribute.</p>",

These environments can be used for interactive data analysis or running pipelines in a CI/CD environment. Environments built with Nix contain R and all the required packages that you need for your project: there are currently more than 80.000 pieces of software available through the Nix package manager, including the entirety of CRAN and Bioconductor packages. The Nix package manager is extremely powerful: it not only handles all the dependencies of any package extremely well, it is also possible with it to reproduce environments containing old releases of software. It is thus possible to build environments that contain R version 4.0.0 (for example) to run an old project originally developed on that version of R.</p>\n<p>With Nix, it is essentially possible to replace {renv} and Docker combined. If you need other tools or languages like Python or Julia, this can also be done easily. Nix is available for Linux, macOS and Windows (via WSL2).</p>",

Scraped and otherwise stolen datasets are used to produce output that can directly compete with the people who generated the source data. This doesn’t have to be our future. The Common Voice project collects volunteer donated speech data to freely offer academics, industry and language activists a future where meaningful linguistic diversity is built into the digital products and services that increasingly fill our world. By teaching computers the way that real people speak, Common Voice doesn’t just offer a better connected future for global users, but presents us with one possible consent led model for community driven data collection. Together, let’s explore how community led dataset collection, design and governance structures have developed across speech datasets and look at how freely donated data, data trusts and other consent led collection models could offer a less dystopian AI future.\nAn exploratory look at the proliferation of consent led data collection models in speech datasets, looking not only at Common Voice's CC0 donation-led approach but also looking into how data collection and governance models that offer more granular data control (like language community led data trusts) could offer AI and all of us touched by AI a less dystopian path into the future.</p>",

This diversity often hampers effective information exchange within Building Information Modeling (BIM). </p>\n<p>At the same time, it's worth noting that open-source CAD/CAM has limited options when it comes to available geometry libraries. In the latest version of IfcOpenShell, a combination of OpenCASCADE and CGAL is used to realize the best of both worlds in terms of performance, expressiveness and robustness. The presenter also uses voxelization and trees of halfspaces to cater to specific requirements.</p>\n<p>This presentation describes challenges by various disciplines in the construction sector and explores solutions by leveraging a diverse ecosystem of open-source geometry libraries and discusses the benefits and challenges of a hybrid usage of geometry libraries.</p>",

How does a satellite stay safe during launch and what happens after they leave their final home, right before starting their mission in orbit?\nThe answer is revealed during this talk.</p>\n<p>PICOBUS, developed by the Libre Space Foundation, is an 8p PocketQube satellite deployer. It's a groundbreaking open-source deployer capable of storing and deploying up to 8 PocketQube Units while in orbit.</p>\n<p>The first PICOBUS deployer was manufactured to fly onboard the maiden flight of Firefly Aerospace's Alpha rocket, carrying two sets of QUBIK satellites, which are our very own open-source PocketQube satellites.\nThe first launch faced a setback with an explosion shortly after liftoff, posing a threat to our deployer and satellites. However, an interesting turn of events followed! This will be discussed during this talk.</p>\n<p>The second launch attempt on October 1, 2022, was a success. PICOBUS flawlessly deployed all the satellites into space, marking a significant achievement for the open-source community. It's a rare instance of open-source technology making it to orbit, which is quite remarkable.</p>\n<p>Over the past year, Libre Space Foundation has been working on the second version of PICOBUS. This updated version is a more adaptable and lighter design, incorporating various advanced features and mechanisms to enhance its capabilities.</p>\n<p>During this talk, we will discuss all about open source in space, the open source tools used to achieve that and the difficulties faced during this journey.</p>\n<p>Our Vision is an Open and Accessible Outer Space for all. We believe that space should be claimed the libre (open source) way.\nOur Mission is to promote, advance and develop libre (free and open source) technologies and knowledge for space. To do that we design, develop and deliver space related projects ranging from Ground Station equipment to global monitoring Networks and of course, satellites!</p>",

So to prepare from your KiCad project all programs to run on these machines is really time consuming. Later on the machine jobs changeovers there are also source of machine operator errors.\nWe are dealing with electronic production for more than 30 years and we are constantly improving our process to avoid stupid mistakes and make the different machine programming easy and predictable process. \nKiCad scripting is nice tool to automate all this boring stuff and I will share our experience with you.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>In the world of cloud-based software, developers enjoy the advantage of <strong>fully automated testing</strong>. Continuous Integration (CI) systems check every software update, testing every part of the software. However, this level of automated testing hasn't been easy for embedded software and devices. The main reason is their <strong>dependence on specific physical hardware</strong>, which traditionally requires manual testing by a person. This manual approach is slow and becomes more challenging as the number of device variants grows.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://jumpstarter.dev\">Jumpstarter</a></strong> was created to help with that. It introduces <strong>a way to test embedded software automatically</strong>, just like cloud software. With Jumpstarter, we can test our software on the actual hardware it will run on, but without needing someone to manually handle the device for each test. This is a big step forward because it makes testing faster, more consistent, and less reliant on manual effort. <strong>It fits right into existing CI/CD systems</strong> like <em>GitHub CI</em>, <em>GitLab CI</em>, <em>Jenkins</em>, <em>Tekton</em>, <em>etc..</em>, making it easier for developers to include it in their workflow.</p>\n<p>Testing in hardware requires a <strong>testing harness</strong> to connect your hardware to Jumpstarter, as we couldn't find anything readily available and Open; this is why we also created the <a href=\"https://jumpstarter.dev/docs/testharness/jumpstarterboard/\">jumpstarter-board</a> that allows power control and metering, storage flashing, console access, and other functions. We are working on the release 2.0.0 with additional functionality and expandability. Additionally, the Jumpstarter software is designed with a <strong>driver architecture</strong> that enables the creation of drivers for additional testing harnesses.</p>\n<p>This talk will explain how Jumpstarter makes embedded software testing easier and more efficient. We'll explain how it can save time and ensure better testing results, which is crucial for developing reliable embedded systems.</p>\n<p>We will bring the Jumpstarter board with us and share details to let you build your own or get it built for you.</p>",

Braille embosser succesfully re-built in many countries, from Argentina to Buthan, passing by France, Belgium and Cameroun.</p>\n<p>From the first prototype in early 2018 to the lastest version in 2023, we will discuss about what failed and what was great improvments. We will focus on the documentation and assembly guide, one of the most important topic of the project.</p>\n<p>At the end we will discuss about Workshop to build BrailleRAP. In most aspect, BrailleRAP is a Fablab standard workshop, with an exception, you need a Braille reader to validate the build. And most of Braille reader are unsighted !

However, creating documentation and keeping it up-to-date is often challenging and time-intensive.  In this presentation we present OSH Automated Documentation, a system that relates the CAD design semantically to a textual specification from which we generate assembly instructions semi-automatically.  Our system makes use of a FreeCAD workbench and a compiler that closely interact to create high-quality Ikea-style assembly instructions.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Subtitle: Continuous Evolution Keeps 1960s Technology Alive</p>\n<p>Short Abstract:</p>\n<p>M is a conceptually simple language tightly coupled to a conceptually simple database. Originally developed in the mid to late 1960s, the technology has evolved to stay relevant in the 21st century. The talk reviews the history of the technology, the conceptual simplicity of both the M language and M database, and how the technology survives by evolving to adapt to the changing world of computing. Portability was a goal since its earliest days.</p>\n<p>Longer Description:</p>\n<p>M first ran on a PDP-7 and was a complete software stack: an operating system, a database, and a language. To run on such limited hardware, M seamlessly coupled a minimalistic database with a minimalistic language. It was based on a small number of concepts.</p>\n<p>Fast forward more than a half century. While M is not mainstream software technology, it is the language and database of the largest real-time core-banking and electronic medical record systems. For example, a nation-scale medical record system in Jordan runs a complete FOSS stack developed in M. To robustly and securely serve such large-scale, mission-critical systems that require \"five nines\" availability, M has retained its core principles of a minimalistic language and efficient implementation, which allows it to scale down as well as up: the YottaDB implementation of M delivers thousands of database accesses per second even on a Raspberry Pi Zero with a consumer grade MicroSD card.</p>\n<p>To remain relevant with changing economics and technology, M had to evolve. It moved from days when the cost of the hardware dominated, programmers were economical, and software was freely bundled with the hardware, to today. It has done so without compromising its foundational values. It ceased to be an operating system as it was ported to other computing platforms. A production grade implementation was released under a copyleft license in 2000/2001. While the M language retains its conceptual simplicity, the tight coupling of M, the language, with M, the database, now extends to other languages, C, Go, JavaScript, Lua, Perl, PHP, Python, and Rust. The talk will use examples from lua-yottadb, which tightly binds a highly capable minimalistic language and a highly capable minimalistic database.</p>\n<p>Links:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Project base: https://gitlab.com/YottaDB</li>\n<li>Source code for database with M anc C APIs: https://gitlab.com/YottaDB/DB/YDB</li>\n<li>Source code for Lua API: https://github.com/anet-be/lua-yottadb</li>\n<li>Source code for G, Python, Rust APIs: https://gitlab.com/YottaDB/Lang</li>\n<li>Source code for Perl API: https://gitlab.com/oesiman/yottadb-perl</li>\n<li>Source code for PHP API: https://github.com/chrisemunt/mg_php</li>\n<li>Source code for three JavaScript APIs: https://github.com/chrisemunt/mg-dbx-napi / https://github.com/dlwicksell/nodem / https://github.com/chrisemunt/mg-dbx</li>\n<li>User documentation (GNU FDL): https://yottadb.com/resources/documentation/</li>\n<li>Company home page: https://yottadb.com/</li>\n</ul>",

This will lead to a scale of things\nthat will become incomprehensible by mere mortals if we apply current\nday approaches.  The main reasons for the predicted\nincomprehensibility are: combinatory logic complexities, further\nconflated by state and concurrency.

So the question is: how much math can we fit in 700K.</p>\n<p>This year, I would like to demonstrate what already works, including support for variable precision numbers (integers and decimal numbers), based numbers, complex numbers, vectors and matrices, symbolic computations, numerical integration and solving, engineering units, plots and charts, data processing, and quasi-complete support for RPL programming and debugging.</p>\n<p>The focus of the talk would be on how to use C++ to write really compact and efficient code, notably three interesting points:</p>\n<p>1/ C++ and garbage collection? Huh? (The DB48X object model)</p>\n<p>2/ Using template meta-programming to generate data tables representing symbolic expressions and RPL programs</p>\n<p>3/ Performance tuning vs. code space</p>\n<p>I will also share some of the funniest or most interesting bugs I ran into (e.g.: It runs on USB power, but halts when on battery)</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>As free software programmers, whether we like it or not, we often host our projects on large centralized and proprietary software forges such as GitHub. In theory, it is perfectly possible to host our own forges using free software such as GitLab, Gitea, etc. But, life is short, and setup and maintenance of these services is more work than it seems at first.</p>\n<p>GNU Guix is well-known as a package manager, for the high quality of its packages, and for the strong reproducibility guarantees it provides. But, it is much less appreciated for its services, system definitions and deployment features. That's such a shame since these features can let you summon and dismiss entire systems at will—be they bare-metal or virtualized—with nothing but a declarative plain text configuration file.</p>\n<p>In this talk, I will speak about guix-forge, a Guix channel that provides Guix services for easy setup and maintenance of a software forge. guix-forge uses existing free software such as cgit and/or klaus for serving git repositories on the web, laminar and webhook for continuous integration, uacme for managing TLS certificates, etc.</p>",

From a being just a wild idea back in 2019, the language has grown into a small community of users (roughly measured by its ~1.8k GitHub stars). With growth, the language's strengths and weaknesses became more evident, and with those come feature requests. How to keep the language small and still address the needs of users, while remaining faithful to the spirit of Lua and not falling into pitfalls from the past? In this talk we'll discuss some pragmatic choices in Teal's design that were made to balance those concerns: to make it more powerful, while keeping it small.</p>",

In contrast, public administration has a de facto monopoly on many services that require social, medical and other information that is vulnerable to stigmatization.</p>\n<p>Some governments have created their own custom-built solutions where communication takes place via insecure services with no end-to-end-encryption in place.</p>\n<p>The German identity system BundID, for example, contains a communication component that stores unencrypted messages on central servers. This poses a major risk to privacy in the event of IT security incidents.</p>\n<p>If all goes well, Germany's infrastructure might get an upgrade and will use Matrix as its new communication protocol in the future (see https://gitlab.opencode.de/fitko/rueckkanal-ueber-messengerdienste)</p>\n<p>In this talk, I would like to discuss the benefits and need for an open, end-to-end-encrypted messaging protocol for building secure (cross-border) communication platforms for the public administration.

But matrix events which get stored on the homeserver are not suitable for actual real time applications. In this talk we give a brief description of our vision for MatrixRTC which would pave the way for RTC applications such as group calls in your matrix client, a whole collaborative office suite, security/webcam feeds, games, etc. </p>\n<p>To realize this vision matrix needs a standardized signaling system for establishing real time (WebRTC) connections between all participants and allow to exchange media and data streams. </p>\n<p>In this talk we will present the journey of building <a href=\"https://github.com/vector-im/element-call\">Element Call</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/krille-chan/fluffychat\">FluffyChat</a> as MatrixRTC applications for group calls and present the findings we made to make this a stable extensible and secure infrastructure that leverages all the amazing features of matrix.</p>\n<p>We will give a technical introduction to the MSC's making up MatrixRTC and explain the decisions made. We will also explain how we implemented it in FluffyChat and how it integrates with native mobile operating systems like Android and iOS.</p>\n<p>Interoperability between <a href=\"https://github.com/vector-im/element-call\">Element Call</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/krille-chan/fluffychat\">FluffyChat</a> for group calls just became possible a couple of days ago. We want to share this milestone for this new part of matrix. \nSince its all built ontop of matix the matrix-calls feature account verification and per sender encryption to not only guarantee that the streams are shared securely but also the authenticity of participants. Which makes it one of the most secure digital real time communication method.</p>",

However, for historical reasons, TLS for email protocols is often not used directly but negotiated via STARTTLS. This additional negotiation added complexity and was prone to security vulnerabilities such as naive STARTTLS stripping or command injection attacks in the past.</p>\n<p>We performed the first structured analysis of STARTTLS in SMTP, POP3, and IMAP and introduced a semi-automatic testing toolkit (EAST) to analyze email clients. We used EAST to analyze 28 email clients and 23 email servers, resulting in over 40 STARTTLS related issues. Only 3 out of 28 clients and 7 out of 23 servers did not show any STARTTLS-specific security issues. We conclude that STARTTLS is error-prone to implement, under-specified in the standards, and should be avoided.</p>",

Above that, the syntax is intertwined with business logic, making separating concerns difficult. It doesn't help either that there are more than 70 extensions, with any of them potentially breaking your understanding of how IMAP operates.</p>\n<p>In this talk, Simon and Damian recapitulate what they learned about IMAP while implementing/maintaining <a href=\"https://github.com/emersion/go-imap\">go-imap</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/duesee/imap-codec\">imap-codec</a>.</p>\n<p>After the talk, you will have a much better understanding of IMAP and, hopefully, will avoid making the same mistakes we made.</p>\n<h1>About the speaker(s)</h1>\n<p>Simon started writing go-imap v1 7 years ago. Of course, misunderstandings happened, and mistakes were made. Thus, he started working on go-imap v2 earlier this year to fix these mistakes and design a better API informed on everything he learned while maintaining this library.</p>\n<p>Damian started imap-codec during a STARTTLS research project. imap-codec was born out of frustration. He struggled to construct syntactically valid IMAP messages while analyzing IMAP clients for a specific behavior. imap-codec helped to prevent the same errors from being made twice.</p>",

On top of the classic mail server stack, we implemented APIs and protocols of Microsoft's Exchange (and later MS 365 server) in free, opensource versions, one by one.\nThis way, we built a \"drop-in\"-replacement for MS Exchange that supports unmodified, plugin-free clients with Outlook, Android, Apple and Web clients out of the box. It comes with chat, video conferences, file sync, administration, domain, user and account management and much more. Most recently, we implemented Exchange Web Services.\nIn this talk, we will have a look at how we re-implemented the protocols and how it works with clients. We'll talk about problems, solutions and quirks of our work and the challenges of both supporting many older versions and following Microsoft's newest developments.\nOur support for Microsoft Exchange (and other) protocols follows the protocol specifications of EWS, EAS (Exchange ActiveSync), OXCRPC/OXCROPS, MAPI/HTTP and others.</p>",

The goal is to make it easy to run your own modern mail server, so you can stay in charge of your email and keep email decentralized! Mox handles SMTP including SPF/DKIM/DMARC/DANE/MTA-STS, IMAP4, ACME (TLS), junk filtering, webmail, Internationalization, autoconfig and more! All in a lean, consistent, tested code base, cross-referenced with RFCs. We'll look into how mox achieves its goals, have a quick demo, and dive into a few topics of modern email and software development, and look at the roadmap.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Helplines and NGOs working with sensitive populations in at-risk areas require a robust, secure but also usable communication tooling. They need to have a system that lets anyone contact them in a secure and pseudonymous way, without revealing who manages the hotline; they also need to be able to organize their internal workflow securely and safely enroll new members.</p>\n<p>We have conducted a user survey among grassroots helplines in Eastern Europe and identified several common traits: first, they rely on a patchwork of tools (messaging apps, cloud storage, task trackers) therefore multiplying potential vulnerabilities; second, they are critical towards popular secure messaging apps that either leak your phone numbers (e.g. Signal), or do not guarantee end-to-end encryption (e.g. Telegram) or may seem tricky to onboard for non-techies (e.g. Element). </p>\n<p>What we propose is a chat-mail service using Delta Chat messaging suite, adapted specifically for hotlines and NGOs. Delta Chat is a federated, crossplatform, free and open source messaging app that works over email and offers state of the art end-to-end encryption using Autocrypt and SecureJoin with multiple audits.</p>\n<p>During this presentation we will demonstrate how our chat-mail service can help high-risk user groups. We will specifically focus on instant onboarding, shared account management, account portability,  guaranteed end-to-end encryption and embedded collaborative chat-apps (\"webxdc\") such as notepads, calendars, task trackers etc. We will also share user stories from the field, since all these features are tested with real hotlines.</p>",

We finally sketch a way forward through ACME for S/MIME and present a prototypical implementation for Thunderbird.</p>\n<p>We bought certificates from all ten vendors of S/MIME certificates with their CA in Mozilla's Trust Store. For each vendor, we recorded the procurement process and analysed the time and clicks needed, the number of requests and their sizes, and the number of privacy invading third-party requests. Further, we checked on the privacy policies and adjacent documentation to count the number of words and analyse the readability of the necessary documents.</p>\n<p>Our results suggest that the market does not provide a satisfactory solution. The vendors either control your secret key, invade your privacy with well-known third-party trackers, or require a PhD to read their privacy policies. Some vendors did not even manage to create a valid certificate.</p>\n<p>The best way forward is to establish ACME for S/MIME which allows for a (n)one-click solution. We have created a prototype to show that this is technically feasible.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>The RUM Archive is the Real User Monitoring-focused counterpart to the synthetic results from the HTTP Archive. \nIt contains (aggregated and anonimized) measurements from millions of end users, as seen by the mPulse RUM tool on the Akamai CDN network. \nContaining over 1.5 years of data, the RUM Archive doesn't just provide insight into current real-world performance aspects, but also help us to understand trends and evolutions over time, for a variety of metrics and data dimensions.</p>\n<p>In this talk, we will first discuss how the RUM Archive works underneath; the data it holds and some examples on how to extract it yourself. \nWe then move to analyzing some of the data contained within, looking at differences between for example browsers, operating systems and devices, and how those can impact performance metrics. \nWe also discuss RUM-specific challenges, such as dealing with noise in the measurements, and show how this can make a big difference in the conclusions we draw from the data.</p>\n<p>We end with some critical discussion on the state of Web performance testing, emphasizing the need for both synthetic and RUM measurements, and taking a long hard look at our over-reliance on CrUX, the Google Core Web Vitals and Chromium.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>In the era of cloud systems, it is common practice to outsource most of our data. Consequently, vendors should incorporate several layers of security to ensure users' individual privacy. A typical solution is to protect data <em>at rest</em> by using encryption. To protect data <em>in use</em>, however, encryption is often considered impractical: encrypting and decrypting data at runtime incurs a significant computational overhead.</p>\n<p>As a remedy, there exist Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) that enable database developers to wrap computations in a protected area of the disk. However, the adoption of Open Source software employing TEE to protect data in use is not sufficiently widespread, and such technologies are mostly limited to prototypes. In addition, existing database implementations incorporating TEEs face significant performance issues due to the pitfalls and limitations of Intel SGX, the most commonly used architecture. </p>\n<p>In this talk, we present the current state of Open Source secure database implementations using TEEs. We will highlight the strengths and weaknesses of widely-known systems (SGX_SQLite, StealthDB, DuckDB) and discuss design choices developers face when using TEEs to secure data. We provide the results of the most recent benchmarks, which expose bottlenecks and tradeoffs. Lastly, we aim to bridge the gap between security and performance by porting our in-house embedded analytical system, DuckDB, to Intel SGX 2. We show preliminary results and open challenges to spread awareness of secure database technologies and encourage their discussion.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>A key component of Confidential Computing is the validation of TCB measurements using remote attestation.\nValidating these measurements requires a set of trusted reference values. But where do these opaque values come from? Today, they are often provided by a third party, without mechanisms for auditing the trustworthiness or origin of reference values.\nWe want to make CC offerings auditable, allowing end users to read the source code, reproduce binary artifacts, generate reference values from the artifacts and verify the deployed system (using remote attestation). Every part of the TCB needs to be open source and reproducible.\nWe will cover the status quo of how reference values are used in CC. We show what the main difficulties and sources of non-determinism are.\nBased on a minimal open source example, we explain how we build fully reproducible OS images with mkosi and nix - all the way from source code in Git to the reference values for remote attestation. The presented code is the base for images used in both <a href=\"https://github.com/edgelesssys/constellation\">Constellation</a> and the <a href=\"https://github.com/confidential-containers/confidential-containers\">Confidential Containers project</a>.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>The growing trend towards confidential computing has presented a significant challenge: making remote attestation, a crucial technology for establishing trust in confidential workloads, easily accessible to application developers. Ideally, leveraging the added transparency and security guarantees of attestation as an authentication mechanism should be simple. However, the current ecosystem often requires engineers to integrate remote attestation at the application layer of the network stack. This task is not only burdensome, diverting attention from core business logic, but also poses privacy risks. Developers are compelled to navigate a complex maze of security protocols, with the ever-present danger of accidentally exposing sensitive information about the devices running these workloads.</p>\n<p>Developing secure and easy-to-use building blocks requires a collaborative effort between the open-source and standards communities. The IETF is working on various specifications, which are being complemented by prototypes and formal verification of innovative features. Several Internet protocols, such as TLS, OAuth, ACME, Netconf, and CSR/EST, are already incorporating attestation, and others will follow. \nA key focus of our work is to integrate privacy-preserving techniques that can mitigate the risks inherent in remote attestation, ensuring that this crucial technology can be utilized in a manner that is both user-friendly and privacy-conscious.</p>\n<p>In this presentation, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the current standardization and open-source implementation initiatives. The goal is to make it easier for the broader community to access and engage in this new development, which is crucial for the advancement of the remote attestation infrastructure in general and the utilization of confidential computing in particular.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>C and C++ are consistently the preferred languages for systems programming, embedded systems, and various performance-critical applications. C and C++ are also susceptible to various defects, such as memory-safety issues, that account for a significant portion of security vulnerabilities in C and C++ software. Addressing the memory-safety challenge has recently received new focus as leading cybersecurity organizations from various countries have  collectively emphasized the significant risks posed by memory-safety issues.</p>\n<p>With the ubiquitous use of C and C++ in the embedded device, industrial controls, and IoT space, the chances of removing and replacing C and C++ are virtually nil. To improve software to be more memory-safe, a series of techniques will need to be undertaken to gradually evolve the quality and security of the code:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>migration to memory-safe alternatives, such as Rust, especially for critical software</li>\n<li>easier to use tooling for debugging, diagnostics and application security testing</li>\n<li>pro-active vulnerability mitigation and prevention in  software though the use of compiler-based binary hardening mechanisms</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In November 2023, the Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) published the <a href=\"https://best.openssf.org/Compiler-Hardening-Guides/Compiler-Options-Hardening-Guide-for-C-and-C++\">Compiler Options Hardening Guide for C and C++</a> that is focused on helping developers make informed choices regarding compiler options to harden their software against prevalent software defects. Compiler flags are powerful tools that can significantly enhance the security of C and C++ code without requiring expensive refactoring or rewriting in newer, more memory-safe languages. Many such compiler features are also useful for discovering memory safety issues during debugging and testing.</p>\n<p>In this talk, Thomas will give an introduction to the OpenSSF Compiler Options Hardening Guide for C and C++. He will talk about how the guide came into existence in the OpenSSF, its current structure and future extensions. This talk particularly intends to actively invite feedback and call for collaboration.</p>",

At that time, there was no easily available data.</p>\n<p>In this talk, I will share with you the story of how I was able to get in touch with the companies that had the data I needed, establish some rudimentary collaboration and produce a workable web app. Even though it only had three users, I still learned a lot, whether on human or technical aspects.</p>\n<p>The takeaways are the stereotypical fact that when you put your mind to something you can usually accomplish it, and  that unfortunately if you build it they won’t necessarily come.</p>",

Attendees will leave with a concrete roadmap for either creating their project homepage from scratch or improving the homepage they already have. The focus is on the written content of the website, not on the design.</p>",

To achieve this interactivity, Rill’s dashboards generate up to 100 parallel queries in response to each user interaction.</p>\n<p>In this lightning talk, we'll share a series of optimization and data modeling techniques that have been pivotal in achieving remarkably fast, sub-second response times using DuckDB.</p>\n<p>Our primary tactics include employing parallel connections to facilitate simultaneous query processing and organizing data in a chronological order to enhance the effectiveness of min-max indexes. We also utilize enum types for more efficient handling of string column queries, along with config tunings. These approaches have collectively enabled us to enhance DuckDB's capability to handle larger datasets (100+ GBs) with sub-second query responses.</p>\n<p>We invite you to join us in this insightful session to discover how these optimizations can significantly improve your data processing and query performance in DuckDB.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>For FOSDEM 2011 until 2023, <a href=\"https://github.com/nevs/pentabarf\">pentabarf</a> was used as the conference management system for FOSDEM. Unfortunately development of pentabarf stopped more or less the year before that which meant that FOSDEM was run on hardly maintained software for many years.</p>\n<p>Different attempts at switching to another conference management system failed, but for the 2024 edition we decided to switch to <a href=\"https://github.com/pretalx/pretalx\">pretalx</a>.</p>\n<p>But the scale of FOSDEM is quite different from other conferences which means that adjustments had to be made: not many conferences have 60 tracks maintained by different people and over 1700 submitted talks.</p>\n<p>This lightning talk will highlight how the system works, custom changes that were made and how I ended up spamming some FOSDEM speakers. But also things we would like to change for 2025 and we loved about pentabarf and how you can help. Also an invitation for users to join and give some feedback during the talk or afterwards in the hallways.</p>",

As usual, the devil is in the details, and these standards will substantially shape the future of software in Europe, and as a result, of open source.</p>\n<p>The problem?</p>\n<p>The EU standardization organizations which will be tasked with developing those standards (CEN-CENELEC and ETSI) are very formal structures that are as arcane and antithetical to open source communities as the EU legislative process itself was only a few months ago.</p>\n<p>There's a very serious risk that this upcoming standardization process might happen again with little or no consultation of the impacted open source communities and lead to additional harm as a result, further damaging Europe’s standing in the open source community and its ability to host, foster, contribute to, and leverage open source projects essential to its sovereignty.</p>\n<p>The goal of this session is to preempt this scenario by proactively engaging with policy makers and carving out a path forward that leads to better outcomes for both Europe and open source.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>This devroom is not like others! It is to develop future EU policy, with the help of open source code! </p>\n<p>We seek to stimulate a genuine and open discussion that will become the fuel for good legislation in the future. We are building workshops where accepted participants will be grouped together with EU policy experts for a journey from the current state to a future state in each topic area. We aim to produce a report in each policy area arising from each workshop.</p>\n<p>During this workshop experts from the European Commission will try to get inputs from the open source community on how to efficiently build interoperability between digital services, required by EU law, with the help of open source software and OSS businesses and developers. </p>\n<p>Our audience will then be involved in a brainstorming session on the reality of open source and its capabilities to build interoperability between digital services. The session is led by Amandine le Pape, and will include the rapporteur feedback for the overall workshop from Simon Phipps.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Implementing telemetry well is hard.  On the one hand, some projects would like to know as much as possible about their users so they can focus their development efforts where they would be the most effective.  On the other hand users are rightly reluctant to give up what is their private data.  Data can range from configurations and use of features to performance.</p>\n<p>Numerous projects have tried, some more successfully than others.  The <a href=\"https://www.linuxfoundation.org/legal/telemetry-data-policy\">Linux Foundation's Telemetry and Data Collection Policy</a> provides one example of a framework for projects to operate within.  A recent example of the tensions can be seen in the <a href=\"https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/f40-change-request-privacy-preserving-telemetry-for-fedora-workstation-system-wide/85320\">discussions</a> following a proposal to introduce telemetry into the Fedora Desktop.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile various sophisticated techniques are being developed that try to square the circle of obtaining detailed telemetry while simultaneously preserving privacy and making it hard for people to deliberately skew the data.  One example is the IETF's <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-ppm-dap/\">Distributed Aggregation Protocol</a> and another is Google's <a href=\"https://research.google/pubs/rappor-randomized-aggregatable-privacy-preserving-ordinal-response/\">RAPPOR</a>.</p>\n<p>This session is an opportunity for projects interested in these developments to share experiences and consider what might be gained by collaboration.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>MAMBO is the first dynamic binary modification (DBM) tool optimized for 64-bit RISC-V (RV64GC) and Arm. DBM tools allow developers to inspect, instrument and even modify running binaries (for example to detect memory issues or trace executed instructions) by sitting in-between the operating system (OS) and user application. Examples of those tools include Intel PIN, DynamoRIO, MAMBO - subject of this talk. This talk presents MAMBO from the developer perspective, discussing how it can assist developers in implementing efficient dynamic binary analysis and instrumentation tools. The presentation describes MAMBO API - that provides callbacks invoked by the DBM tool at different points of the lifetime of the hosted application - and its plugin infrastructure, used to implement those callbacks and perform aforementioned tasks. This talk shows a number of concrete plugin examples and the live demo to present described capabilities in action.</p>",

What was originally a test framework for x86 KVM is now a test framework which can test KVM for five different architectures and bare-metal for two (and soon to be three). RISC-V support for kvm-unit-tests has recently been merged and its ability to run from EFI supporting bootloaders will be merged soon.  Since RISC-V is new to kvm-unit-tests, actual tests are missing, but it's expected that SBI tests will be getting added soon as kvm-unit-tests will be used for the SBI verification framework.  Furthermore, as QEMU is a popular platform for RISC-V developers, RISC-V kvm-unit-tests can already be used for TCG validation tests.  When the EFI support is merged, kvm-unit-tests will be able to do CPU validation as well, allowing tests to be run on both TCG and real hardware, possibly exposing that one or both are broken. We introduce RISC-V kvm-unit-tests and demonstrate a few tests in the hopes we'll encourage developers to write and post tests as SBI and ISA extensions evolve.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>\n<p>This presentation will talk about how SoCs can leverage Binman to simplify the overall boot-loader build flow. We use Texas Instruments (TI) K3 family of SoCs as an example, which, like many other SoCs today, use custom tools to build and sign their boot-loader binaries. However, U-Boot contains a powerful and flexible packaging tool Binman and this can be extended to sign and package even complex boot-loader images.</p>\n<p>The session outlines the challenges in maintaining and shipping custom tools for any sort of build, highlighting its limitations in scaling, maintaining consistency and accommodating evolving system requirements. This presentation shows the effort in leveraging Binman, moving towards a completely open-source solution that also simplifies the build using K3 devices as an example. We also aim to present how we can make Binman the standard when it comes to the developing boot-loaders for any OS. A few platforms such as Kontron i.MX8M and Renesas RZ/N1 already use Binman to package their boot-loader binaries but we see that there is a larger scope of pulling all platform packaging to the standard.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Description</strong></p>\n<p>The boot loader images involved in booting a TI K3 device to Linux are:\n- tiboot3.bin: containing SPL (Secondary Program Loader) for the R5 core, may include system firmware for certain devices\n- sysfw.itb: containing system firmware and board configuration binaries\n- u-boot.img: containing the U-Boot image that can load the final Linux kernel image</p>\n<p>In addition to the complexity of the <a href=\"https://u-boot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/board/ti/k3.html#boot-flow-overview\">K3 boot flow</a>, each boot-loader image is packaged differently according to the whether the device:\n- is a High-Security Field Securable (HS-FS), High-Security Enforced (HS-SE) or General Purpose (GP)\n- follows Combined or Legacy boot flow\n- contains system firmware (SYSFW) split into Texas Instruments Foundational Security (TIFS) and Device Manager (DM) or not split</p>\n<p>This leads to four similar yet unique <a href=\"https://u-boot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/board/ti/k3.html#boot-flow-variations\">boot flows</a>. Since the image must account for a combination of the three choices, packaging the boot-loader is a complex process that involves signing as well.</p>\n<p>This was earlier achieved using TI custom solution repositories, k3-image-gen and core-secdev-k3. k3-image-gen was responsible for generating and packaging board configuration data and system firmware binaries into tiboot3.bin or sysfw.itb while core-secdev-k3 was used for signing the required binaries in the case of HS devices. The flow looked like <a href=\"https://github.com/nehamalcom/migration-binman/blob/main/boot-flow-before-binman.drawio.png\">this</a>.</p>\n<p>The upstreaming effort proposed a flow that embedded the functionalities of k3-image-gen and core-secdev-k3 using Binman shown <a href=\"https://github.com/nehamalcom/migration-binman/blob/main/boot-flow-after-binman.drawio.png\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Now by migrating the boot-loader generation to Binman, complex shell scripts that stitched boot images together are no longer needed. Instead, the generation is standardized to creation using the binman node in the DTS, for example:\n<code>tiboot3 {\n    filename = \"tiboot3.bin\";\n    ti-secure-rom {\n        content = &lt;&amp;u_boot_spl&gt;, &lt;fw1&gt;, &lt;fw2&gt; ...;\n        keyfile = \"key.pem\";\n        load = &lt;LOAD_ADDR&gt;;\n        load-fw1 = &lt;LOAD_ADDR_FW1&gt;;\n        load-fw2 = &lt;LOAD_ADDR_FW2&gt;;\n        ...\n    };\n    u_boot_spl: u-boot-spl {\n    };\n    fw1: fw1 {\n        filename = fw1.bin;\n    };\n    fw2: fw2 {\n        filename = fw2.bin;\n    };\n    ...\n};</code>\nAn example of a proper application of the Binman node for K3 devices can be seen <a href=\"https://source.denx.de/u-boot/u-boot/-/blob/master/arch/arm/dts/k3-j721e-binman.dtsi\">here</a>. You can view the entire patch series that was submitted and has been accepted in the resources or <a href=\"https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/uboot/cover/20230721184446.5821-1-n-francis@ti.com/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>This presentation will provide an overview of the tool, understanding how to migrate your custom tools and platforms to Binman with K3 as an example and finally discuss current challenges and limitations while expanding to other platforms in U-Boot. Attendees will obtain insights into a practical implementation of Binman, its integration within existing workflows and best practices to leverage this tool to optimize U-Boot boot-loader development.</p>",

With TPM support in UKIs, systemd-stub and systemd-boot,\nthe systemd project is trying to do its part in bringing the ecosystem forward.</p>\n<p>But we need to talk about the kernel command line. Decades of [over|ab]use have\nmade it into a kitchen sink, used to do anything and everything, and (custom)\nparsed by everything and anything, including the kernel before ExitBootServices()\nhas been called. The surface attack that opens up for an authenticated writer is\nunfathomable, and the magnitude of a successful exploitation is simply unknowable.\nIs it time for the kernel command line to end?</p>\n<p>This talk will explore alternatives to let users configure early initrd/userspace\nservices provided by the systemd project, and plead with anybody willing to listen\nto start using those instead: UKIs, signed addons for UKIs, signed Confext/Sysext\nimages, systemd credentials, SMBIOS Type 11 strings, bootconfig.</p>",

Since the beginning, we have built our community on open principles in many aspects of our functioning. However, we have reached a point where we are running into the possible limits of this approach. In the past months, we have been looking for answers to (not only) the questions stated above, and I would like to share with you the insights from our journey.</p>",

Writing features and maintaining the project are expected, but a project needs more than good features to create a robust community around it. Open source organizational design is usually an after thought but it doesn’t have to be. Taking the time to define those “hats” early on can help a project grow and be sustainable enough to not rely on a few maintainers to do it all. In this session, Paris Pittman will share her experience helping maintainers avoid burnout, handle governance operations, increase adopters, and building plans for community. </p>\n<p>Is moderating your mailing list or chat platform something you want to do for the duration of the project as a lead maintainer? What about creating and writing all of the onboarding materials needed for contributors and users alike? In this session, we will draw from open source projects like Kubernetes, Swift, and others so that audience members will take away an action plan on building out intentional community roles, groups, and more so the many hats of maintainers are shared.</p>",

They both learned a lot of open source lessons along the way and are taking that knowledge into leadership and specific mentoring roles at IBM and AWS today.</p>\n<p>In this talk, Martin and Phil will provide guidance for both employees and technical leaders who are looking to invest in growing an open source culture where they work. We’ll help detail the ways that open source investment is valuable both for the company and for the employee’s own vitality and career advancement. We’ll share how our own open source journeys have unlocked career opportunities that may have been unavailable to us before, and how we are investing in others through various programs and career mentoring at our respective companies today.</p>",

First, a discussion of the strategies that can be employed to build healthy communities, including performing the work in the open and how good governance, contributor ladders, and roadmaps can help you grow diverse contributor communities. Second, how to take a strategic approach to metrics that help you align your unique goals, and  build healthy open source communities. Finally, the talk will include tips and techniques for interpreting what the metrics are telling you in ways that allow you to take action to continuously improve the health of your open source communities.</p>\n<p>This talk focuses on how to take a strategic approach to building FOSS communities and how the smart use of metrics can help you continuously measure your progress and improve community health.

    "abstract": "<p>Many who work in community management and development can see the process as a bit of an art form. Working with communities requires lots of soft skills of communicating with many different types of stakeholders, making decisions that represent lots of people, and managing relationships. On top of all of this, systematically growing a community can be difficult. In this talk, I will discuss how Open@RIT has utilized evidence based methodologies to work with open source projects to not only better facilitate maintenance of open source projects, but also to systematically determine what resources (both human and technical) are needed in order to grow and maintain open source communities. You can expect to hear about methods for funding and executing this type of work, attitudes and initiatives that we have found most helpful, and stories from our own experience to help you guide yours.</p>",

As blind software engineers, we believe we can bring a unique perspective to this essential endeavor.\nWe'll explore the challenges faced by blind users when using the Linux desktop environment, with a focus on constructive solutions. We will discuss two main topics: lack of preinstalled assistive technologies and accessibility problems of basic components of desktop environments. Our goal is to offer guidance and encouragement to developers, empowering them to create more inclusive experiences for all users.\nIn our vision for the ideal accessibility scenario, Linux distributions seamlessly accommodate the needs of blind users. To achieve this, we'll stress the importance of collaboration among developers and upstream projects, ensuring that accessibility becomes a fundamental consideration in the development process.\nAdditionally, we'll introduce the \"Linux Accessibility Guide\", a valuable resource that can assist developers in making graphical applications more accessible. This guide will offer practical insights and best practices to support their efforts.\nJoin us as we embark on a journey to improve the accessibility of Linux distributions, fostering an environment where accessibility is a shared goal, benefiting blind users and the entire Linux community. Together, we can create a more accessible and inclusive Linux desktop experience.</p>",

This talk will delve into the state of Enterprise Linux from Red Hat's perspective and share it in a community driven way.</p>\n<p>The upstream and downstream relationships that make up the RHEL supply chain contribute to what is arguably the largest and most sophisticated open source supply chain in the world. This large, sophisticated supply chain, and all of the Independent Software Developers (ISVs) involved, give RHEL a lot of gravity, probably more than any other open source product.</p>\n<p>For years, I think many of us in the open source world assumed that we knew everything there was to know about open source, but the truth is, we’re all still learning. In the last couple of years, there have been some big changes in the Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) supply chain, often referred to as Enterprise Linux or EL for short. This talk will try to share a representative opinion from Red Hat about where we see Enterprise Linux today, where we think it's going, and where we'd like to take it.</p>",

While it started as a <a href=\"https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/mkosi-initrd\">Fedora project</a> , mkosi-initrd has recently gained support for Ubuntu, Debian, OpenSUSE, CentOS, RHEL, Alma Linux, Rocky Linux and Arch Linux. We'll discuss the new distribution-independent implementation, what's implemented and what's still missing. We'll also give a brief introduction on <a href=\"https://github.com/systemd/mkosi\">mkosi</a> itself. </p>\n<p>We're hoping to start a discussion on what it would take for popular distributions to consider adopting this approach to building initrds and to leave FOSDEM with new ideas on how to improve the project.</p>",

So for not so tech-savvy users the major distributions need to pick up projects and package it, and maintain it for new releases.</p>\n<p>This is why there is a need for distribution-independent, secure, and easy-to-use packaging, like on smartphones. This exists also for Linux ... Among the options, there is <a href=\"https://snapcraft.io/about\"><strong>Snap</strong></a>! Applications are easy to find in the Snap Store and they are installable on most Linux distributions.</p>\n<p>And, to make Linux even easier for end users, we cannot only provide applications in the Snap format, but also have an <strong>all-Snap operating system, <a href=\"https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/ubuntu-core-desktop-deep-dive/\">Ubuntu Core Desktop</a></strong>, an <a href=\"https://ubuntu.com/blog/ubuntu-core-an-immutable-linux-desktop\">immutable core operating system</a> based on Snap. And here we do not only have Snaps of desktop applications, but also system applications and components (like the printing stack), the kernel, the desktop environment (like GNOME or KDE), the boot loader, and the core system. So everything can get easily updated or replaced by alternatives, and in case of failure one can easily revert (on boot failure we revert automatically).</p>\n<p>All this is based on the knowledge and experience we gained at Canonical when creating the smartphone operating system <a href=\"https://ubports.com/\">Ubuntu Touch</a>. After the phone project having been discontinued we started with the IoT system Ubuntu Core, snapped desktop applications, ...</p>\n<p>More about Snap: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iw4JA3m92Q8&amp;t=15854s\">The Powers</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ido6kGmSHWI\">The People</a></p>\n<p><strong>Want to learn snapping?

While it is extremely common for Linux distributions to compile for a baseline which encompasses all of an architecture, there was a lot of performance being left on the table by targeting such an old specification and not one of the newer revisions.</p>\n<p>Some distributions have opted to increase the baseline to x86-64-v2 or even -v3, but even there you are potentially leaving performance on the table while removing some of the older machines from being able to run on your distribution.  By targeting all of the psABI targets you don't remove the option of using old hardware while still providing optimized libraries for newer hardware, and you have happier users getting more out of their hardware.</p>",

Open? Yes, almost all the release cycle is public, anyone interested into building and releasing complex systems such as Linux based Operating System are invited to join.\nFlatcar is a Linux based OS designed to run container workloads: no package manager, /usr is read-only - it is the responsibility of the maintainers to keep the system up-to-date.\nFrom the definition of the content, to the payload release, passing by the \"go/no-go\" meeting let's see how Flatcar is defined, built and released and how the community is involved at each steps.</p>",

Since its initial launch in 2021, it has made a lot of progress and is now in alpha stage. The system can be deployed on a wide array of hardware and many people are using it as their desktop system; it works on x86_64, AArch64, POWER (little and big endian) as well as RISC-V and by now comes with thousands of packages.</p>\n<p>While trying to be practical, Chimera is also highly hardened, partly thanks to the LLVM toolchain, rendering it immune to various security issues other distros are vulnerable to. It has transparent and robust infrastructure, ensuring smooth deployment of packages. We are also developing various new tooling that the whole ecosystem can benefit from, including the Turnstile session tracker. Service management is based around Dinit, a modern, supervising system; we maintain and create a variety of tooling around it, trying to break the existing status quo with systemd, while abandoning legacy approaches.</p>\n<p>2023 has seen several major milestones, so I will focus on these, while also giving a short overview so that people unfamiliar with the system don't feel lost. I will also explain how our work benefits the entire Linux ecosystem, as well as beyond.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Distributed tracing can be very helpful when investigating production issues, especially in micro-services environments, where we have many small services running and it’s often difficult to pinpoint the cause/consequence relationship of failures or performance problems. OpenTelemetry already provides agents and SDKs that allows us to instrument our applications and generate distributed traces, however this talk focuses on approaches to generating distributed traces with eBPF by making zero code or configuration changes to the application stack.</p>\n<p>We’ll discuss approaches on tracking server/client context in web services with eBPF and how we can propagate this context in some programming languages/frameworks. We’ll also focus on the challenges and approaches to implementing context tracking and propagation with eBPF to protocols other than HTTP.</p>",

Join our journey redefining CI/CD observability, learn how you can start implementing the techniques we are using at Grafana Labs to ensure our pipelines are more reliable and stay performant over time, how to identify flakiness, and how we envision a future where - no matter your system or your observability solution - by implementing OpenTelemetry in our CI/CD processes. This way, stakeholders gain a profound understanding of our software delivery pipeline, enabling them to acquire actionable insights into system performance, identify bottlenecks, and make informed decisions for continuous improvement. This heightened level of observability empowers teams to proactively enhance the efficiency, reliability, and overall quality of the software delivery process, fostering a more streamlined and adaptive development lifecycle</p>",

You’ve been tasked with evolving the monitoring estate, and you know the right thing to do is lead them into an observability transformation. Now, where do you start?</p>\n<p>This talk explores how to introduce observability to large enterprises with a deep stack of technologies reaching right back to the early days of digitisation.

This presentation will offer an in-depth overview of the journey we've undertaken in building Netdata, highlighting the challenges we've faced and the innovative solutions we've developed to address them.</p>\n<p>In this presentation, we will delve into the history of Netdata, starting from its inception. We'll discuss the initial goals of creating a monitoring tool that could offer high-resolution metrics, auto-detection of metrics, and real-time visualization, all with minimal configuration required. We'll also explore how Netdata garnered rapid attention and support from the open-source community.</p>\n<p>The presentation will then shift focus to the evolution of Netdata, including the development of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a very efficient database engine (Netdata vs Prometheus: 35% less cpu utilization, 49% less memory, 12% less bandwidth, 98% less disk I/O, and 75% less size on disk for the same dataset),</li>\n<li>a powerful alerting engine that uses statistical analysis, machine learning and templates for fully automated alerts</li>\n<li>a streaming protocol supporting streaming of live data, replication of metrics, and support for routing interactive queries between Netdata agents</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Next, we'll discuss Netdata's transition into a distributed monitoring solution and the decision to seek funding to build a sustainable company around the open-source project. We'll emphasize the core concept of the Netdata SaaS model, which keeps monitoring features open-source while offering additional benefits like better integration, RBAC, and support through the SaaS platform.</p>\n<p>The presentation will showcase how Netdata's architecture allows for distributed monitoring, vertical and horizontal scalability, and real-time visibility across infrastructure. We'll discuss the challenges faced and overcome, such as the creation of a custom database engine, the streaming protocol as a fundamental element of the distributed nature of Netdata, the introduction of unsupervised anomaly detection, the implementation of distributed queries, the need for clarity and transparency during visualization and the user interface concepts we used to avoid providing a query editor to users.</p>\n<p>We'll also touch upon the challenges that remain, such as the use of WebRTC for browser-to-agent communication, the need to standardize metric naming conventions, the development of an expert system for metric interpretation, the support of infrastructure-level alerts in a distributed fashion and standardizing user experiences.</p>\n<p>By the end of this presentation, the audience will gain a deep understanding of Netdata's evolution, its unique features, and the challenges and solutions encountered along the way. They will also take away insights into building and maintaining large-scale open-source projects, as well as actionable ideas for improving their own monitoring and observability solutions.</p>",

Internally fully multi-threaded and asynchronous.\ntrx-control is a completely fresh approach at controlling transceivers.  It provides a rock-solid, multi-threaded, asynchronous framework to control different classes of hardware.  It supports transceivers that are able to send status updates on their own as well as transceivers that need polling.</p>\n<p>A main goal of the development was that adding drivers for new transceivers (or other types of hardware) is easy and can be done in an easy-to-learn, easy-to-understand scripting language, Lua in this case.</p>\n<p>This talk will - given the limited time available - describe the project without going too much into details.

The dual-channel coherent Software Defined Radio (SDR) receiver records the non-cooperative emitter signal as well as the signal received by a surveillance antenna facing the scene. Spatial diversity for azimuth mapping using direction of arrival measurement is achieved by moving the transmitter and receiver setup on a rail along a meter-long path -- the longer the better the azimuth resolution -- with quarter wavelength steps. The fully embedded application runs on a Raspberry Pi 4 single board computer executing GNU Radio on a Buildroot-generated GNU/Linux operating system.

This firmware can display a real-time waterfall at up to 61.44 Msps in a WebSDR-like interface using WebGL2 rendering, and record IQ data in SigMF format in the SDR DDR. The FPGA design is implemented in Amaranth, an Python-based HDL, and the software stack is implemented in Rust, targetting the embedded ARM CPU and WebAssembly.</p>\n<p>The first firmware version was released in February 2023, and the project was presented in June in the Software Defined Radio Academy.

The project is actively supporting an promoting the open source phylosophy in ham radio by implementing protocols like M17, a free and open source protocol for digital voice and data, and preferring open hardware devices when chosing new targets.

    "abstract": "<p>IQEngine is a free and open source web-based toolkit for analyzing, processing, and sharing RF recordings.  It is built on top of the FOSS SigMF metadata standard, and the canonical instance of the site running at www.iqengine.org acts as a central repository for example SigMF recordings, while being a valuable tool for signal analysis and RF/DSP education. Using IQEngine's plugin API, miscellaneous RF signal processing functions/apps can be triggered to run on the backend, with resulting IQ samples or other outputs such as signal detection/classification immediately visible on the IQEngine spectrogram interface.  Authors of these RF functions can add their function to www.iqengine.org as a plugin in order to share it with the world.  This talk will demo the current tool and discuss the concept of expanding IQEngine from being just a tool for users to preview RF recordings/datasets, into a way to preview RF functions/apps/software, including the current steps that have been completed towards this goal. </p>\n<p>https://github.com/iqengine/iqengine\nhttps://iqengine.org/</p>",

The Breakthrough Listen project has an updated pipeline for narrowband doppler drifting signals that learns from the last decade of data collection from the Green Bank Telescope, The Allen Telescope Array, Very Large Array, and Meerkat.</p>\n<p>This talk will give an overview of the new and improved narrowband doppler drifting search pipeline created for the Breakthrough Listen project which searches for signs of extraterrestrial intelligence using radio telescopes. The new pipeline called BLISS (Breakthrough Listen Interesting Signal Search) includes a new C++-based device-aware ndarray library called BLAND (Breakthrough Listen Arrays with N-Dimensions) heavily utilizing dlpack for easy interaction with a large ecosystem of neighboring scientific computing tools used in software radio such as numpy, cupy, matplotlib, pytorch, tensorflow. We will show how this library works with a quick overview of \"why ndarrays\" and build on top of that to work through the whole pipeline from 100m dish to detected signals.</p>\n<p>The current pipelines process hundreds of MHz of instantaneous bandwidth which is channelized in to various data products including down to channels of single-digit Hz. These fine channels are then used to search for narrowband doppler drifting signals. This search is sorting through the galactic haystack for needles which don't originate from earth. We'll highlight how we mitigate radio frequency interference, algorithmically search for signals with both single dish &amp; arrays, what's new &amp; corrected in the updated pipeline from historic SETI pipelines, and ways to join the SETI open source community.</p>\n<p>In addition to the focus of narrowband doppler drifting signal search with device-aware ndarrays that provide absurd ecosystem compatibility, we'll show off polyphase channelization and signal processing with ndarrays that demonstrate how BLAND can be used generally for software radio.</p>",

The ground segment of the SIDLOC system utilizes the existing SatNOGS network and the UHF band to perform the signal demodulation and identification. The SIDLOC system uses DSSS (Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum) PSK modulated signals with an effective bitrate of ~50 bits/s. Through an accurate Doppler frequency shift estimation mechanism, the SIDLOC system provides orbit determination capabilities, enabling open and independent SSA (Space Situational Awareness) activities.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>LINAGORA, as a leader in the Open LLM France community, has made it a priority to pull the curtain off of the process of building Large Language Models (LLMs). While most LLMs in use today – even the “open” ones – reveal few to no details about their training, and especially the data on which they are trained, we have decided to share it all. In this talk, we discuss why using an open model trained on traceable data is important for business and research alike and examine some of the difficulties involved in pursuing an open strategy for LLMs. We bring to the table our experience with data collection and training of LLMs, including the Claire family of language models.</p>\n<p>For links to the Claire models:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Main model: <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/OpenLLM-France/Claire-7B-0.1\">huggingface.co/OpenLLM-France/Claire-7B-0.1</a> (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0)</li>\n<li>Main model in GGUF formats: <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Claire-7B-0.1-GGUF\">huggingface.co/TheBloke/Claire-7B-0.1-GGUF</a></li>\n<li>Variant model, license Apache: <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/OpenLLM-France/Claire-7B-Apache-0.1\">huggingface.co/OpenLLM-France/Claire-7B-Apache-0.1</a></li>\n<li>Demo (simulated chat): <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/spaces/OpenLLM-France/Claire-Chat-0.1\">huggingface.co/spaces/OpenLLM-France/Claire-Chat-0.1</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Dataset &amp; Code:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Full dataset: <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/OpenLLM-France/Claire-Dialogue-French-0.1\">huggingface.co/datasets/OpenLLM-France/Claire-Dialogue-French-0.1</a></li>\n<li>Paper: <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16840\">arxiv.org/abs/2311.16840</a> “The Claire French Dialogue Dataset”; <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/papers/2311.16840\">https://huggingface.co/papers/2311.16840</a> (with links to related assets)</li>\n<li>Databases survey: <a href=\"https://github.com/OpenLLM-France/Claire-datasets\">https://github.com/OpenLLM-France/Claire-datasets</a></li>\n<li>Code for training: <a href=\"https://github.com/OpenLLM-France/Lit-Claire\">https://github.com/OpenLLM-France/Lit-Claire</a></li>\n</ul>",

    "abstract": "<p><a href=\"https://refine.rs/\">Check out our docs!</a></p>\n<p>In the evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, we're witnessing a significant shift in deep-learning design patterns, particularly with the advancement of foundational models. A key innovation in this area is the concept of 'adapters' –  small yet powerful add-ons that enhance an existing neural network with new capabilities without retraining its core layers.</p>\n<p>However, this innovation brings a hefty software engineering challenge, mainly when we discuss creating an open-source library encompassing a diverse range of these adapters. Neural networks, by their nature, are built using frameworks that procedurally encode their operations. Every time a new adapter is introduced, it often requires a substantial rewrite or rethinking of the existing code base.</p>\n<p>To address this challenge, we've developed 'Refiners' – a streamlined micro-framework built on top of PyTorch, one of the most popular machine learning frameworks. The goal of Refiners is to serve as a comprehensive collection of foundational models and their respective adapters. Its primary design pattern sets it apart: envisioning all neural networks as a 'Chain' of primary layers, neatly nested one after the other. Furthermore, we've integrated the 'Context API,' a feature that allows the implementation of complex models, including those that don't follow a simple linear structure.\nBy doing so, Refiners simplifies the integration of new adapters, making it easier for developers to build and enhance neural networks without the need to overhaul their entire code base each time. This approach saves time and opens up new possibilities for innovation in AI development.</p>",

AI is used in applications as diverse as fraud detection, medical detection, sales, security, and many more. AI adoption has more than doubled since 2017 and companies are now promoting an AI first strategy with their products and services. But if a developer wants to consume AI in their applications, do they need to be an AI expert? The simple answer is No!</p>\n<p>In this talk application developers will learn how they can treat AI the same as any other \"function\" where they give it input and it returns the expected output. This is made possible by open source AI frameworks that enable users to manage models through a set of developer friendly APIs. Discussion will revolve around open source frameworks like Ray, TGIS, Triton and TorchServe, to give an understanding of the tools available to help on the AI journey. There will be a demo of one of these runtimes in action by loading open source models from Hugging Face from different domains and querying the models through a web UI. </p>\n<p>There are great open source tools out there that provide an abstraction layer for application developers where they can consume AI models through APIs independent of understanding the data form of the model. Walking away from this talk, programmers will have a good appreciation of how they can practically consume AI in their applications without being an AI master.</p>",

For society an immanent danger is also in how easily they can be poisoned or lobotomized to propagate disinformation. It is also difficult to uncover and address sources of bias. The later is of particular legislative concern—see emerging regulations such as the EU’s AI Act as a prototype for whats to come. Without traceability for data with clear license expressions and provenance, AI models are easy targets. The open source community are particularly vulnerable and defenseless. Without a preemptive strategy legal risks are untenable.

    "abstract": "<p>Artificial intelligence is more accessible to developers, designers, and users than ever before. Machine learning functionality seamlessly woven into products and platforms makes our lives a little bit easier. A wealth of APIs, libraries, and tools make it trivial to tap into sophisticated models and methodologies that give our applications an intelligent edge.</p>\n<p>When thinking (or <em>\"thinking\"</em>) about open source and artificial intelligence, we see some significant challenges in retaining the open source ethos that has made open source software such a force for technological advancement. Join us in a Principled Component Analysis of artificial intelligence as we explore some key issues facing us in this new frontier of open source.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Ethical AI has emerged as a pivotal global discourse, reflecting the growing realization of its profound impact on societies worldwide. While social issues give rise to policy solutions and thus legislations, ethics are deeply rooted in societal values that differ greatly from one jurisdiction to another. In the last decade, diverse groups and individuals have departed from using exclusively Free Software licenses on their projects to developing new types of licensing solutions which prioritize “ethical” restrictions on how software should be further used and distributed. In this talk, I will delve into the ethical dimensions of the convergence of AI and Free Software, examining the challenges and opportunities in building responsible and ethical AI solutions within the free software ecosystem.</p>\n<p>This talk firstly provides examples of some of the most common licensing models imposing “ethical” restrictions. It then examines how licensing models imposing additional behavior restrictions that supposedly call themselves “open” are in contravention of the definitions of Free Software and Open Source Software. We will further explore some predominant material harms emanating from the use of these restrictive licenses. Lastly, given the various technical &amp; legal obstacles in using these restrictive licenses, I implore that the ethical compliance checks must fall within the purview of regulations and not software licenses.</p>\n<p>Given the proliferation of ethical licenses in AI landscapes causing additional behavior restrictions, integration of Free Software, license compatibility and licensing compliance become more complex, affecting the whole ecosystem. This presentation seeks to increase awareness about this crucial issue, particularly as public funds are being allocated to AI projects that may, at times, employ restrictive licensing practices.</p>",

However for a number of years it has taken an open approach to many of its standardization practices.  For example all the guides from the IoT Security Foundation (part of TechWorks) are release under a Creative Commons license. We will give a brief overview of this organization at the start of the talk.</p>\n<p>TechWorks identified that the shortage of AI engineers would represent a problem for the industry going forward.  However this is an industry with many, experienced software and hardware engineers.  The need therefore was for material to help those engineers transition to AI.</p>\n<p>The result, now 18 months into its development, is an open guide to best practice in AI and Machine Learning for experienced professional engineers (https://technes-uk.github.io/best-practice-guide/).  The source is maintained on GitHub and written in Sphinx, using a Creative Commons Attribution license (https://github.com/TechNES-UK/best-practice-guide).  This allows easy community contributions using pull-requests.</p>\n<p>We'll explore the challenges in developing this guide, and share plans for completing the initial release, and then maintaining it going forward.</p>",

This combination allows dynamic support of formats which aren’t natively supported by browsers.</p>\n<p>Our project delivers the script for integrating this new syntax in common HTML5 web pages, and additionally includes an SDK to generate new decode and playback filters and a visual studio code plugin that aids in determining the right combination of decoders for given file format. These tools leave enough room for inserting any combination of container, codec, or features in your websites to support legacy, current, or experimental media formats. This is suitable not only for novice website designers, but for professionals from the open-source community who want to ensure that content is easily accessible on all browsers.</p>",

We'll identify some common threads between all of this work and end with some principles that we can all follow to join the Conspiracy to Solve Video for Everybody Forever.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>I used to edit my own podcast with COTS DAW software. Regularly, 1 hour of footage takes 6 hours' editing just to remove space, filling words, mumbles.</p>\n<p>After that, I am exhausted and couldn't do any creative arrangement.</p>\n<p>It's nearly impossible to select quotes from different speaker in different time and combine into 1 package as a independent creator in spear time, without a team.</p>\n<p>I'll share my effort to take back control of video creating, editing, and note-taking, with or without Vim. </p>\n<p>During the last two years, I wrote myself a series of handy scripts. It works with or without Vim. I cut my podcast with it, and translated podcasts into captioned videos. It's highly efficient.</p>\n<p>Yes, there are commercial products like Descript, Adobe Podcast, AVID Media Composer on the market. But it's not open nor free.</p>\n<p>Basically I defined a file format. It's basically a spreadsheet in plain text, tsv. It can be converted to and back from srt subtitle.  After that, you can remove it, shuffle it, combine it or repeat it.</p>\n<pre>\nEDL 00:00:03,123 00:01:03,500 | clipname | subtitles, maybe description with AI \n</pre>\n\n<p>To prove the simplicity, one can convert srt to tsv in a single line of bash:</p>\n<pre>\ncat some.srt | sed -n -r '1{/^$/n;};/^[0-9]+$/{n; s/ --> /\\t/; s/$/\\t| _CLIPNAME_ |\\t/; N; s/\\n//; h; d;}; /^$/! { H; $!d;}; x; s/\\n/\\\\N/g; s/^/EDL\\t/;p' > some.tsv\n</pre>\n\n<p>EDL stands for 'editorial decision list'. Those three letters are very useful with 'grep'. Yes. You can grep it! For example, the following line invokes ffmpeg and generates a video.</p>\n<pre>\ncat recording_1990.tsv recording_2023.tsv | grep -c 3 Linux | tsv2roughcut\n</pre>\n\n<p>Each line without 'EDL' in the beginning, will be ignored. So you get comments now. The clipname can be audio, video or still picture.</p>\n<p>You may also pipe it into tsv2fcpxml, and import into professional editing software for fine-tuning, or delegate to professional editors. So you don't have to work late side by side with them.</p>\n<p>You may even add B-roll at the head of the subtitle, to create a BBC style voice over video. </p>\n<p>Furthermore, with this plugin in Vim, you can preview video/audio with mpv player, cut/join lines, add comments and fold/unfold with Markdown/Org mode style headers.</p>\n<p>(This methodology originated from BBC is called 'Paper edit'. It's battlefield proven since 1970s and can be very efficient in news-making or news-faking.)</p>\n<p>Try it.

    "abstract": "<p>Many programs use poll/select system calls to wait for events that are triggered by file descriptor I/O events.\nFor instance, to write a library able to behave like a network stack (e.g. lwip and picoTCP) or a device, it's possible to implement functions like my_socket, my_accept, my_open and my_ioctl, as drop-in replacement of the system call counterparts.\nAdditionally, it's possible to use dynamic library magic to rename/divert the system call requests to use their virtual implementation provided by the library.\nUnfortunately this approach cannot be applied to poll/select system calls because Linux doesn't have a system call that permits to generate synthetic generic events for a file descriptor, so it is not possible for libraries to provide file descriptors suitable for select/poll system calls.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/rd235/libvpoll-eventfd\">libvpoll</a> permits to define file descriptors whose I/O events can be generated at user level.\nThis permits to generate synthetic events for poll, select, ppoll, pselect, epoll, etc.\nThe libvpoll library can use two different supports: a module that provides a virtual device and a kernel patch extending the eventfd system call.\nWhen neither are availables, a feature-limited emulation is provided as a fallback: based on pipe it manages only POLLIN and POLLOUT.\nThis approach allows mixing real file descriptors with others provided by libraries as parameters of poll/select system calls.\nFor example libvpoll has been used in <a href=\"https://github.com/virtualsquare/picoxnet\">picoxnet</a>, a user-level network stack implemented as a library for the <a href=\"https://wiki.virtualsquare.org/#/tutorials/ioth\">Internet of Threads</a>.\nlibvpoll, as well as the kernel device module, are already available in Debian.</p>",

For TPM2 (the standard TPM nowadays) it is used for IMA (PCR extensions), Periodic random number seeding and Trusted Keys (effectively TPM sealed data which may be piped securely to userspace because it can only be unwrapped by the kernel).  The big upcoming change is adding encryption and HMAC security to all TPM transactions because of the threats from Interposers (hardware corrupted to snoop the TPM bus).  This will be completely transparent to users, but infrastructure can be added to detect interposer compromises.  This talk will outline how this works and the null seed scheme for detecting interposers.</p>\n<p>TPM keys (really TPM sealed data) have been around for a long time and can be used for things like storing the symmetric key for LUKS based dm-crypt.  A recent innovation for the kernel was to adopt the standardised form for ASN.1 keys (so other tools can seal and unseal them) and the latest innovation will be to add TPM policy (including signed policies) to kernel keys.  This talk will detail what TPM policy is, how it works and how it can be used by the kernel.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Did you know that Linux has a full-featured keystore ready to be used by any application or service it runs? Applications can securely store and share credentials, secrets and cryptographic keys, sign and encrypt data, negotiate a common encryption key - all this by never touching a single byte of the underlying cryptographic material.</p>\n<p>This is especially useful in the post-heartbleed and cloud-native environments, where services authenticate and securely talk to each other using some kind of credentials. But if a network-facing service also has some secret in its process address space, it sets itself up for a security failure as any potential out-of-bounds memory access vulnerability may allow the secret to be leaked. Imagine a world where you don’t have to run an SSH agent just to protect your SSH keys.</p>\n<p>On top of keeping your secrets secret Linux keystore nicely integrates with specialized security hardware, like TPMs and HSMs and may provide a single entry point on the system for applications to obtain their secrets. Thus Linux keystore is a very useful building block for a corporate key management system.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>One of the tasks at the device forensics team of the Netherlands Forensic Institute is the reverse engineering of soft- and hardware devices for the judicial system. This task spans a lot of different abstractions in the IT ecosystem, from network protocols, to filesystems, encryption algorithms etc. One very active topic of research is the reverse engineering of low level firmware. This topic proves to be quite a bit more difficult than a lot of others on the list.</p>\n<p>One of the big challenges in the reverse engineering of low-level firmware is the lack of hardware abstractions and known interfaces (e.g. syscall interfaces and libraries with known exported functions). Furthermore, this type of firmware is oftentimes found in on-die ROM, which provides a good incentive to keep it's size small, as this type of memory can be expensive. This usually means there is not a lot of space for (debug) strings either. </p>\n<p>These factors making static reverse engineering quite a tough challenge, which in turn makes dynamic reversing more attractive. However, this is not an easy task. The lack of hardware abstractions and the presence of memory-mapped peripherals makes emulation no small feat. Outside of some OSINT and cross-referencing, the best one can do is guess at the working of some of these unknown peripherals. But is there a smarter way of guessing? </p>\n<p>In this talk, we present <a href=\"https://github.com/NetherlandsForensicInstitute/CONFEDSS\">CONFEDSS</a>, a project for <strong>C</strong>oncolic <strong>F</strong>irmware <strong>E</strong>mulation using <strong>D</strong>ynamic <strong>S</strong>tate <strong>S</strong>election. This project aims to make it easier for reverse engineers to dynamically reverse low-level firmware by emulating it and using dynamic state selection as an approach to peripheral simulation. We will give a detailed insight into the problems usually encountered with low-level emulation and show it's workings with a live demo, which will hopefully inspire you to use it the next time you want to emulate some BIOS logic for exotic hardware or find where that weird driver quirk comes from.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Arm64EC (\"Emulation Compatible\") is Microsoft's latest answer to emulating x86_64 on arm64, allowing code from both architectures to coexist in a single address space, so that an application can be <em>incrementally</em> ported from x86_64 to arm64. I'll cover what Arm64EC is, postulate on why it is the way it is, and lessons learnt from porting LuaJIT to it.\nWhat if there was a CPU (and associated C toolchain) capable of executing both x86_64 and arm64 instructions, cheaply switching back and forth at any function call boundary? While there isn't such a thing, Arm64EC emulates such a CPU - any x86_64 code is emulated, and any arm64 code needs to contort itself slightly to allow cheap switching in to and out of the emulator. The result is something of an emulation Frankenstein, but <em>just maybe</em> it'll help adoption of Windows on arm64.</p>\n<p>Speaking about a Windows feature at an open source event might seem initially odd, but things can be intellectually interesting regardless of origin, and open source tooling such as Wine and LLVM have started to add some support for it, and open source developers might want to port their applications to it (as I have done for LuaJIT).</p>\n<p>Related resources:\n* <a href=\"https://github.com/LuaJIT/LuaJIT/issues/1096\">Out of tree LuaJIT support for Arm64EC</a>\n* <a href=\"https://www.corsix.org/content/windows-arm64ec-notes\">My Arm64EC ABI notes</a></p>\n<p>Note that I have no association with Microsoft or with ARM.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>The invention of the integrated circuit in the late 1950's led to first 4 bits generation of microprocessors/controllers in the early 70's. While the Intel 4004 was the first commercial microprocessor, the TMS 1000 for Texas Instruments was the first widely available microcontroller embedding CPU, RAM and ROM for a mere 2$. Millions of units of this family were deployed in many calculators and handheld games. This talk will have a retrospective look at this piece of history based on an Harvard architecture. We will first analyse the die, especially how to visually decode its rom content and disassemble it. Then we will have a look at its instruction set and look at the coding of some basic operations found in early calculators, including \"reversed\" calculators such as the famous little professor and other handheld games of this time. We will show this in action using the Mame emulator and have a look at how Mame handles the TMS 1000 (including some specific display or input controls, e.g. Merlin). Last but not last, you will discover and be able to play with our Big Professor A3 version based on an Arduino Nano, LED matrix and 3D printing !</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>In 1983, Commodore introduced CBM-II, the successor to their aging line of PET business computers. It featured a 6502 CPU running at 2 MHz and up to 256 kB memory. But its most interesting feature was a second CPU interface, which (much like Acorn's Tube) allowed to attach various CPUs to the system.</p>\n<p>Commodore designed two cards: Z80 (for running CP/M) and 8088 (for running MS-DOS). Back in these days, though, MS-DOS had a separate version for each platform. Therefore you could only run specially crafted Commodore MS-DOS 1.25 on the computer, because it was obviously not PC-compatible.</p>\n<p>A few years ago I set out to fix this deficiency. I asked myself: is it possible to make the platform (more) PC compatible? As it turns out, it is, and practically without any modifications to the original design. You just need to write a piece of software that emulates the PC BIOS and some parts of the PC hardware platform. For this, one wire needs to be added to the hardware, which generates a NMI when an I/O chip is accessed; the emulation software then simulates the non-existing I/O peripheral.</p>\n<p>Based on this work, I was able to make the platform compatible enough to run modern FreeDOS, as well as other PC software: Norton Commander, Turbo Pascal, QBASIC and more.</p>\n<p>As a follow-up, I designed a Z8000 processor card using the second CPU interface; this card is meant to emulate the abandoned Commodore 900 Unix workstation. This is a work in progress right now; so far the card is able to boot the Commodore 900 BIOS and complete the I/O chip self test (the I/O chips are obviously also emulated in software). By the time of the talk, the progress is expected to be much farther :)</p>\n<p>The PC emulation software is available on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/MichalPleban/cbm2-pc-emulator/</p>\n<p>And the hardware:\nhttps://github.com/MichalPleban/cbm2-8088-ram-board/</p>",

On top of this it has access to modern interfaces like I2C and SPI which allow it to interface modern sensors, displays and other devices unleashing the Arduino like applications.</p>\n<p>With such flexibility was just matter of time to recreate all retro computers based on 6502 like Apple ][+, Apple IIe, Oric Atmos which are already done. \nCommodore64 and BBC Micro are in the TODO list.\nWhat makes more fun is that you dont have to just copy what was done, but you can make your own unique arhchitecture as well, with the flexibility Neo6502 presents you can make your own dream 6502 computer.\nThe Neo6502 repository: https://github.com/OLIMEX/Neo6502\nThe Neo6502 Apple][+ Apple][e OricAtmos repository: https://github.com/vsladkov/reload-emulator\nThe Neo6502 original firmware from Paul Robson https://github.com/paulscottrobson/neo6502-firmware/\nThe Neo6502 BBC/EHBasic firmware from Rien Matthijsse https://github.com/marobi/Pico_6502_v4\nThe Neo6502 environment by Oliver Schmidt https://github.com/oliverschmidt/neo6502-firmware</p>",

Although the default isolation level in most databases is usually adequate, it is important to know and use it correctly in your application. This technical session explores the implementation of these concepts in popular SQL databases such as Oracle, MySQL, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, and YugabyteDB. We will also examine why traditional SQL standard definitions may not be suitable for MVCC databases and why this knowledge is essential for developers. By the end of the session, you will be able to navigate these subtleties with ease and make informed decisions in your application design without getting too academic.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Security is an essential, yet often misunderstood, part of effectively managing a PostgreSQL cluster. As the popularity and adoption of PostgreSQL continues to grow, the interaction of roles, privileges, and object ownership is a recurring theme of confusion in forums and mailing lists.</p>\n<p>In this session, I’ll start by defining the Principle of Least Privileges and how this philosophy influences roles and privileges in PostgreSQL. Next, I’ll demonstrate the importance of object ownership in PostgreSQL, how group and user roles can work in unison to effectively manage permissions, multiple ways to manage default privileges, and which privileges should always be modified in any new PostgreSQL database. Finally, I’ll discuss how recent releases are laying a foundation for more flexible and robust security management in the years ahead.</p>\n<p>By the end of this session, you will understand how roles work in PostgreSQL, how they impact your daily work, and how to effectively communicate security best practices with others on your team. You’ll leave with a solid information to start creating roles that effectively manage access to your cluster and data.</p>",

The question is - are there significant performance differences between these filesystems for Postgres? Are there clear winners or filesystems you definitely should not use? I did a similar comparison a couple years back, but both the Postgres and kernel are continuously improving and adopting to new hardware, so let's look at fresh data.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>This talk focuses on the synergistic combination of CrateDB (https://github.com/crate/crate) and LangChain (https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain): it helps to get started with using private data as context for large language models through LangChain, incorporating the concept of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). CrateDB as an open-source distributed SQL database helps to streamline data management by supporting a wide variety of data models ranging from documents over time series and full-text search towards recently added support for vectors and similarity search. Thus, it helps to avoid technology sprawl in modern data architectures that need to cope with structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data while not sacrificing the convenience of having a standard SQL interface. LangChain, an open-source framework written in Python, is specifically designed to facilitate the development of applications using large language models (LLMs). LangChain enables seamless integration of language models with various data sources and services, acting as a bridge between AI language capabilities and private data.</p>\n<p>During the talk we will demonstrate CrateDB's proficiency in storing and handling vector data, and how this can be utilized by large language models (LLMs) through LangChain, further enhanced by RAG for richer contextual insights. Through live coding demonstration, we will illustrate firsthand the process of extracting data from CrateDB and integrating it into LLMs using LangChain, thereby enriching language models with new data. This integration finds practical applications in semantic search, content recommendation, and data analytics, just to name a few.</p>\n<p>The talk will appeal to anyone keen on leveraging Large Language Models, enhanced by Retrieval Augmented Generation, to unlock new insights from their private data. Participants will also learn how to leverage the CrateDB database to efficiently store vector data and utilize vector search in advanced analytics applications.</p>",

Unlike most of other probability toolkits, it is open to different probability representations, including fractions and symbols (using the <a href=\"https://www.sympy.org\">SymPy library</a>). These features make Lea ideal for education, to learn the theory of probability, from basics to advanced concepts.</p>\n<p>The talk will present classical or non-classical problems in probability, and how these can be solved easily using Python and Lea. These include games (dice roll, RPG combats, etc.) and funny paradoxes (non-transitive dice, boy or girl paradox, etc.). The “murder party” case will demonstrate how uncertain information can help to find out the most probable perpetrator of a murder. These examples will switch between probabilities as float numbers, fractions and symbols, i.e. returning formulas instead of numbers—and demonstrating practically Python’s “duck typing” at work.</p>\n<p>The talk will conclude with a revival of the <a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/piedenis/lea/wiki/Lea3_Examples#markdown-header-bullshit-generator\">“bullshit generator”</a>, a 15 years-old, non-serious precursor of ChatGPT (300 lines script, including data)!</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>The AlekSIS® project, a free and open school information system helping with digitisation of school organisation, originally had a frontend based on the server rendered Django template engine as a reliable and easy solution. As our frontends got more complex and we had to built interactive components like a timetable builder, we ran into limits of this system. In addition to that, the UI framework we had been using got out of support. So we decided to develop a completely new frontend as a single page application based on Vue.js and the UI framework Vuetify, connecting to the Django backend using a GraphQL API.</p>\n<p>But because of our large, modular ecosystem with many different apps, we knew we never would be able to migrate everything to the new frontend within one release. Therefore, the team faced the challenge to integrate pages with the old frontend together with new pages in the new single page application. The core of this system is an abstraction layer that allows daisy chaining the Vuetify views with server-rendered pages, including sugar that lets legacy Django pages communicate with the client-side UI framework.</p>\n<p>We would like to share our experiences about this complex migration and what problems to expect and how we solved them.</p>\n<p>(Allergen declaration: May contain traces of JavaScript.)</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Flakes aka tests that don’t behave deterministically, i.e. they fail sometimes and pass sometimes, are an ever recurring problem in software development. This is especially the sad reality when running e2e tests where a lot of components are involved. There are various reasons why a test can be flaky, however the impact can be as fatal as CI being loaded beyond capacity causing overly long feedback cycles or even users losing trust in CI itself.</p>\n<p>For the <a href=\"https://kubevirt.io/\">KubeVirt</a> project we want to remove flakes as fast as possible to minimize the number of retests required. This leads to shorter time to merge, reduces CI user frustration, improves trust in CI, while at the same time it decreases the overall load for the CI system.</p>\n<p>We start by generating a report of tests that have failed at least once inside a merged PR, meaning that in the end all tests have succeeded, thus flaky tests have been run inside CI. We then look at the report to separate flakes from real issues and forward the flakes to dev teams.</p>\n<p>As a result retest numbers have gone down significantly over the last year.</p>\n<p>After attending the session the user will have an idea of what our flake process is, how we exercise it and what the actual outcomes are.</p>",

As an open-source project, we can make good use of free runner time on platforms like GitHub. But I guess there's no such thing as a free-lunch because those runners lack the performance we need to run our test suite. This is why in 2023 we decided to dog-food Kairos and used it to build our infra as code.

The focus is on demonstrating practical, hands-on applications of chaos experiments to underline how they can enhance the resilience and reliability of Kafka clusters managed by Strimzi in a Kubernetes environment.</p>\n<p>The presentation begins by introducing the fundamental principles of chaos engineering, establishing a foundation for the subsequent demonstrations. The core of the session features a series of detailed demonstrations, each focusing on a specific chaos experiment. These experiments and their effects on the Strimzi-managed Kafka clusters are carefully observed and analyzed, utilizing tools such as <a href=\"https://grafana.com/\">Grafana</a> and <a href=\"https://prometheus.io/\">Prometheus</a> from the CNCF projects. Through these demonstrations, attendees will gain a clear understanding of various tools and techniques used to create and manage failure scenarios. This part of the session is designed to provide a vivid insight into how different types of disruptions can impact system stability and performance, emphasizing the practical aspects of chaos engineering in a real-world environment.</p>\n<p>Throughout the session, we will discuss and demonstrate:\n- Setting Up the Environment: Preparation of a Strimzi-managed Kafka cluster on Kubernetes for chaos experiments.\n- Designing Chaos Experiments: Crafting realistic and meaningful chaos scenarios tailored to Kafka clusters.\n- Implementing Experiments: Step-by-step execution of chaos experiments, including network failures, pod deletions, and resource constraints.\n- Monitoring and Analysis: Utilizing monitoring tools to observe the impact of chaos experiments and analyze system behavior under stress. Using Prometheus and Grafana.\n- Learning and Adapting: Interpreting results to improve system design and resilience strategies.</p>",

Feature flags and Canary deployments are some of the techniques in Progressive Delivery, used to roll out new versions gradually.</p>\n<p>For containerized workloads running on <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io/\">Kubernetes</a> it is very easy to adopt Progressive Delivery using <a href=\"https://argo-rollouts.readthedocs.io/\">Argo Rollouts</a>. At Adobe Experience Manager we are deploying over 10k non Adobe customer services to Kubernetes. New deployments can occur multiple times per day from internal changes or from customer code, which can be very different from one customer to another. A new feature or piece of code can work fine for 99% of customers but still affect the other 1%, and being able to detect this from just tests is a very costly process. </p>\n<p>We will show how to implement a Progressive Delivery pipeline with Argo Rollouts to improve the reliability of the service and prevent regressions. It allows the protection of the service and automation of roll backs to a previous version if needed. This allows for faster delivery with more confidence so regressions are less likely to affect a customer.</p>",

    "abstract": "<p>Having a good CI is a must-have for any serious software project nowadays.</p>\n<p>Modern CI platforms and tools make it trivial to build an initial CI configuration and have it plugged in the development workflow.\nThey however don't solve the ongoing maintenance cost, as any CI system requires maintaining a specific logic for creating a suitable build environment on the CI runners, meaning that every change to the build requirements will have to be duplicated in the CI setup. And that duplication means that the different setups will inevitably drift out of sync, leading to head-banging errors that will only happen in one setup but not another.</p>\n<p>This talk is about leveraging Nix to be able to declare an environment that can be used both locally, and on any CI service, so that the maintenance cost becomes minimal, and the environments are guaranteed to stay in sync.</p>",

You can test the program's functions, of course, but what about making sure the whole thing works, with command line arguments, flags, and options?\nWe can build the program and run shell scripts, but that process is cumbersome, not integrated, and easy to let errors slip by.\nEnters <code>go-internal/testscript</code>, a testing library that was designed to test the go tool itself. With it, we can test our command-line applications without leaving the 'go test' framework.\nThe <code>testscript</code> environment already offers built-in commands and conditions to test our application in many ways. For the advanced user, moreover, there is the possibility of creating custom commands and checks that make the test fit our development needs properly.\nAttendees of this talk will learn:\n* how to start with <code>testscript</code>, by testing any command-line application, whether it is produced by your project or not;\n* how to integrate <code>testscript</code> into your project, and test the resulting binary within the test environment, without any additional steps;\n* how to customise <code>testscript</code> runs using custom commands and conditions.</p>",

Github's Dependabot, Renovate, and similar services automatically create a new branch with the latest version of a library dependency and then execute project tests to detect any breaking changes. While such services are gaining a lot of traction, no study looks into whether test suites of average GitHub Projects have sufficient coverage and are adequate to detect incompatible library changes.</p>\n<p>To better understand the state of test coverage and effectiveness of project test suites for detecting incompatible library changes in open-source projects, I will, in this talk, present a study comprising 262 Java projects on GitHub. By artificially injecting faulty changes in library dependencies, we identify that test suites, on average, have coverage of 58% of their direct and 20% of their transitive dependencies. The average test suite effectively detects 47% of faulty updates in direct dependencies and 35% in transitive dependencies. Based on our findings, I will explain recommendations for developers and toolmakers that could improve the reliability and expectations of automated dependency updating.</p>",
