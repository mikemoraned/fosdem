                    This is a small website where you can find events in
                    <a href="https://fosdem.org/2024/">FOSDEM 2024</a> based on content search.

                    <a href="https://www.houseofmoran.com">I</a> wrote this because, whilst
                    I really enjoy attending FOSDEM, the amount of possible things to see is large,
                    and there is always a chance I can miss something.

                    The <a href="https://fosdem.org/2024/">main website</a> does have search, so, 
                    <em>to be totally honest</em> I should also say I just wanted to play about with 
                    OpenAI Embeddings.

                    See <a href="https://github.com/mikemoraned/fosdem">Github</a> for how this was built.
