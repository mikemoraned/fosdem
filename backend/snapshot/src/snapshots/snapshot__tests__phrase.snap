    abstract: "<p>Much of the existing research about open source elects to study software repositories instead of ecosystems. An open source repository most often refers to the artifacts recorded in a version control system and occasionally includes interactions around the repository itself. An open source ecosystem refers to a collection of repositories, the community, their interactions, incentives, behavioral norms, and culture. The decentralized nature of open source makes holistic analysis of the ecosystem an arduous task, with communities and identities intersecting in organic and evolving ways. Despite these complexities, the increased scrutiny on software security and supply chains makes it of the utmost importance to take an ecosystem-based approach when performing research about open source. This talk provides guidelines and best practices for research using data collected from open source ecosystems, encouraging research teams to work with communities in respectful ways.</p>"

        abstract: "<p>Scripts and softwares are indispensable components of contemporary research. While the study of scientific instruments has been extensively covered in science and technology studies (STS), as well as aspects related to digital data, software strangely remains absent. I will build on the success of Jupyter computational notebooks to sketch a social study of open source scientific softwares. </p>\n<p>The Jupyter project, initiated in 2001 by a physics graduate student interested in scientific programming, has gradually evolved into a global data science infrastructure. I will demonstrate the importance of closely examining its trajectory by identifying the continually negotiated conditions for the transition from local usage to a role as a generic instrument, progressively leading to its integration into a diversity of services beyond scientific communities. The dissemination of computational notebooks has thus not only facilitated a convergence between open code and open science but also between the practices of researchers and those of computer developers, leading to the stabilization of a specific infrastructure for data analysis.</p>"

An open source ecosystem refers to a collection of repositories, the community, their interactions, incentives, behavioral norms, and culture. The decentralized nature of open source makes holistic analysis of the ecosystem an arduous task, with communities and identities intersecting in organic and evolving ways. Despite these complexities, the increased scrutiny on software security and supply chains makes it of the utmost importance to take an ecosystem-based approach when performing research about open source. This talk provides guidelines and best practices for research using data collected from open source ecosystems, encouraging research teams to work with communities in respectful ways.</p>"

        abstract: "<p>This talk delves into the evolution of Ubuntu Touch on PINE64 devices since its release in 2020. Over the past several years there have been significant changes, both to the development team and the codebase.  </p>\n<p>The shifts in the UBPorts/PINE64 community stem from the original PinePhone port’s maintainer moving on from the project, which coincided with the release of the PinePhone Pro. This left the community at a crossroads: necessitating the search for a new maintainer and the development of a new port.  </p>\n<p>A key milestone in this journey was the showcasing of an early-stage community port for the PinePhone Pro running on Ubuntu Touch 20.04 at FOSDEM last year. Since then, a new maintainer has achieved remarkable improvements, including porting 20.04 to the original PinePhone and PineTab, as well as the newly released PineTab2.  </p>\n<p>This presentation will explore the challenges encountered in integrating new devices, updating existing ones, and the process of harmonizing mainline Linux with Ubuntu Touch. This is particularly crucial as Ubuntu Touch has historically leaned towards devices designed for Android/Halium-based devices, somewhat sidelining mainline Linux in the transition to 20.04. Furthermore, the discussion will extend to the future prospects of this port and its implications for Lomiri on mainline Linux across different distributions.</p>"

    abstract: "<p>Progressively, there are more and more risks associated with computer intelligence, and as a transparent software company we have the responsibility to intervene and protect our users. Recently, Microsoft laid off its entire ethics and society team, the team that taught employees how to make AI tools responsibly. Nextcloud on the other hand, embraces the ethics and challenges that make up today’s AI and aims to take them head on.</p>\n<p>The field of AI is moving fast, and many of the new capabilities face ethical and even legal challenges.</p>\n<p>For example, there are problems with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Privacy and security of user data</li>\n<li>Discrimination and biases</li>\n<li>Energy usage</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In particular with neural networks based AI technologies, the mere availability of open source code is no longer enough to be able to say you are in control over your data or that the software is safe or ethical. The set of data and the software used in the training, as well as the availability of the final model are all factors that determine the amount of freedom and control a user has.</p>\n<p>Until Hub 3, we succeeded in offering features like related resources, recommended files, our priority inbox and even face and object recognition without reliance on proprietary blobs or third party servers.</p>\n<p>Yet, while there is a large community developing ethical, safe and privacy-respecting technologies, there are many other relevant technologies users might want to use. We want to provide users these cutting-edge technologies – but also be transparent. For some use cases, ChatGPT might be a reasonable solution, while for other data, it is paramount to have a local, on-prem, open solution. To differentiate these, we developed an Ethical AI Rating.</p>\n<p>Our Ethical AI Rating is designed to give a quick insight into the ethical implications of a particular integration of AI in Nextcloud. We of course still encourage users to look more deeply into the specific solution they use, but hope that this way we simplify the choice for the majority of our users and customers.</p>\n<p>I will describe how our Ethical AI rating works, and give a bunch of examples. And, as a bonus, show how it is integrated in Nextcloud and how it can help you get work done - without leaking your data!</p>\n<p>I look forward to any feedback you wonderful folks in the audience have.</p>"

We plan to interact heavily with the audience so that the open source community gets represented in AI governance. \nThe panel experts will be Alexandra Tsalidis from the Future of Life Institute's Policy team and Felicity Redel on the foresight team at ICFG. \nStefania Delprete, data scientist with extensive experience with the opensource community (Python and Mozilla), will be moderating the session. </p>\n<p>Key points of the presentation\n- Current vulnerabilities you expose yourself to using AI models (low robustness, hallucinations, trojans, ..)  <br />\n- Open weights of AI models doesn't bring the guarantees of open source (you can't read the code, debug, modify precisely)<br />\n- Steps to reduce user (developers) risk (model cards, open datasets)<br />\n- Steps to reduce misuse risk (capability evaluations, scoped applications, responsible release)<br />\nExpert panel debate questions:<br />\n- What are downside risks of unrestricted open source AI proliferation?<br />\n- What would a governance of open source AI models that leads to good outcomes look like? <br />\n- How can the open source community contribute to AI Safety?</p>"

        abstract: "<p>Generative AI in 2024 has a consent problem. Scraped and otherwise stolen datasets are used to produce output that can directly compete with the people who generated the source data. This doesn’t have to be our future. The Common Voice project collects volunteer donated speech data to freely offer academics, industry and language activists a future where meaningful linguistic diversity is built into the digital products and services that increasingly fill our world. By teaching computers the way that real people speak, Common Voice doesn’t just offer a better connected future for global users, but presents us with one possible consent led model for community driven data collection. Together, let’s explore how community led dataset collection, design and governance structures have developed across speech datasets and look at how freely donated data, data trusts and other consent led collection models could offer a less dystopian AI future.\nAn exploratory look at the proliferation of consent led data collection models in speech datasets, looking not only at Common Voice's CC0 donation-led approach but also looking into how data collection and governance models that offer more granular data control (like language community led data trusts) could offer AI and all of us touched by AI a less dystopian path into the future.</p>"

The Open Source Initiative is inviting developers of AI and users to find the principles of Open Source applied to AI systems. </p>\n<p>Finding an agreement on what constitutes Open Source AI is the most important challenge facing the free software (also known as open source) movement. European regulation already started referring to \"free and open source AI\", large economic actors like Meta are calling their systems \"open source\" despite the fact that their license contain restrictions on fields-of-use (among other things) and the landscape is evolving so quickly that if we don't keep up, we'll be irrelevant.</p>\n<p>The session will have a short introduction to the project, which started mid-2023, followed by a summary of the most current draft of the Definition. The bulk of the session will be an assignment for the audience: to review the draft Definition and provide comments. The responses will be used as feedback to release a new draft.</p>"

    abstract: "<p>The behaviour of repos over time will be examined from the perspective of semantic graphs and qualifying annotations.\nThe focus will not only be concerning direct diffs within a specific commit but emphasizing greater contextualization of what was taking place.\nFor example, understanding the relationship of a commit in the context of a project's sections; functionality; or symbiotic repos.</p>\n<p>Through the use of logic programming (SWI-Prolog) and the useful of (RDF) principles, demonstrations will include:\n* How historic changes to files in a VCS should not be treated as logs of affect but additionally as components for adapting other coding and knowledge assets;\n* How failure to preemptively describe the desired outcomes from a successful commit mean that there is a failure to provide preparatory automation behaviours.</p>\n<p>The aforementioned logic programming and RDF expositions will demonstrate the evolution of the (historically NLNet funded) project Icebreaker.\nIt shall be mixing its parsing syntaxes from seperate projects (kanban boards and knowledge-management with syntaxes for time series analyses of repos).\nThere will be a showing of how task management; documentation; and coding intersect using perspectives from how annotations from the \"Recursive-Modelling-Language\" Qiuy intersect over time.</p>\n<p>Anybody who has lost an afternoon because of a 1 character mistake in their coding understands the grim insights from the proverb \"For Want of a Nail\".\nHowever, for non coding activities such errors or omittances are more subtle, as the fallout from things tends to be less direct (such as for lost capacity, imprecision or diminished returns).\nTo return to the proverb, the nail is the instigator of a chain of events, rather than a technical or procedural.\nPeople are unlikely to posit \"For Want of Annealing\" to highlight the pernicious effects of qualified deficiencies.\nThe consequence of this presentation will be to demonstrate how underutilized qualitative and graph orientated approaches are for modern project management.</p>"

From a being just a wild idea back in 2019, the language has grown into a small community of users (roughly measured by its ~1.8k GitHub stars). With growth, the language's strengths and weaknesses became more evident, and with those come feature requests. How to keep the language small and still address the needs of users, while remaining faithful to the spirit of Lua and not falling into pitfalls from the past? In this talk we'll discuss some pragmatic choices in Teal's design that were made to balance those concerns: to make it more powerful, while keeping it small.</p>"

    abstract: "<p>Open source has been highly democratized thanks to a clear OSI defintion. In a Digital infrastrcuture world, now it is the time for APIs to have such open and clear defintion. Inspired by Open Source, this talk will present the FACT framework, a way to create and publish easily Fair API Commitment Terms, making API Terms of Service that are easy to read and understand.\nIndeed, the biggest threat on trust in the digital infrastructure we know is the threat on APIs you consume for your software. What if the API provider breaks the API? What if the API provider change its licence? Its version abruptly making it a breaking version without notice? Its pricing making it unaffordable for all users? This is why we have worked to make a framework to make it easy to provide clear open commitment about your APIs to your community.\nIt is like a Creative Commons for APIs, as it is also easy to read and understand for users about what they can expect about API provider commitments about trust for their API.\nThis project has been supported by the Ford Foundation, Mozilla foundation and Open Society foundation.rThis talk will present the FACT framework, a way to create and publish easily Fair API Commitment Terms, making API Terms of Service that are easy to read and understand.\nIndeed, the biggest threat on trust in the digital infrastructure we know is the threat on APIs you consume for your software.

        abstract: "<p>AletheiaFact.org is a movement for the democratization of fact-checking in Brazil, which aims to empower ordinary citizens to check and monitor information in order to prevent the harmful spread of fake news and create a digital community engaged in teaching, learning and sharing knowledge on the subject. We are also a technological platform that offers tools in workflow format to make fact-checking processes accessible and feasible for everyone.</p>\n<p>In an era where misinformation can spread rapidly, establishing robust and reliable fact-checking platforms is crucial. This presentation delves into the unique journey of developing a Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) fact-checking platform specifically for the Brazilian community. We explore the intersection of technology, journalism, and civic engagement in the context of Brazil's diverse and dynamic information landscape.</p>\n<p>Brazil, with its rich cultural and linguistic diversity, presents unique challenges in misinformation management. Our project aims not only to address these challenges but also to harness the power of the open-source community in creating a transparent and accountable fact-checking tool. We will discuss the technical hurdles in building a scalable and effective platform, including aspects like real-time data analysis, integration with various media formats, and ensuring user-friendly interfaces that cater to a broad audience.</p>\n<p>Additionally, we focus on the vital role of community engagement in the development and adoption of the platform. The talk will cover strategies for fostering an active open-source community around the project, encouraging collaboration, and ensuring the platform evolves in response to the community's needs.</p>"

However, in this talk, we’ll explore how compliance is not just a legal necessity but a communal responsibility that can significantly enhance open-source projects' trust, sustainability, and success.</p>\n<p>We will delve into the idea that compliance should be a collective effort seamlessly integrated into the fabric of the open-source community. By engaging the core developers, occasional contributors, and end-users, compliance becomes an inclusive, transparent process that upholds the spirit of open collaboration and innovation.</p>"

        abstract: "<p>Leaders in developing AI from openAI, Deepmind and Anthropic signed the following statement :\n\"Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war.\"</p>\n<p>What exactly is that risk, where does it come from, and how can the open source community work on AI to be as beneficial as possible while avoiding these risks? </p>\n<p>Jonathan Claybrough, software engineer from the European Network for AI Safety will briefly introduce the topic and main sources of risk, in about ten minutes, then will open the floor to an expert panel of speakers on AI governance and open source. We plan to interact heavily with the audience so that the open source community gets represented in AI governance. \nThe panel experts will be Alexandra Tsalidis from the Future of Life Institute's Policy team and Felicity Redel on the foresight team at ICFG. \nStefania Delprete, data scientist with extensive experience with the opensource community (Python and Mozilla), will be moderating the session. </p>\n<p>Key points of the presentation\n- Current vulnerabilities you expose yourself to using AI models (low robustness, hallucinations, trojans, ..)  <br />\n- Open weights of AI models doesn't bring the guarantees of open source (you can't read the code, debug, modify precisely)<br />\n- Steps to reduce user (developers) risk (model cards, open datasets)<br />\n- Steps to reduce misuse risk (capability evaluations, scoped applications, responsible release)<br />\nExpert panel debate questions:<br />\n- What are downside risks of unrestricted open source AI proliferation?<br />\n- What would a governance of open source AI models that leads to good outcomes look like? <br />\n- How can the open source community contribute to AI Safety?</p>"

    abstract: "<p>Not to sound like an alarmist, but the free internet is in crisis. Corporations and bad actors treat people like products and mine their personal data and passions for profit. So we must convene as a community to save the internet — but how, when by virtuous design we as a community are distributed and decentralized? By learning from the distributed teams who have been responsible for reacting in crisis situations for centuries. In this talk, I’ll explore how we can apply social network analysis findings gleaned from studying disaster response teams in laboratory and field settings to empower leadership and strengthen community ties in pursuit of our collective goal: to ensure the internet is free, open, and safe for all, forever.</p>"

And we need to tell the world, again.</p>\n<p>At the same time, proprietary systems and vendors are winning pitches in government and elsewhere that should be no-brainers for Open Source solutions.</p>\n<p>What comes next, and what do we have to do to make sure we can continue to make a positive difference with Open Source in the future?</p>\n<p>This session will explore open source at different scales, from small but meaningful, to vast and vital to our future. What has open source made possible? What have we done with it in the last 24 years?</p>\n<p>A look back at our origins, the changes and opportunities open source has enabled from small and personal to large. What could applying open source philosophy and practices — \"thinking open source\" — bring to society, the world, and the future beyond our daily work and business, from promoting peaceful and democratic societies to providing international development aid?</p>\n<p>Openness and sharing, good governance and democracy. Can open source practice teach us how to live in a peaceful, free, and democratic society?</p>\n<p><strong>SAID ABOUT THIS TALK:</strong></p>\n<p>“This session came with the best value I've experienced myself for ages. I'm so glad I went there, the impact of FOSS principles to our societies is totally underrated. It was overwhelming!”</p>"

        abstract: "<p>Leaders in developing AI from openAI, Deepmind and Anthropic signed the following statement :\n\"Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war.\"</p>\n<p>What exactly is that risk, where does it come from, and how can the open source community work on AI to be as beneficial as possible while avoiding these risks? </p>\n<p>Jonathan Claybrough, software engineer from the European Network for AI Safety will briefly introduce the topic and main sources of risk, in about ten minutes, then will open the floor to an expert panel of speakers on AI governance and open source. We plan to interact heavily with the audience so that the open source community gets represented in AI governance. \nThe panel experts will be Alexandra Tsalidis from the Future of Life Institute's Policy team and Felicity Redel on the foresight team at ICFG. \nStefania Delprete, data scientist with extensive experience with the opensource community (Python and Mozilla), will be moderating the session. </p>\n<p>Key points of the presentation\n- Current vulnerabilities you expose yourself to using AI models (low robustness, hallucinations, trojans, ..)  <br />\n- Open weights of AI models doesn't bring the guarantees of open source (you can't read the code, debug, modify precisely)<br />\n- Steps to reduce user (developers) risk (model cards, open datasets)<br />\n- Steps to reduce misuse risk (capability evaluations, scoped applications, responsible release)<br />\nExpert panel debate questions:<br />\n- What are downside risks of unrestricted open source AI proliferation?<br />\n- What would a governance of open source AI models that leads to good outcomes look like? <br />\n- How can the open source community contribute to AI Safety?</p>"

        abstract: "<p>As an open community grows the amount of external contributions increases with it. This is one of the primary benefits of open communities: the assimilation of progress from a wide and diverse pool of talent. However, care must be taken to ensure that the process of acceptance is free from social friction, lest arguments bring down and delay development of the project. This lightning talk covers the social issues open community maintainers and external contributors face during the submission of a patch or other change, why conflicts arise between parties, and how to handle difficult public disagreements to bring threads of discussions back on topic to focus on the benefit of the project and community. Synergy is when multiple parties come together to produce something greater than the sum of their parts, and it's what we will strive for in this talk.</p>"

        url: "https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/event/fosdem-2024-1938-strategies-for-building-healthy-open-source-communities/"
        abstract: "<p>Building healthy and vibrant open source communities that are sustained over time can be a struggle, especially when maintainers are already exhausted and overworked with the regular day to day work on the project. It’s not easy, and there is no one size fits all magic solution to building healthy communities. However, there are some strategies you can use to increase your chances of being successful.</p>\n<p>This talk has three sections. First, a discussion of the strategies that can be employed to build healthy communities, including performing the work in the open and how good governance, contributor ladders, and roadmaps can help you grow diverse contributor communities. Second, how to take a strategic approach to metrics that help you align your unique goals, and  build healthy open source communities. Finally, the talk will include tips and techniques for interpreting what the metrics are telling you in ways that allow you to take action to continuously improve the health of your open source communities.</p>\n<p>This talk focuses on how to take a strategic approach to building FOSS communities and how the smart use of metrics can help you continuously measure your progress and improve community health. Whether you are working in an open source project on behalf of a company or as an individual, you will walk away from this talk with strategies, techniques, and metrics for building healthy communities around your open source projects.</p>"

But let's take a look at what questions (or risks) an open approach may carry.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What does being an open community actually mean?</li>\n<li>How to ensure information security in an open community?</li>\n<li>How to set up communication in the community that is both open and efficient?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the <a href=\"https://cesko.digital/\">Česko.Digital</a> community, we have more than 6000 members from different areas. There are volunteers, people from non-profits or public administration, representatives of various businesses, supporters, and more. Since the beginning, we have built our community on open principles in many aspects of our functioning. However, we have reached a point where we are running into the possible limits of this approach. In the past months, we have been looking for answers to (not only) the questions stated above, and I would like to share with you the insights from our journey.</p>"

    abstract: "<p>Accessibility is a key requirement in modern web applications — not only because of new legislative requirements (like the European Accessibility Act), but because it is also a human right and a cornerstone of an inclusive society.</p>\n<p>This presentation aims to shed light on the on the different kinds of barriers a user might encounter in a modern web application (especially in the context of the \"usual suspects\" of content management systems like <a href=\"https://wordpress.org\">Wordpress</a> or <a href=\"https://typo3.org\">TYPO3</a>), and also show that there are some barriers that all users may encounter, regardless of their physical or mental ability. Instead, some barriers may arise from the technology available to a user (who possibly only has access to a low-end device, works with a spotty network connection or does not have access to a required input device), the education of a user, their language comprehension and many other factors. We will explore key accessibility principles to allow users to overcome these barriers and share real-world practical examples to illustrate the impact of accessible design on user experience and inclusivity.</p>\n<p>We will provide actionable strategies for developers and UX designers to enhance accessibility working with or on these CMS frameworks. Attendees will gain insights into optimizing software and content for diverse user needs, ensuring compliance with global accessibility standards and regulatory requirements (like the European Accessibility Act), and leveraging the latest technologies to create a more inclusive digital landscape.</p>"

        abstract: "<p>Web Accessibility has a lot of complexities, and most CMS do not have the capacity to invest in it sufficiently. Two years ago Funka organized a Cross-CMS initiative to look at supporting content authors in their efforts to produce accessible content. This EC funded initiative, the We4Authors Cluster brought together Drupal, Joomla, Plone, and Umbreco. This is the only cross-CMS accessibility event I am aware of where maintainers collaborated on common UI elements. It is also the only one I am aware of where user research was done on authors, to help evaluate accessibility. We need more of this.  </p>\n<p>Currently, Environmental Sustainability in the CMS space is given even less of a priority than accessibility. We are in a climate crisis, digital tools are contributing to it, global best practices are emerging, but adoption of these best practices isn't happening fast enough. Collaboration is needed to both raise awareness within our industry, but also find common solutions. Finding common approaches to measure the CO2 impact is an important starting point. Much more will be needed if we are to help the web make significant reductions in energy consumption. </p>\n<p>These are two places where collaboration is key if we are able to make the advances which are needed for people with disabilities, as well as future generations. Where can we help to optimize our development process, code execution, and the cumulative impact of CO2 produced through the process.</p>"

We explore disciplines that provide language support, privacy, data protection, security, and safety for the disability community. This talk relates to everyone involved in the design of digital technologies which includes standards, policies, applications, and more. Technology designers from different disciplines are increasingly confronted with the topic of accessibility for people with disabilities, yet are often unsure how to approach it. Sensitivities often prevent efficient interaction among designers from different disciplines. This workshop is open to all - designers, developers, digital rights activists, usability consultants, and accessibility consultants. One does not require specific expertise to participate. People with backgrounds in collecting feedback from users and open-source tool teams who have integrated and implemented usability and accessibility improvements based on user feedback are welcome. </p>\n<p>The talk will share best practices and resources that comply with accessibility best practices and how one can achieve the desirable accessibility standard. The talk will also share the results or examples of feedback collected from people with disabilities, outlining specific gaps in the accessibility of current open-source tools such as BigBlueButton, Jitsi, RiseUp Pad, Crypto Pad, Tella, Destiny, CDR Link, Círculo, etc.</p>\n<p>Participants will have a </p>\n<p>Participants will also have a 1) Comprehensive understanding of the accessibility status of popular open-source tools by learning about the common accessibility myths. </p>\n<p>2) Understand the dire need for adopting accessibility standards to foster digital inclusion for people with disabilities.</p>\n<p>3) The socio-economic benefits of  making privacy and security tools more accessible by incorporating principles of web-accessibility.</p>"

        abstract: "<p>Join us for a discussion aimed at supporting Linux distribution developers in enhancing accessibility. As blind software engineers, we believe we can bring a unique perspective to this essential endeavor.\nWe'll explore the challenges faced by blind users when using the Linux desktop environment, with a focus on constructive solutions. We will discuss two main topics: lack of preinstalled assistive technologies and accessibility problems of basic components of desktop environments. Our goal is to offer guidance and encouragement to developers, empowering them to create more inclusive experiences for all users.\nIn our vision for the ideal accessibility scenario, Linux distributions seamlessly accommodate the needs of blind users. To achieve this, we'll stress the importance of collaboration among developers and upstream projects, ensuring that accessibility becomes a fundamental consideration in the development process.\nAdditionally, we'll introduce the \"Linux Accessibility Guide\", a valuable resource that can assist developers in making graphical applications more accessible. This guide will offer practical insights and best practices to support their efforts.\nJoin us as we embark on a journey to improve the accessibility of Linux distributions, fostering an environment where accessibility is a shared goal, benefiting blind users and the entire Linux community. Together, we can create a more accessible and inclusive Linux desktop experience.</p>"

In comparison, Drupal has historically had no centralised product management or marketing, let alone ANY coordinated budget! This talk will look at the challenges Drupal is facing now that it competes head to head with proprietary giants like Adobe in the enterprise sector. From the perspective of his role on the Drupal Association board, Owen will discuss the strategies and initiatives the Drupal community is starting to put in place to remain competitive and how these approaches can be shared by other open source projects.</p>"

        abstract: "<p>This talk is about our Journey as an Open Source creator, project maintainer and company, from being alone creating the Open Source software XWiki and the associated company, to the first users and contributors, first hires, first clients, growing the company over the years to more than 50 people, fully bootstrapped. It is about the struggles to compete with proprietary software and then having customers asking to transition from their provider forcing them to a 5x more expensive offer. It is about creating a new product CryptPad and running 2 open source communities and our journey providing a privacy protecting software. It is about licenses and the temptation to close some code to be able to be more successful and finally finding other ways. It is about the joys of building Open Source together as a team, how you meet other FOSS people, at FOSDEM, in local communities or in business conferences, and collaborate and share your passion and beliefs. It is about Digital Sovereignty. It's also about what we could have done differently if we knew. It is about how you can live from Open Source, while respecting your contributors, your users , your customers and your employees.\nI hope this talk, sharing our experience will help other FOSS lovers be able also to live from Open Source and push them to move to full time Open Source. As for many companies, our story is somewhat a roller coaster with its set of successes and failures. Open Source success takes time, but good things can come for those who are resilient enough.</p>"

    abstract: "<p>Since 1987, Copyleft licensing has been the primary strategy of the FOSS community to guarantee users' rights to copy, share, modify, redistribute, and reinstall modified versions of their software.   In our earliest days, we naïvely thought that the GPL would work like magic pixie dust; we'd sprinkle it on our code, and our code would remain free as in freedom.</p>\n<p>The reality check that we've received over the last 35 years has been painful on this issue.  While this talk will cover the few huge successes in copyleft enforcement that have lead to real improvements to the rights and freedoms of users, we'll also face frankly the compromises made and false paths taken in the earliest days, that have now led to a simple but unfortunate fact: almost every Linux-based device for sale on the market today does <em>not</em> comply with Linux's license (the GPLv2).</p>\n<p>This talk will not only discuss the primary past GPL enforcement efforts around the world, but also provide a whirlwind tour of how copyleft came to work in practice, how we wished it had worked, and discuss ideas, suggestions, and plans for the future strategies in copyleft that, informed by this history, are our best hope for software freedom and rights.</p>\n<p>Have ever wondered how FOSS was <em>actually</em> was supposed <em>stay</em> FOSS for the long term?  Have you ever been unsure or confused why — in a world where Linux is on nearly every device —  most people cannot actually run an alternative OS build on their device?  This talk will leave you informed on these questions and prepared to participate in the next policy steps our community must take to bring back software freedom and rights to the next generation of FOSS users, activists and developers.</p>"

The impact goes beyond our daily work — it is everywhere — we won!

What has open source made possible? What have we done with it in the last 24 years?</p>\n<p>A look back at our origins, the changes and opportunities open source has enabled from small and personal to large.

The community of\ncopyleft experts are discussing and considering what to do.  Specifically, we\nhave seen more than once vendors confusing their users: by adding further\nrestrictions to GPLv3/AGPLv3 in a way that confuses users about their right to\nremove those “further restrictions” and the right to exercise their full\nsoftware freedom.</p>\n<p>This panel discussion will investigate the various different nuances of the\nissue, including some examples. The panel includes Bradley M. Kuhn, who\nauthored an expert report in support of PureThink and John Mark Suhy in the\nNeo4j v.

By engaging the core developers, occasional contributors, and end-users, compliance becomes an inclusive, transparent process that upholds the spirit of open collaboration and innovation.</p>"

        abstract: "<p>Since 1987, Copyleft licensing has been the primary strategy of the FOSS community to guarantee users' rights to copy, share, modify, redistribute, and reinstall modified versions of their software.   In our earliest days, we naïvely thought that the GPL would work like magic pixie dust; we'd sprinkle it on our code, and our code would remain free as in freedom.</p>\n<p>The reality check that we've received over the last 35 years has been painful on this issue.  While this talk will cover the few huge successes in copyleft enforcement that have lead to real improvements to the rights and freedoms of users, we'll also face frankly the compromises made and false paths taken in the earliest days, that have now led to a simple but unfortunate fact: almost every Linux-based device for sale on the market today does <em>not</em> comply with Linux's license (the GPLv2).</p>\n<p>This talk will not only discuss the primary past GPL enforcement efforts around the world, but also provide a whirlwind tour of how copyleft came to work in practice, how we wished it had worked, and discuss ideas, suggestions, and plans for the future strategies in copyleft that, informed by this history, are our best hope for software freedom and rights.</p>\n<p>Have ever wondered how FOSS was <em>actually</em> was supposed <em>stay</em> FOSS for the long term?  Have you ever been unsure or confused why — in a world where Linux is on nearly every device —  most people cannot actually run an alternative OS build on their device?  This talk will leave you informed on these questions and prepared to participate in the next policy steps our community must take to bring back software freedom and rights to the next generation of FOSS users, activists and developers.</p>"

        abstract: "<p><strong>Open Source technology, practices, and thinking have revolutionized how we innovate, collaborate, and do business. The impact goes beyond our daily work — it is everywhere — we won! But there's a downside: We have forgotten to tell people what makes us and Open Source different.</strong></p>\n<p>We must remember how radical and important Open Source is. It is extraordinary that we build international communities of experts sharing our best ideas, building businesses, and creating value.</p>\n<p>Open Source — and we — have the potential to create more positive change in the world. And we need to tell the world, again.</p>\n<p>At the same time, proprietary systems and vendors are winning pitches in government and elsewhere that should be no-brainers for Open Source solutions.</p>\n<p>What comes next, and what do we have to do to make sure we can continue to make a positive difference with Open Source in the future?</p>\n<p>This session will explore open source at different scales, from small but meaningful, to vast and vital to our future. What has open source made possible? What have we done with it in the last 24 years?</p>\n<p>A look back at our origins, the changes and opportunities open source has enabled from small and personal to large. What could applying open source philosophy and practices — \"thinking open source\" — bring to society, the world, and the future beyond our daily work and business, from promoting peaceful and democratic societies to providing international development aid?</p>\n<p>Openness and sharing, good governance and democracy. Can open source practice teach us how to live in a peaceful, free, and democratic society?</p>\n<p><strong>SAID ABOUT THIS TALK:</strong></p>\n<p>“This session came with the best value I've experienced myself for ages. I'm so glad I went there, the impact of FOSS principles to our societies is totally underrated. It was overwhelming!”</p>"

        abstract: "<p>In the Free and Open Source world, compliance often gets a reputation as a complex, back-end process, seemingly distant from the daily workflow of developers and contributors. However, in this talk, we’ll explore how compliance is not just a legal necessity but a communal responsibility that can significantly enhance open-source projects' trust, sustainability, and success.</p>\n<p>We will delve into the idea that compliance should be a collective effort seamlessly integrated into the fabric of the open-source community. By engaging the core developers, occasional contributors, and end-users, compliance becomes an inclusive, transparent process that upholds the spirit of open collaboration and innovation.</p>"

        abstract: "<p>There's been quite a bit of excitement around Enterprise Linux over the last few years, and that's made some people quite nervous, and others downright angry. This has left many confused about the state of Enterprise Linux. In open source, transparency, and sharing of ideas is critical. But it's more than just what you share, it's how you share it. This talk will delve into the state of Enterprise Linux from Red Hat's perspective and share it in a community driven way.</p>\n<p>The upstream and downstream relationships that make up the RHEL supply chain contribute to what is arguably the largest and most sophisticated open source supply chain in the world. This large, sophisticated supply chain, and all of the Independent Software Developers (ISVs) involved, give RHEL a lot of gravity, probably more than any other open source product.</p>\n<p>For years, I think many of us in the open source world assumed that we knew everything there was to know about open source, but the truth is, we’re all still learning. In the last couple of years, there have been some big changes in the Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) supply chain, often referred to as Enterprise Linux or EL for short. This talk will try to share a representative opinion from Red Hat about where we see Enterprise Linux today, where we think it's going, and where we'd like to take it.</p>"

    abstract: "<p>Ethical AI has emerged as a pivotal global discourse, reflecting the growing realization of its profound impact on societies worldwide. While social issues give rise to policy solutions and thus legislations, ethics are deeply rooted in societal values that differ greatly from one jurisdiction to another. In the last decade, diverse groups and individuals have departed from using exclusively Free Software licenses on their projects to developing new types of licensing solutions which prioritize “ethical” restrictions on how software should be further used and distributed. In this talk, I will delve into the ethical dimensions of the convergence of AI and Free Software, examining the challenges and opportunities in building responsible and ethical AI solutions within the free software ecosystem.</p>\n<p>This talk firstly provides examples of some of the most common licensing models imposing “ethical” restrictions. It then examines how licensing models imposing additional behavior restrictions that supposedly call themselves “open” are in contravention of the definitions of Free Software and Open Source Software. We will further explore some predominant material harms emanating from the use of these restrictive licenses. Lastly, given the various technical &amp; legal obstacles in using these restrictive licenses, I implore that the ethical compliance checks must fall within the purview of regulations and not software licenses.</p>\n<p>Given the proliferation of ethical licenses in AI landscapes causing additional behavior restrictions, integration of Free Software, license compatibility and licensing compliance become more complex, affecting the whole ecosystem. This presentation seeks to increase awareness about this crucial issue, particularly as public funds are being allocated to AI projects that may, at times, employ restrictive licensing practices.</p>"

The Open Source Initiative is inviting developers of AI and users to find the principles of Open Source applied to AI systems. </p>\n<p>Finding an agreement on what constitutes Open Source AI is the most important challenge facing the free software (also known as open source) movement. European regulation already started referring to \"free and open source AI\", large economic actors like Meta are calling their systems \"open source\" despite the fact that their license contain restrictions on fields-of-use (among other things) and the landscape is evolving so quickly that if we don't keep up, we'll be irrelevant.</p>\n<p>The session will have a short introduction to the project, which started mid-2023, followed by a summary of the most current draft of the Definition. The bulk of the session will be an assignment for the audience: to review the draft Definition and provide comments. The responses will be used as feedback to release a new draft.</p>"

    abstract: "<p>AI models, particularly LLMs, readily and sometimes unwittingly may plagiarize content—what constitutes acceptable use is currently not fully resolved— opening their users to copyright tort and other forms of litigation. For society an immanent danger is also in how easily they can be poisoned or lobotomized to propagate disinformation. It is also difficult to uncover and address sources of bias. The later is of particular legislative concern—see emerging regulations such as the EU’s AI Act as a prototype for whats to come. Without traceability for data with clear license expressions and provenance, AI models are easy targets. The open source community are particularly vulnerable and defenseless. Without a preemptive strategy legal risks are untenable. We expect an avalanche of litigation in response to AI driven disruption of the business of established information providers and creatives.\nThe talk focuses on both the legal and moral issues at hand but also the means to address the issues through traceability and model governance.</p>"

        abstract: "<p>Progressively, there are more and more risks associated with computer intelligence, and as a transparent software company we have the responsibility to intervene and protect our users. Recently, Microsoft laid off its entire ethics and society team, the team that taught employees how to make AI tools responsibly. Nextcloud on the other hand, embraces the ethics and challenges that make up today’s AI and aims to take them head on.</p>\n<p>The field of AI is moving fast, and many of the new capabilities face ethical and even legal challenges.</p>\n<p>For example, there are problems with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Privacy and security of user data</li>\n<li>Discrimination and biases</li>\n<li>Energy usage</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In particular with neural networks based AI technologies, the mere availability of open source code is no longer enough to be able to say you are in control over your data or that the software is safe or ethical. The set of data and the software used in the training, as well as the availability of the final model are all factors that determine the amount of freedom and control a user has.</p>\n<p>Until Hub 3, we succeeded in offering features like related resources, recommended files, our priority inbox and even face and object recognition without reliance on proprietary blobs or third party servers.</p>\n<p>Yet, while there is a large community developing ethical, safe and privacy-respecting technologies, there are many other relevant technologies users might want to use. We want to provide users these cutting-edge technologies – but also be transparent. For some use cases, ChatGPT might be a reasonable solution, while for other data, it is paramount to have a local, on-prem, open solution. To differentiate these, we developed an Ethical AI Rating.</p>\n<p>Our Ethical AI Rating is designed to give a quick insight into the ethical implications of a particular integration of AI in Nextcloud. We of course still encourage users to look more deeply into the specific solution they use, but hope that this way we simplify the choice for the majority of our users and customers.</p>\n<p>I will describe how our Ethical AI rating works, and give a bunch of examples. And, as a bonus, show how it is integrated in Nextcloud and how it can help you get work done - without leaking your data!</p>\n<p>I look forward to any feedback you wonderful folks in the audience have.</p>"

We have come a long way to improve diversity and inclusion of the open-source ecosystem but the battle does not stop here.

        abstract: "<p>Building healthy and vibrant open source communities that are sustained over time can be a struggle, especially when maintainers are already exhausted and overworked with the regular day to day work on the project. It’s not easy, and there is no one size fits all magic solution to building healthy communities. However, there are some strategies you can use to increase your chances of being successful.</p>\n<p>This talk has three sections. First, a discussion of the strategies that can be employed to build healthy communities, including performing the work in the open and how good governance, contributor ladders, and roadmaps can help you grow diverse contributor communities. Second, how to take a strategic approach to metrics that help you align your unique goals, and  build healthy open source communities. Finally, the talk will include tips and techniques for interpreting what the metrics are telling you in ways that allow you to take action to continuously improve the health of your open source communities.</p>\n<p>This talk focuses on how to take a strategic approach to building FOSS communities and how the smart use of metrics can help you continuously measure your progress and improve community health. Whether you are working in an open source project on behalf of a company or as an individual, you will walk away from this talk with strategies, techniques, and metrics for building healthy communities around your open source projects.</p>"

The impact goes beyond our daily work — it is everywhere — we won! But there's a downside: We have forgotten to tell people what makes us and Open Source different.</strong></p>\n<p>We must remember how radical and important Open Source is. It is extraordinary that we build international communities of experts sharing our best ideas, building businesses, and creating value.</p>\n<p>Open Source — and we — have the potential to create more positive change in the world. And we need to tell the world, again.</p>\n<p>At the same time, proprietary systems and vendors are winning pitches in government and elsewhere that should be no-brainers for Open Source solutions.</p>\n<p>What comes next, and what do we have to do to make sure we can continue to make a positive difference with Open Source in the future?</p>\n<p>This session will explore open source at different scales, from small but meaningful, to vast and vital to our future. What has open source made possible? What have we done with it in the last 24 years?</p>\n<p>A look back at our origins, the changes and opportunities open source has enabled from small and personal to large. What could applying open source philosophy and practices — \"thinking open source\" — bring to society, the world, and the future beyond our daily work and business, from promoting peaceful and democratic societies to providing international development aid?</p>\n<p>Openness and sharing, good governance and democracy. Can open source practice teach us how to live in a peaceful, free, and democratic society?</p>\n<p><strong>SAID ABOUT THIS TALK:</strong></p>\n<p>“This session came with the best value I've experienced myself for ages. I'm so glad I went there, the impact of FOSS principles to our societies is totally underrated. It was overwhelming!”</p>"

It’s also important for individuals to chart their own path that aligns with their unique experience and interest. </p>\n<p>In this panel discussion, panelists will share how they got started in their career and their journey over the past two decades. For people looking for jobs in open source, we’ll discuss what we look for in candidates and why it’s not necessary to check all the boxes in job descriptions. We’ll also discuss challenges in balancing your day jobs vs. open source activities during your career. </p>\n<p>In addition, we’ll also delve into other challenges and opportunities of an open source career that range from dealing with the impostor syndrome, DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) challenges, exploring open source communities for self growth, and more. </p>\n<p>The goal of this session is to help attendees feel more comfortable exploring opportunities in open source and be confident in charting their own path. Our panel members will share what contributed to their success and the lessons learned throughout their extensive experience in open source. This session is meant to be interactive, and we’ll encourage attendees to ask questions and engage in the conversation.</p>"

        abstract: "<p>We’ve heard it for decades - being an open source maintainer is full-time job in itself. Writing features and maintaining the project are expected, but a project needs more than good features to create a robust community around it. Open source organizational design is usually an after thought but it doesn’t have to be. Taking the time to define those “hats” early on can help a project grow and be sustainable enough to not rely on a few maintainers to do it all. In this session, Paris Pittman will share her experience helping maintainers avoid burnout, handle governance operations, increase adopters, and building plans for community. </p>\n<p>Is moderating your mailing list or chat platform something you want to do for the duration of the project as a lead maintainer? What about creating and writing all of the onboarding materials needed for contributors and users alike? In this session, we will draw from open source projects like Kubernetes, Swift, and others so that audience members will take away an action plan on building out intentional community roles, groups, and more so the many hats of maintainers are shared.</p>"

        abstract: "<p>Progressively, there are more and more risks associated with computer intelligence, and as a transparent software company we have the responsibility to intervene and protect our users. Recently, Microsoft laid off its entire ethics and society team, the team that taught employees how to make AI tools responsibly. Nextcloud on the other hand, embraces the ethics and challenges that make up today’s AI and aims to take them head on.</p>\n<p>The field of AI is moving fast, and many of the new capabilities face ethical and even legal challenges.</p>\n<p>For example, there are problems with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Privacy and security of user data</li>\n<li>Discrimination and biases</li>\n<li>Energy usage</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In particular with neural networks based AI technologies, the mere availability of open source code is no longer enough to be able to say you are in control over your data or that the software is safe or ethical. The set of data and the software used in the training, as well as the availability of the final model are all factors that determine the amount of freedom and control a user has.</p>\n<p>Until Hub 3, we succeeded in offering features like related resources, recommended files, our priority inbox and even face and object recognition without reliance on proprietary blobs or third party servers.</p>\n<p>Yet, while there is a large community developing ethical, safe and privacy-respecting technologies, there are many other relevant technologies users might want to use. We want to provide users these cutting-edge technologies – but also be transparent. For some use cases, ChatGPT might be a reasonable solution, while for other data, it is paramount to have a local, on-prem, open solution. To differentiate these, we developed an Ethical AI Rating.</p>\n<p>Our Ethical AI Rating is designed to give a quick insight into the ethical implications of a particular integration of AI in Nextcloud. We of course still encourage users to look more deeply into the specific solution they use, but hope that this way we simplify the choice for the majority of our users and customers.</p>\n<p>I will describe how our Ethical AI rating works, and give a bunch of examples. And, as a bonus, show how it is integrated in Nextcloud and how it can help you get work done - without leaking your data!</p>\n<p>I look forward to any feedback you wonderful folks in the audience have.</p>"

        abstract: "<p>AI models, particularly LLMs, readily and sometimes unwittingly may plagiarize content—what constitutes acceptable use is currently not fully resolved— opening their users to copyright tort and other forms of litigation. For society an immanent danger is also in how easily they can be poisoned or lobotomized to propagate disinformation. It is also difficult to uncover and address sources of bias. The later is of particular legislative concern—see emerging regulations such as the EU’s AI Act as a prototype for whats to come. Without traceability for data with clear license expressions and provenance, AI models are easy targets. The open source community are particularly vulnerable and defenseless. Without a preemptive strategy legal risks are untenable. We expect an avalanche of litigation in response to AI driven disruption of the business of established information providers and creatives.\nThe talk focuses on both the legal and moral issues at hand but also the means to address the issues through traceability and model governance.</p>"

        abstract: "<p>Ethical AI has emerged as a pivotal global discourse, reflecting the growing realization of its profound impact on societies worldwide. While social issues give rise to policy solutions and thus legislations, ethics are deeply rooted in societal values that differ greatly from one jurisdiction to another. In the last decade, diverse groups and individuals have departed from using exclusively Free Software licenses on their projects to developing new types of licensing solutions which prioritize “ethical” restrictions on how software should be further used and distributed. In this talk, I will delve into the ethical dimensions of the convergence of AI and Free Software, examining the challenges and opportunities in building responsible and ethical AI solutions within the free software ecosystem.</p>\n<p>This talk firstly provides examples of some of the most common licensing models imposing “ethical” restrictions. It then examines how licensing models imposing additional behavior restrictions that supposedly call themselves “open” are in contravention of the definitions of Free Software and Open Source Software. We will further explore some predominant material harms emanating from the use of these restrictive licenses. Lastly, given the various technical &amp; legal obstacles in using these restrictive licenses, I implore that the ethical compliance checks must fall within the purview of regulations and not software licenses.</p>\n<p>Given the proliferation of ethical licenses in AI landscapes causing additional behavior restrictions, integration of Free Software, license compatibility and licensing compliance become more complex, affecting the whole ecosystem. This presentation seeks to increase awareness about this crucial issue, particularly as public funds are being allocated to AI projects that may, at times, employ restrictive licensing practices.</p>"

        abstract: "<p>A fast-paced workshop where you'll be asked to co-design a piece of the Open Source AI Definition. The Open Source Initiative is inviting developers of AI and users to find the principles of Open Source applied to AI systems. </p>\n<p>Finding an agreement on what constitutes Open Source AI is the most important challenge facing the free software (also known as open source) movement. European regulation already started referring to \"free and open source AI\", large economic actors like Meta are calling their systems \"open source\" despite the fact that their license contain restrictions on fields-of-use (among other things) and the landscape is evolving so quickly that if we don't keep up, we'll be irrelevant.</p>\n<p>The session will have a short introduction to the project, which started mid-2023, followed by a summary of the most current draft of the Definition. The bulk of the session will be an assignment for the audience: to review the draft Definition and provide comments. The responses will be used as feedback to release a new draft.</p>"

        abstract: "<p>This talk delves into the evolution of Ubuntu Touch on PINE64 devices since its release in 2020. Over the past several years there have been significant changes, both to the development team and the codebase.  </p>\n<p>The shifts in the UBPorts/PINE64 community stem from the original PinePhone port’s maintainer moving on from the project, which coincided with the release of the PinePhone Pro. This left the community at a crossroads: necessitating the search for a new maintainer and the development of a new port.  </p>\n<p>A key milestone in this journey was the showcasing of an early-stage community port for the PinePhone Pro running on Ubuntu Touch 20.04 at FOSDEM last year. Since then, a new maintainer has achieved remarkable improvements, including porting 20.04 to the original PinePhone and PineTab, as well as the newly released PineTab2.  </p>\n<p>This presentation will explore the challenges encountered in integrating new devices, updating existing ones, and the process of harmonizing mainline Linux with Ubuntu Touch. This is particularly crucial as Ubuntu Touch has historically leaned towards devices designed for Android/Halium-based devices, somewhat sidelining mainline Linux in the transition to 20.04. Furthermore, the discussion will extend to the future prospects of this port and its implications for Lomiri on mainline Linux across different distributions.</p>"

        abstract: "<p>Marius has been playing around with VoLTE with Qualcomm Mediatek devices. He has got to the point of being able to make and receive calls and send and receive SMSs on Ubuntu Touch ported devices. It is still very hacky. Without any knowledge of the modem stack it seemed impossibly difficult, but now we are getting some insights into how it works it is possible to see how the binary blobs are doing stuff. The way forward was to run Android and capture all the calls made to the drivers. Sailfish have some of it working, so their solution provided tools too.</p>\n<p>The fixes so far are very specific, every proprietary system has its own unique way of doing things. It is a horrible standard, and no carrier even follows the standard. The modem is a black box with no outputs. To be honest, when it works, we don’t know why it works. It works perfectly well, though, so result. He would like to share his results, to discuss with the wider community how we can roll this out to get more devices supported.</p>\n<p>In the recent and coming years 2G and 3G are being phased out by network operators, especially on a lot of Mobile Foss OSes that are Halium based. This means that they will be useless because you can't make calls any more. It has been extremely difficult to enable VoLTE service due to all the proprietary components.</p>\n<p>VoLTE stands for Voice over LTE, and LTE (Long Term Evolution) is better known as 4G. So essentially, VoLTE amounts to mobile calls over a 4G network.</p>"

        abstract: "<p>The digital revolution promises us an ever better future for people and the planet. However, while its environmental cost is quite known nowadays, the societal and geopolitical issues triggered are more hidden and taboo. From the extraction of minerals to recycling without forgetting the planned obsolescence, the digital industry is a revolution that is far from keeping all its promises of a radiant future.</p>\n<p>One of the main means for reducing the environmental footprint of digital technology is to extend the lifespan of our devices. Fairphone is a European manufacturer that designs and produces smartphones with the goal of having a lower environmental footprint and better social impact than the norms in the electronics industry. We will speak about how, at Fairphone, we fight planned obsolescence, we will see how the eco-design of hardware modularity is one key for longevity but we will also see the role of open source to make our devices last longer from a software perspective.</p>"

        abstract: "<p>The energy transition implies making decisions under deep uncertainties. Modelling is known to be effective in providing the evidence needed to shape the transformation of the energy sector in the most cost-effective way. Open source is a known approach to increase accessibility of the energy modelling tools. That led to a rapid increase in a number of available energy models whose development is mainly driven by the academic community. However, developments have focused on a few world regions, where awareness of climate change is high. There is still a coverage gap, especially for countries where the energy sector is still highly dependent on fossil fuels.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/pypsa-meets-earth/\">PyPSA meets Earth initiative</a> aims to address this gap by building a global community focused on developing an ecosystem of Pythonic tools, including the modelling framework <a href=\"https://github.com/pypsa-meets-earth/pypsa-earth\">PyPSA-Earth</a>. The framework may be utilised to build a ready-to-use regional power system model by extracting all the required data in a workflow orchestrated by Snakemake. A community approach enables the participation of regional experts in the development and brings modelling closer to real-life applications. </p>\n<p>One of the issues found along this route was the lack of ready-to-use tools to integrate the effects of climate change into power system models. A climate development track in PyPSA-Earth addresses this task and aims to implement approaches to account for changes of climate inputs in a physically correct, yet computationally feasible way. To deal with the regional features of national power systems in a systematic way, a country-wise functionality testing has been carried out. As a result, PyPSA-Earth has been adjusted to be fully capable of building a power system model for any country in the world by a single line of code.</p>\n<p>The presentation will give an overview of the challenges encountered along this way and guide trough the use cases of PyPSA-Earth to tackle the challenges of the energy transition around the globe.</p>"

        abstract: "<p>Web Accessibility has a lot of complexities, and most CMS do not have the capacity to invest in it sufficiently. Two years ago Funka organized a Cross-CMS initiative to look at supporting content authors in their efforts to produce accessible content. This EC funded initiative, the We4Authors Cluster brought together Drupal, Joomla, Plone, and Umbreco. This is the only cross-CMS accessibility event I am aware of where maintainers collaborated on common UI elements. It is also the only one I am aware of where user research was done on authors, to help evaluate accessibility. We need more of this.  </p>\n<p>Currently, Environmental Sustainability in the CMS space is given even less of a priority than accessibility. We are in a climate crisis, digital tools are contributing to it, global best practices are emerging, but adoption of these best practices isn't happening fast enough. Collaboration is needed to both raise awareness within our industry, but also find common solutions. Finding common approaches to measure the CO2 impact is an important starting point. Much more will be needed if we are to help the web make significant reductions in energy consumption. </p>\n<p>These are two places where collaboration is key if we are able to make the advances which are needed for people with disabilities, as well as future generations. Where can we help to optimize our development process, code execution, and the cumulative impact of CO2 produced through the process.</p>"

The community of\ncopyleft experts are discussing and considering what to do.  Specifically, we\nhave seen more than once vendors confusing their users: by adding further\nrestrictions to GPLv3/AGPLv3 in a way that confuses users about their right to\nremove those “further restrictions” and the right to exercise their full\nsoftware freedom.</p>\n<p>This panel discussion will investigate the various different nuances of the\nissue, including some examples. The panel includes Bradley M. Kuhn, who\nauthored an expert report in support of PureThink and John Mark Suhy in the\nNeo4j v. PureThink legal case, and Krzysztof Siewicz, the Free Software\nFoundation's licensing and compliance manager who will be presenting the FSF's\nstewardship of the GPL work to prevent confusing licensing.</p>"

        abstract: "<p>Since 1987, Copyleft licensing has been the primary strategy of the FOSS community to guarantee users' rights to copy, share, modify, redistribute, and reinstall modified versions of their software.   In our earliest days, we naïvely thought that the GPL would work like magic pixie dust; we'd sprinkle it on our code, and our code would remain free as in freedom.</p>\n<p>The reality check that we've received over the last 35 years has been painful on this issue.  While this talk will cover the few huge successes in copyleft enforcement that have lead to real improvements to the rights and freedoms of users, we'll also face frankly the compromises made and false paths taken in the earliest days, that have now led to a simple but unfortunate fact: almost every Linux-based device for sale on the market today does <em>not</em> comply with Linux's license (the GPLv2).</p>\n<p>This talk will not only discuss the primary past GPL enforcement efforts around the world, but also provide a whirlwind tour of how copyleft came to work in practice, how we wished it had worked, and discuss ideas, suggestions, and plans for the future strategies in copyleft that, informed by this history, are our best hope for software freedom and rights.</p>\n<p>Have ever wondered how FOSS was <em>actually</em> was supposed <em>stay</em> FOSS for the long term?  Have you ever been unsure or confused why — in a world where Linux is on nearly every device —  most people cannot actually run an alternative OS build on their device?  This talk will leave you informed on these questions and prepared to participate in the next policy steps our community must take to bring back software freedom and rights to the next generation of FOSS users, activists and developers.</p>"

        abstract: "<p>In 2023, Red Hat changed how it handles Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) source code. The source code for RHEL spent many years being released for free as CentOS Linux, but is now only available through the Red Hat customer interface, limiting access to those who commit to following its user agreements. Those user agreements then limit the use and redistribution of that code. The situation is complicated: While Red Hat claims this is compliant with open source definitions, some NGOs and OSS opinions differ.</p>\n<p>At the same time, we see an expansion of the adoption of open core, and even gatherings of opencore supporters at their own events (https://opencoresummit.com/). Organized by investment capital firms (https://oss.capital/) and defining \"COSS\" (commercial open source software) as the best OSS ever, these events celebrate a disruptive and highly commercial approach to open source. More and more companies are adopting the open core model with varying degrees of success, while Amazon and other companies are moving away from companies using the open core model, embracing \"truly free\" software.</p>\n<p>One thing is for sure: many of the companies adopting open core model  have very effective legal departments and a lot of experience. But how should we - the open source community handle this? Many of us volunteer for open source projects, and the very lucky ones are employed to work on open source projects, but that, too, can bring in a competing motivation. </p>\n<p>From open source projects that are backed by commercial companies needing to provide value to continue to receive the very real funding the projects need, to projects with no commercial backing and massive contributor communities, the answer is likely to be nuanced. How do we ensure the success and continued adoption of open source philosophies while finding a way to call out and de-incentivize openwashing?</p>\n<p>Host: \n    Markus Feilner, Open Source Journalist \nPanel: \n    Liam Proven, (The Register), author of many articles on the topic \n    Karen Sandler, Executive Director, Free Software Conservancy \n    benny Vasquez, Chair, Board of Directors @AlmaLinux OS Foundation</p>"

        abstract: "<p>This talk will first have a look at the previous German rulings on GPL-violations. We will see that the courts were only asked and only ordered that the defendant may not distribute the GPLed software in a GPL-violating way. This leaves one wondering whether the courts would order a defendant to no longer distribute the software at issue at all. This question essentially goes to section 4 of the GPLv2; the so called termination clause. A look into the German Civil Code (sect. 534) reveals us that such automatic termination clauses have to be read as rescission clauses (i.e. as manual termination). We will then look at the sections of the Civil Code which deals with rescission in generally and learn about the separation principle. The talk will conclude with a summary what the copyright holder faced with GPL-violations best does under German law.</p>"
