- (x) investigate higher latency in asia regions
  - context:
    - as of 9th Mar, I have 5 machine instances in fly.io, spread across 5 regions: LHR, LAX, NRT, SYD and SIN
    - however, looking in https://updown.io/vrp1, which is the URL https://fosdem.houseofmoran.io/search?q=Ceph&limit=20, the latency for Asian regions seems to be 1.1s or more, whereas other regions are 723ms or less; see investigations/latency_Mar_2024/fosdem-search-20240309.png
  - (/) change update frequency of updown.io check to once every 15s (from once a minute) to get more data
  - (/) setup opentelemetry to send to honeycomb.io from fly.io
    - (/) ensure it automatically runs in different regions
      - honeycomb may require different endpoints (US vs EU) to be contacted when in different fly.io regions
      - seems to work fine when run in `fra` so will just continue to use the US instance
    - (/) register local/staging/prod as environment attribute
    - (/) add region as an attribute
    - (/) ensure we log to console _and_ to opentelemetry
    - (/) ensure a failure to initialise opentelemetry doesn't kill the app on startup, and it just falls back to default
  - (/) deploy to prod and monitor for a few days
  - (x) try some (safe) experiments:
    - (/) switch all machines to be in US (lax), on assumption it is the hop to OpenAI which is the slow part
      - I tried this and it made latencies worse; see investigations/latency_Mar_2024/fosdem-search-20240316.png
        - (/) reverted to having a single machine in each of sin,syd,nrt,lhr,lax
    - apply some speedups on top of OpenAI call:
      - (x) from traces, it looks like dispatching `find_related_events` async on separate threads doesn't have much benefit as traces still look like a waterfall. So, switch to just doing in serial on single thread to save dispatch/sync overhead
  - (x) revert updown.io check to once a minute (to save on credits)
- (x) stable / usable clustering
  - (x) pre-cluster on Rust side
  - (x) don't re-start sim each time
  - (x) fix non-disappearing lines
