- (/) minimal thing which get some semantic content and allows finding similar content
  - (/) get FOSDEM content (pentabarf)
  - (/) look up and store vectors based on title and abstract of event
  - (/) find similar events based on vector distance
    - see `snippets.sql`
- (/) minimal thing which allows querying existing content by an open query
  - (/) connect to remote supabase DB
  - (/) run a query from a local cli to a remote DB
  - (/) call openai for a string and find related events
  - cleanup
    - (/) switch from `dotenv` to `dotenvy` (`dotenv` no longer maintained)
- (/) allow urls for events to be opened
- (/) minimal website that allows searches and showing of links
  - (/) create empty shuttle service
  - (/) extract querying into shared library
  - (x) expose as shuttle service which does query and returns json
    - (/) get working locally
    - (/) add size protections on input
    - (/) publish remotely
  - (/) expose as minimal website with a form which accepts open query and formats results
- (/) add fly.io as an option
  - (/) simple "hello world" axum project working locally
  - (-) building locally in docker (podman)
    - does work, but is very very slow on my M1 (hours)
  - (/) building and running remotely on fly.io
  - (/) extract core of webapp separate from shuttle.rs usage (e.g. just Router)
  - (/) use core in a fly.io shell, but with different secrets to distinguish usage
  - (/) leave deployed side-by-side in both fly.io and shuttle.rs, for a day or so, before declaring fly better
  - (/) remove shuttle support (switch to fly.io)
    - (/) switch plausible.io setup to use fly.dev domain name
    - (/) remove shuttle code and config files
    - (/) upgrade to latest libraries for axum etc (shuttle required older versions)
- (/) show related items
  - (/) show 5 related items per search item
  - (/) speed-up so that finding all related items is faster (less than a second for 20 items)
  - (-) make error-handling more clear in `Queryable`
  - (/) visualise all related items via D3
- (/) use times and durations
  - (/) import and show next to events in display
  - (/) use the time of day to color items in D3 vis
- (/) polish / UI
  - (/) add design system (bulma?)
  - (/) add icons
- (x) general release
  - (/) switch to bespoke domain name, https://fosdem.houseofmoran.io
  - (/) get cert
  - (/) switch plausible.io to domain name
  - (/) switch "home" to always go to https://fosdem.houseofmoran.io
  - (/) add some example queries that you won't find on main site
  - (/) add "connections" to main nav, and use "connections" consistently
  - (/) log what searches people are doing
- (x) spike: remove (external) DB dependency
  - (/) convert `Queryable` into a trait
  - (/) find implementation of Vector distance which works outside of DB (use nalgebra)
  - (/) re-implement Queryable using a "DB" which can just take the CSV files as input
  - (/) deploy to staging and leave running for a few days
  - (x) ...
- (x) more searchable content
  - (x) add author names and dev rooms titles
- (x) stable / usable clustering
  - (x) pre-cluster on Rust side
  - (x) don't re-start sim each time
  - (x) fix non-disappearing lines
