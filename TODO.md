  - (/) simple "hello world" axum project working locally
  - (-) building locally in docker (podman)
    - does work, but is very very slow on my M1 (hours)
  - (/) building and running remotely on fly.io
  - (/) extract core of webapp separate from shuttle.rs usage (e.g. just Router)
  - (/) use core in a fly.io shell, but with different secrets to distinguish usage
  - (/) leave deployed side-by-side in both fly.io and shuttle.rs, for a day or so, before declaring fly better
  - (/) remove shuttle support (switch to fly.io)
    - (/) switch plausible.io setup to use fly.dev domain name
    - (/) remove shuttle code and config files
    - (/) upgrade to latest libraries for axum etc (shuttle required older versions)
- (/) show related items
  - (/) show 5 related items per search item
  - (/) speed-up so that finding all related items is faster (less than a second for 20 items)
  - (-) make error-handling more clear in `Queryable`
